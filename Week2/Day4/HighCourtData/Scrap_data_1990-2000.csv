1.This Criminal  Revision  Petition  has been  preferred  under 
Section  397 of the Code  of Criminal  Procedure  (the Code)  to impugn 
the order  dated 07.08.19 99 passed by the Additional  Sessions  Judge, 
Delhi,  in Sessions  Case No.75/ 1999 “Mad an Lal Kapoor  v. Rajiv  Thapar 
etc.”,  whereby  the the learned  ASJ has disch arged  the accused in the 
aforesaid  complaint  case filed  by the petitioner  under  Sections 
304B /498A/406/109/120B IPC.
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 1 of 12
                2000:DHC:32.The daughter of the complainant/  petitioner  herein, Monica, 
was married  to respondent  No.1  on 30.11. 1991.  She was a medical 
doctor  having  MBBS  degree.   At the time of death  and she was doing  a 
diploma  course  in Gynecology  and Obstetrics  at New Civil Hospital, 
Surat.   Respondent  No.1  Rajiv Thap ar was then  posted  as Assistant 
Directo r in the Directorate  of Revenue  Intelligence,  Surat.   Respondent 
Nos.2  to 5 are the father,  brother,  sister-in-law  and mother, 
respectively,  of the respondent  No.1.   On 26.09 .1992 Monica  died 
while  living  with her husb and at Urmil  Heart Hospital,  Surat.   On 
27.09. 1992, the dead body  of Monica  was brought  by her in-laws to 
Delhi.   The complainant  came to Delhi  from  Chandigarh,  where  he 
resides.   He called  the police  and the police  informed  the SDM.   On 
28.09. 1992 the SDM started  inquest  proceedings  under  Section  176 of 
the Code.   A team  of four experts  was appointed  to conduct  the post 
mortem  of the dece ased.   The petitioner  claims  that he repeatedly 
made  complaints  to various  authorities  in Surat  and Delhi  to the effect 
that there  were  dowry  demand s from  the respondents  and that his 
daughter  had been done  to death by the respondents  on account  of 
the said demand s not being  met.   Eventually,  on 26.07 .1993 the 
petitioner  made a complaint  under  Section  200 of the Code  in the 
Court  of the Metropolitan  Magi strate.   The Magistrate  recorded  the 
statement  of the petitioner  and his son as C-1 and C-2.  On 24.08.1 995 
the learned  Magistrate  took cognizance  and summons  were  issued  to 
the respondents.   On 15.04.19 97 the respondents  moved  an 
application  before  the learned  Magistrate  for recalling  the summoning 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 2 of 12
                2000:DHC:3order.   This application  was rejected  by the learned  MM on 23.05.1 998. 
The learned  Magistrate  supplied  copies  of the complaint  and the 
statements  to the respondents  and committed  the case to the Court  of 
Sessions  for trial under  Section  208 of the Code.   Thereafter,  before 
hearing  argument s on the charge,  the Sessions  Court  summoned  two 
of the doctors,  who had conducted  the post mortem,  and recorded  the 
statement  of one of the four doctors,  namely,  Dr. Banerjee.   On 
07.08. 1999 the impugned  order  was passed, as afores aid, discharging 
the respondents.
3.This Revision  Petition  came up for hearing  before  this Court 
on 19.10 .2000.  The same was dismis sed by a summary  order  stating 
that there  is no infirmity  in the impugned  order.   Special  Leave Petition 
preferred  by the petitioner  was allowed  on 22.02. 2002 by the Supreme 
Court  with  the direction  that this Court  should  apply  its mind 
independently  and pas s a rea soned  order.
4.The Revision  Petition  was again dismissed  in default for 
non-prosecution  on 11.08. 2005.  Once  again,  the Special  Leave 
Petition  preferred  by the petitioner  was allowed  with the direction  to 
the Court  to decide  the case on merits.   That is how the matter  is now 
coming  up for hearing.
5.The submis sion of learned  counsel  for petitioner , firstly,  is 
that a perus al of the impugned  order  would  show  that the learned 
Additional  Sessions  Judge  while  passing  the same has relied  on the 
earlier  decision  of the Supreme  Court  in Satis h Mehra  v. Delhi 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 3 of 12
                2000:DHC:3Administra tion (1996)  9 SCC 766 and keeping  in view the dictum  laid 
down  by the Supreme  Court  in that decision,  has proceeded  to rely on 
documents  and materials  produced  by the accused/respondents  herein 
at the stage of considering  the framing  of charge/discharge  of the 
accused.  This submis sion of the petitioner  is clearly  established  on a 
reading  of the impugned  order  and there  can hardly  be any argument 
about  the same.   I may only reproduce  paragraph  9 of the impugned 
order  for this purpose.   The sa me reads a s follows:  -
“9.I am reminded  of 1996  (3) Crimes  85 (SC) 
Satish  Mehr a Vs. Delhi  Administration  where  the 
apex  court  had stated guidelines  as to how a court 
should  proceed  to determine  whether  a case for 
framing  of charge is made out or not.  In this case, 
the Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  also stated that the 
Sessions  Judge  would  be within  his powers  to 
consider  even materials  which  the accused may 
produce  at the stage contemplated  u/s 227 Cr.P.C.   It 
has also been  pointed  out that if the Sessions  Judge 
is almost  certain  that the trial would  only be an 
exercise  in futility  or sheer  waste of time.   It is 
advis able to truncate  or ship the proceedings  at that 
very stage of the matter.   In para 13, their  lordship 
held as follows:  -
“But when  the Judge  is fairly  certain  that there 
is no prospect  of the case ending  in conviction 
valuable  time  of the Court  should  not be 
wasted for holding  a trial only for the purpose 
of formally  completing  the procedure  to 
pronounce  the conclusion  on a future  date.  We 
are mindul  that most  of the Sessions  Courts  in 
India  are under heavy pres sure of work-load.”
This  Court  can thus  look  into the documents 
produced  by the accused at this stage.   The 
documents  so produced  by the accused  are post-
mortem  report,  inquest  proceedings  recovered  by 
SDM and letters  of complainants.   Obviously,  these 
documents  are indisputable  in nature.   I may now 
refer  to them.”

                2000:DHC:36.After  relying  upon  the decision  in Satish  Mehra  (supra) 
the learned  ASJ has proceeded  to carry  out a meticulous  and in depth 
examin ation  of the post mortem  report,  inquest  proceedings  recorded 
by the SDM,  the report  of CFSL and other  documents  produced  by the 
accused/respondents  before  the learned  Magi strate  along  with 
application  seeking  recall of the summoning  order.   The learned  ASJ 
has also referred  to the medical  texts from  various  authorities  and 
eventually  he has come  to the conclusion  that there  is no ground  to 
charge the accused persons under Section  304B  IPC.
7.The submission  of learned  counsel  for the petitioner  is that 
the decision  of the Supreme  Court  in Satis h Mehra  (supra) stand s 
squarely  overruled  by the larger  Bench  decision  of the same Court  in 
State  of Orissa  v. Debendra  Nath  Padhi  (2005)  1 SCC 568.  In the 
said decision  after discussing  the various  earlier  decisions  rendered  by 
it, the Supreme  Court  in para 23 held that “clearly  the law is that  at 
the time  of framing  charge  or taking  cognizance  the accus ed 
has no right  to produce  any material.   Satish  Mehra  case 
holding  that the trial court  has powers  to conside r even 
materials  which  the accused  may produce  at the stage  of 
Secti on 227 of the  Code  has not been  correctl y decided.”
8.On this basis the submi ssion  of learned  counsel  for the 
petitioner  is that the impugned  decision  is in the teeth  of the decision 
of Supreme  Court  in Debendra  Nath  Padhi  (supra) and that it cannot 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 5 of 12
                2000:DHC:3be sustained.   He further  submits  that the learned  ASJ has gone  into 
the evidence  to find its probative  value  which  is not permitted  in law at 
the stage of framing  of charge.   He submits  that the material brought 
on record  in the case, namely,  the complaint  and the evidence  of C-1 
and C-2 has to be accepted  as true at that stage.  He relies  on State 
of Maharash tra V. Som Nath  Thapa  & Ors. (1996)  4 SCC 659 to 
support  the contention  that at the stage of framing  of charge  probative 
value  of material and record  cannot  be gone  into and the material 
brought  on record  by the prosecution  has to be accepted as  true, and if 
on the basis of materials  brought  on record  the Court  could  come  to 
the conclusion  that commis sion of the offence  is probable,  a case for 
framing  of charge is made out.  He further  submits  that at the stage of 
framing  of charge  the learned  ASJ could  not have  examined  the 
evidence  to appreciate  whether  it is sufficient  or not for convicting  the 
accused.  For this propositi on, he relies  State  of M.P. V Mohan  Lal 
Soni  (2000)  6 SCC 338.  The Court  has only to examine  and be 
satisfied  that the prima  facie case is made out for proceeding  further 
at the stage of framing  of charge.   He further  submits  that the learned 
ASJ while  passing  the impugned  order  has gone  into the evidence  of 
the complainant  meticulously,  which  could  not be done  at the stage of 
consideration  of the matter  on charge.   He relies  on State  of A.P. v. 
Golconda  Linga  Sway  & Anr. (2004)  6 SCC 522 in support  of this 
proposit ion.  Charge  can be framed  if there  are materials  showing 
probabil ity about the commission  of the crime  as against  certainty.   He 
has also placed  on reliance  in Sures h Kumar  Tekriwal  v. State  of 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 6 of 12
                2000:DHC:3Jharkhand  & Anr. (2005)  12 SCC 278, which  is on the same lines as 
the decision  of the Supreme  Court in Debendra  Nath  Padhi (supra).
9.On the other  hand, the submission  of learned  counsel  for 
the respondents  is that at the stage  of consideration  of the charge or 
discharge  of the accu sed, the Court  is entitled  to consider  the record  of 
the case and the documents  submitted  therewith.   He submits  that the 
post mortem  report,  inquest  proceedings  recorded  by the SDM,  report 
of CFSL  and the letters  of the complainant  were  part of the record  of 
the case when  the same was being  considered  by the learned  ASJ, 
since  these documents  had been  filed by the learned  Magistrate  along 
with the respondents'  application  to seek recalling  of the summoning 
order.   He further  submits  that the complainant/petitioner  had resorted 
to suppres sion of relevant  materials  while  filing  the complaint. 
Though,  in the body  of the complaint,  the complainant  had made  a 
reference  to the conduct  of post mortem  at Delhi,  the complainant  had 
failed  to file the same with his complaint.   He submits  that the learned 
Magistrate  should  have required  the complainant  to produce  the said 
report,  since  reference  had been  made  to it in the complaint  itself  and 
the same was also referred  to in the statement  of C-1/complainant.   He 
submits  that resort  to suppres sion of vital documents  and materials  by 
the complainants,  the disclosure  of which  may have  persuaded  the 
learned  Magistrate  not to issue process,  cannot  act to the prejudice  of 
the respondents  by requirin g them  to respond  to the summons  and to 
face trial in a case which,  according  to them,  has no basis.  He further 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 7 of 12
                2000:DHC:3submits  that the post mortem  report,  the inquest  report  and the CFSL 
report  are not the documents  of the respondent/accused.   These are 
documents  prepared  by the statutory  authorities  on the basis of the 
complaint  made by the petitioner .  His submis sion is that the case 
made  out against  the accused is of causing  the unnatural  death  of 
decea sed Monica by the accused on account  of the alleged  demands of 
dowry  of the accused not being  satisfied.   Section  176 of the Code 
obliges  the Magi strate,  empowered  in this behalf,  to hold inquest  when 
the case relates  to the death of a woman  within  7 years of her 
marriage  and any relative  of the woman  has made request  in this 
behalf.   He, therefore,  submits that the inquest report  of the Magistrat e 
ought  to have been looked  into by the concerned  MM even  before 
issuance of  process.
10.The Supreme  Court  in Debendra  Nath  Padhi  (supra)  has 
very clearly and in no uncertain  term s held that at the time of taking 
cognizance  or framing  of charge,  the accused  has no right  to produce 
any material.   As afores aid, Satish  Mehra  (supra) has expres sly been 
overruled  which  held that the trial Court  has the powers  to consider 
even  materials  which  the accused  may produce  at the stage of Section 
227 of the Code.   While  dealing  with the meaning  of the expres sion 
“the record  of the case”, as appearing  in Section  227 of the Code  the 
Supreme  Court  in Debendra  Nath  Padhi  (supra)  has held that though 
the word  'case' is not defined  in the Code,  but Section  209 throws  light 
on the interpretation  to be placed on the said words.   Section  209 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 8 of 12
                2000:DHC:3deals  with the commitment  of the case to the Court  of Sessions  when 
offence  is triable  exclusively by it.  The s aid Section  provides that when 
it appear s to the Magistrate  that the offence  is triable  exclusively  by 
the Court  of Session,  he shall send to that Court,  the record  of the case 
and the documents  and articles,  if any, which  are to be produced  in 
evidence  and notify  the public  prosecutor  of the commital  of the case 
to the Court  of Sessions.   On this basis, the Supreme  Court  observed 
that the record  of the case and documents  submitted  therewith  as 
postulated  in Section  227 relates  to the case and the documents 
referred  to in Section  209.   The Court  further  observed  that no 
provision  in the Code  grants  to the accused any right  to file any 
material  or document  at the stage of framing  of charge.   That right  is 
granted only at the stage of the trial.
11.The present  being  a complaint  case under  Section  208 of 
the Code,  the Magistrat e was obliged  to furnish  to the accused free of 
cost copy  of the follo wing documents: -
(i)the statement s recorded  under  Section  200 or Section  202, of all 
persons examined by the Magistrat e;
(ii)the statement s and confessions,  if any, recorded  under  Section 
161 or Section  164;
(iii)any document  produced  before  the Magistrate  on which  the 
prosecution  proposes to  rely.
12.From  the aforesaid,  it is evident  that documents  which  are 
produced  by the accused before  the Magistr ate, as in the instant case, 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page 9 of 12
                2000:DHC:3the documents  produced  along  with an application  seeks recall of the 
issuance  of process,  are not even  required  to be supplied  to the 
accused at the stage of committal  of the case to the Court  of Sessions. 
These  documents,  therefore,  cannot  be classified  as “the record  of the 
case”.  I, therefore,  do not accept  the submis sion of learned  counsel 
for the respondents  that the documents  produced  by the accused 
before  the learned  Magistrate  along  with their  application  seeking 
recall  of the issuance  of proces s are a part of the record  of the case, 
which  can be looked  in to  under  Section  227 of the Code.  The law does 
not carve  out any exception  in respect  of any document,  whether  it be 
a document  originating  from a public  record  or any document  that may 
be produced  by the accused.  Therefore,  the submission  that the post 
mortem  report,  the inquest  report,  the report  of CFSL etc. were  part of 
a public  record  and not documents  of the accused, also cannot  be 
accepted.
13.The submis sion of the respondent  that the learned 
Magistrate  issued  process  without  application  of mind  and without 
even  calling  for the inquest  report  and the post mortem  report,  even 
though  the post mortem  report  had a reference  in the complaint  and 
the statement  of C-1 also cannot  be accepted  at this stage.  This is so 
becau se the respondents  had initially  challenged  the summoning  order 
before  this Court  by filing  a petition  under  Section  482 of the Code. 
That  petition  was withdrawn  with liberty  to move  the trial Court. 
According ly, the trial Court  was approached  by the respondents.   By a 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page  10 of 12
                2000:DHC:3detailed  order  dated  23.05 .1998 that application  of the accused was 
also rejected.   That order  has attained  finality,  as it was not challenged 
thereafter  by the respondents.   Inste ad, the respondents  chose  to 
participate  in the proceedings  before  the Sessions  Court  and argued  on 
the asp ect of framing of  charge/discharge.
14.Another  submis sion of learned  counsel  for the respondent 
is that, in any event, this Court  is empowered  to quash  the complaint 
by exercising  its power  under  Section  482 of the Code  by looking  into 
the documents  produced  by the accused/respondents.   He refers  to 
para 29 of Debendra  Nath  Padhi  (supra) where  the Supreme  Court 
has held that in cases where  the accused  are having  to face the trial 
despite  being  in a position  to produce  material  of unimpe achable 
character  and sterling  quality,  the width  of the power  of the High Court 
under  Section  482 of the Code  and Article  226 of the Constitution  is 
unlimited  and in the interests  of justice  the High Court  can make such 
orders  as may be nece ssary to prevent  abus e of the process  of the 
Court  or otherwise  to secure  the ends  of justice  within  the parameters 
laid down  in State  of Haryana  v. Bhajan  Lal 1992  Supp  (1) SCC 
335.
15.I am, however,  not inclined  to accept  this submis sion of 
the respondents  at this stage.   This is for the reason that the materials 
and documents  produced  by the respondents,  namely,  the inquest 
report,  the post mortem  report  and the report  of CFSL have  not yet 
been  led in evidence  and proved  on record.   They  cannot  be 
Crl. Rev.  P. No.42/2000 Page  11 of 12
                2000:DHC:3categorised  as documents  of unimpeach able character  and sterling 
quality,  at this st age.
16.For the aforesaid  reasons,  this petition  is allowed  and the 
impugned  order  dated  07.08 .1999 passed by learned  ASJ, Delhi  is 
quash ed.  The parties  except  respondent  Nos.2  & 5, who are the father 
and mother,  respectively,  of the respondent  No.1 and are stated  to be 
about  77 and 71 years of age, are directed  to appear  before  the 
concerned  Sessions  Judge  on 21.07. 2008.  Respondent  Nos.2  & 5 are 
exempted  from  personal  appearance  on the next date.  However,  if 
they wish to seek further  exemption,  it shall be open  to them  to apply 
to the concerned  Court.

1.  This appeal by the Plaintiffs F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd. (`Roche‟)  and 
OSI Pharmaceuticals I nc. (`OSI‟ ) is directed against the judgment dated 19th 
March, 2008 passed by the learned Single Judge of this Court dismissing I.A. 
No. 642/2008  filed by them in their suit CS (OS) No.89/2008 , thereby

 declining the ir prayer for gr ant of an interim injunction to restrain the 
Defendant/Respondent Cipla Limited  from manufacturing,  offering for sale, 
selling and exporting the drug Erlotinib , for which the plaintiff No. 2 claimed 
to hold a patent  jointly with Pfizer Products Inc. The impugned judgment   
nevertheless put the defendant to terms including furnishing an undertaking to 
pay damages to the plaintiffs in the event of the suit being decreed, to maintain 
accounts of the sale of its product Erlocip , file in the court quarterly acco unts 
along with the affidavit of one of its directors, and to file in the court annual 
statement of the sales of Erlocip  duly authenticated by its chartered 
accountants on the basis of its records, including the sales tax and excise 
returns.   
 
2.  For con venience, the appellants are referred to as the plaintiff s and the 
respondent as the defendant.  
 
Case of the Plaintiffs  
3.   In the plaint in the suit CS (OS) No.89 of 2008 it is stated that plaintiff 
No.2 OSI jointly owns a patent with Pfizer Products In c. in respect of a small 
drug molecule medically termed as a “Human Epidermal Growth Factor Type -
1/Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor” (HER/EGFR) inhibitor, popularly 
known as Erlotinib . It is claimed that the said drug marked a major 
breakthrough and innova tion in the treatment of cancer. According to the 
plaintiffs the various tests conducted on Erlotinib  have shown a marked 
increase in the survival benefit in the patients suffering from advanced or 
metastatic non small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) . The metasta tic NS CLC is 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 3 of 57 
 most prevalent form of this cancer.   
 
4. The plaintiff s state that Erlotinib  is administered in the form of a Tablet and 
sold under the trademark and name of „Tarceva ‟, which is registered in the 
name of plaintiff No.1 R oche .  It is claimed t hat Erlotinib  and its formulation 
„Tarceva ‟ have been approved by the U nited States (U .S.) Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the year 2004 and thereafter by the European Union 
(EU) in the year 2005.  On 13th March, 1996  OSI along with Pfizer Products  
Inc. made an application to the Controller General of Patents, Trademarks and 
Designs, New Delhi for grant of a patent in respect of Erlotinib . The Controller 
General of Patents , New Delhi  granted the said applicants a certificate bearing 
Patent No.196774 dat ed 23rd February, 2007 which was subsequently recorded 
in the Register of Patents on 6th July, 2007.  It is submitted that in terms of the 
amendment s to the Patents Act, 1970 („Act‟) in 2005, the product Erlotinib  as 
well as the process of its manufacture stand patented and are entitled to 
protection as such.  The plaintiffs ‟ product Erlotinib  Hydrochloride Tablets 
(Tarceva) was registered by the Central Drug Standard Control Organisation, 
Directorate General of Health Services, Government of India under 
Registration Certificate dated 23rd December 2005 in the name of plaintiff 
No.1 R oche .  
 
5. On 8th January, 2001, plaintiff No.2 OSI and plaintiff No.1 Roche  entered 
into a development collaboration and licensing agreement where by Roche  was 
granted licence to  use and sell and offer for sale the licenced products of the 
former including Erlotinib . Roche was further licence d and authorized to cause 
enforcement of any infringement of property rights of any of the product s of 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 4 of 57 
 plaintiff No.2 OSI .  It is claimed tha t Roche  introduced Tarceva in India some  
time in April 2006.  The announcement regarding the launch of Tarceva by the 
subsidiary of the Roche Group in India was given wide publicity by the media 
inter alia in view of its importance in cancer treatment.   
 
6.  The defendant C ipla Limited  (`Cipla‟) , a company incorporated under the 
Companies Act 1956 and having its registered office at Mumbai , is alleged to 
have announced in the print and electronic media its plan to launch a generic 
version of Tarceva ( Erlot inib) in India.  One such news item appeared on 11th 
January, 2008 in an English daily „Mint ‟ having wide circulation in New 
Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.  The plaintiffs state that from such news report 
they learnt for the first time of Cipla‟s plans to in fringe and violat e the 
plaintiffs‟ rights.  According to the plaintiffs the drug Tarceva ( Erlotinib ) has 
been developed after a long sustained research and after incurring enormous 
expenditure inter alia on the tests which are mandatorily conducted for its  
efficacy and safety.  It was alleged that the said innovation was duly protected 
under law and that no person except those legally authorized to exercise legal 
rights associated with the aforementioned patented drug c ould be allowed or 
permitted to simula te, re -create it in any manner or in any other name.  It was 
alleged that the defendant had no right to opt to manufacture, sell or offer to 
sell any version of the drug Tarceva ( Erlotinib ) and that such action of the 
defendant, as announced by it, would b e in blatant violation of the legal rights 
of the plaintiffs.    
 
7.  In para 20 of the plaint it was asserted that the plaintiffs were under 
imminent threat of violation of their patent rights inter alia at New Delhi.  It 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 5 of 57 
 was further asserted that “the ap plication for the patent of the drug and process 
of manufacture of Tarceva ( Erlotinib ) was made and the patent was granted at 
New Delhi”.  It was argued that, therefore, this Court has territorial jurisdiction 
to adjudicate the suit.  The suit was valued a t Rs. 20 la khs and for the relief of 
damages, it was tentatively value d at Rs.1 crore.  
 
8. The suit was filed on 15th January, 2008.  Along with the suit the plaintiffs 
filed an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 Code of Civil Procedure 1908 
(CPC), I.A. No. 642/2008, seeking ad -interim injunction restraining the 
defendant from infringing the plaintiffs patent in respect of Tarceva  
(Erlotinib ).The two important points  to be noted at this stage are that the 
plaintiff s asserted in the plaint that plaintiff N o.2 was granted a patent for 
Tarceva ( Erlotinib ) jointly with Pfizer Products Inc.  It was stated that the 
certificate bearing patent No. 196774 dated 23rd February, 2007 recorded in the 
Register of Patents on 6th July, 2007  pertained to Erlotinib Hydrochlo ride 
which was marketed as Tarceva . Secondly, in the plaint no details of the 
specification of the aforementioned patent or the x-ray diffraction of the 
product (tablet) Tarceva or the defendant‟s Erlocip  was indicated.  
 
Plea of the defendant in its writte n statement to the injunction application  
9. The suit was listed before the learned Single Judge on 15th January, 2008, on 
which date the defendant appeared.  The case was thereafter listed on 18th 
January, 2008 for the hearing of the application I.A. No. 642/2008 filed by the 
plaintiff s seeking ad -interim injunction.  The defendant filed an application on 
18th January, 2008 for a direction to the plaintiffs to disclose the patent 
specification.  At the hearing on 18th January, 2008, the counsel for the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 6 of 57 
 plaintiff s handed over to the counsel for the defendant the patent specification.   
 
10. On 21st January, 2008, the defendant filed its written statement to the 
injunction application along with documents.  It was stated  that the complete 
specification  which ought to have been disclosed in the plaint was supplied by 
the plaintiffs only at the hearing of the injunction application.  The defendant 
claimed that it had applied for drug approval for the Erlotinib tablet in May 
2007 and the approval was granted in O ctober, 2007.  As on December, 2007 it 
had received approval from the Government of Goa for manufacturing the said 
tablet  in various pack sizes of 30,60,100,500 and 1000 tablets .  The defendant 
had launc hed the product under the mark Erlocip and the said tablet was used 
for treatment of lung cancer.  
 
11. It was pointed in the written statement that in terms of the second proviso 
to Section 1 1-A(7) of the Patents  Act 1970, introduced by the Patents 
(Amendment) Act, 2005  (effective from 1st January, 2005) , in case of patent 
applications filed under Section 5 (2) [which concerns a claim for patent  of an 
invention for a substance itself intended for use, or capable of being used, as 
medicine or drug ] the rights of a patentee accrue only from the date of the 
grant of the patent. It was also pointed out that although a certificate was 
issued to the plaintiffs by the Controller General of Patents bearing Patent 
No.196774 dated 23rd February 2007, the pre -grant opposition was disposed of 
only on 4th July 2007 . There fore the patent could not have been granted with 
effect from 23rd February 2007. It was submitted that the patent certificate was 
accordingly incor rect and the proceedings in the suit ought to be stayed till the 
correct authenticated certificate was produc ed. It was claimed that the patent 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 7 of 57 
 could not be presumed to be valid unless it was more than six years old and 
since the patent was a new one patent and “granted under peculiar and 
suspicious circumstances ” no injunction ought to be granted.   
 
12. It was mentioned in para 15 that the defendant had also filed a counter 
claim along with written statement praying f or the  revocation of the patent 
granted to the plaintiff.  The grounds for revocation raised in the counter -claim 
were asked to be treated as part of the written statement.  
 
13.  In para 16  of the written statement it was specific ally averred that the 
plaintiffs‟ patent “for which the complete specification is yet to be disclosed 
for the drug Erlotinib ” was “completely invalid”.  A reference was mad e to 
Section 3(d) of the Act and it was submitted that Erlotinib  is a derivative of a 
known patent “Quinazoline”.  It was stated that there w ere at least three E U 
patents dat ing back to 1993 which disclose d the Quinazoline derivative.  One 
of the said pate nts disclose d the exact chemical structure as found  in the 
plaintiff‟s patent except for one substitution which is “obvious to any person 
skilled in the art”.   Further, the plaintiff ha d failed to prove that there was “ any 
improved efficacy of the said dr ug”.  No figures or data had been provided in 
support of such claim.  It was claimed that there was no invention or inventive 
step in the patent.  The patent compound would be obvious to a person skilled 
in the art to arrive at.  It was specifically averre d that “the alleged patented 
product is nothing but a derivative from Gefitinib of Astra zeneca for which a 
patent was refused in India”.   
 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 8 of 57 
 14. It was averred  in the written statement that one of the pre -conditions for 
recently granted patent claim to be p rotected was that it ought to be “worked 
fully and commercially”.  It was pointed that the plaintiff got approval for 
importing and selling Erlotinib  only in December 2005 and even as on date the 
product was neither easily available nor affordable due to i ts high pricing.  No 
sales figures for the product for India ha d been given in the plaint in the 
attached documents and not even one invoice had been filed by the plaintiff.  
The plaintiff never chose to obtain exclusive marketing rights (EMRs) during 
the time that the law in India permitted it.   
 
15. The written statement specifically pleaded public interest.  It was pointed 
out that each tablet of the plaintiff s‟ drug Tarceva costs Rs.4,800/ - whereas 
each tablet the defendant ‟s Erlocip costs Rs.1,600/ -. Thus, a one month dosage 
of Tarceva for a patient undergoing treatment for cancer would cost  Rs.1.4 
lakh whereas the equivalent dosage of Erlocip would cost Rs.46,000/ -.  It was 
pointed out that in the context of life saving drugs , it was in the public int erest 
that the drug should be made available at cheap and affordable prices.   
 
16. Along with the written statement, the defendant filed copies of the 
European Patent “Publication No.0566 226 A1” (hereinafter EP‟226) which 
was an application of Astra zeneca Limited in the EU for grant of patent in 
respect of „Gefitinib ‟.  Among the other documents filed by the defendant was 
the decision dated 30th August, 2007 of the Controller of Patents in India  
rejecting the application  by Astra zeneca UK Limited for gran t of patent in 
respect of Gefitinib.  In the said application Astrazeneca UK Limited had cited  
EP‟226 as the prior art  and claimed that Gefitinib involved an inventive step 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 9 of 57 
 with respect to that prior art  and with enhanced efficacy . The Patents 
Controller c oncluded that Gefitinib was “obvious and does not involve an 
inventive step over the prior art EP „226.  It was therefore held to be not an 
invention within the meaning of section 2(1)(j) of the Patents Act, 1970 and no 
patentable invention within the mean ing of section 3(d) of the Patents Act, 
1970.  In its written statement to the injunction application the defendant also 
placed on record the documents pertaining to US Patent No.6900221 (hereafter 
U.S.‟221) filed by OSI in the US for Polymorph -B.  The sai d application was 
filed on 9th November, 2000 and was granted on 31st May, 2005.  
 
Defendant’s counter -claim  
17. In the counter -claim filed by the defendant it was contended that under 
Section 2 (1) (ta) of the Patents Act 1970, inserted by the 2005 amendm ent,  
the expression „pharmaceutical substance‟ has been defined to mean “any new 
entity involving one or more inventive steps” and under Section 2 (1) (l) a 
“new invention” was defined as an invention “which has not been anticipated 
by publication in any document used in the country or elsewhere in the world 
before the date of filing a patent application with complete specification.” It 
was contended that t he suit patent therefore needed a special scrutiny as to the 
question of validity in the light of the  above provisions which were specific to 
inventions in the field of pharmaceuticals.  
 
18. I n para 3. 6 of the counterclaim it was contended by the defendant that the 
plaintiff “had failed to provide any evidence that the compound of claim 1 of 
the impugned  patent possesses significantly enhanced activity over the closest 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 10 of 57 
 compound of the prior art.”  In para 3.7 it was averred that the plaintiffs had not 
provided the relevant data that was required to demonstrate that the claimed 
compound had a higher therape utic efficacy. In para 3.8 a reference was made 
to U.S.‟221  which clearly stated that the compound Erlotinib Hydrochoride 
was a mix ture of two polymorphs A&B  and that one needed to separate and 
purify  the B polymorph  so as to get to the claimed compound  for acceptable 
efficacy.  It was stated that subsequent patent clearly defeated the in ventive  
step of the alleged invention.   
 
19. In para 4 of the counter claim it was averred that the suit patent, i.e., Patent 
No.196774 [ corresponding  to US Patent No.5 747498  – hereafter U.S.‟498]  had 
been obtained by the plaintiffs by suppression of material information.  It was 
stated in para 4.2 as under:  
“It is stated that the patentee knew very well that if it 
discloses the truth that the claimed product is in the 
form of a polymorph then the patent application would 
have been rejected at the outset because there is nothing 
to show that the product has enhanced therapeutic 
effect.  Therefore by suppression of material facts the 
patentee has managed to obtain the impu gned patent by 
by-passing the provisions of Section 3(d).”  
 
20. In para 5.2 of the counter claim the defendant pointed out as under:  
“The present impugned patent fails to disclose that the 
compound of claim 1 of the impugned patent is actually 
a mixture of  polymorphs, which is useless for 
pharmaceutical use.  The patentee has intently and 
capriciously withheld material information that is 
important for practicing the alleged invention disclosed 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 11 of 57 
 in the impugned patent.  Therefore, the defendant states 
that t he specification of the impugned patent does not 
sufficiently describe the invention, particularly with 
regard to compound of claim 1 of the impugned patent.  
The impugned patent is therefore liable to be rejected on 
this ground alone.”  
 
Defendant’s applic ation under O VII R 11 CPC seeking dismissal of the Suit  
21. On 30th January, 2008 the defendant filed an application I.A. No.1272/2008 
before the learned Single Judge seeking dismissal of the suit. The thrust of this 
application was that the defendant ha d discovered that the plaintiff s had made 
two further applications for grant of patent in respect of the same chemical 
compound for a different crystal form which was termed by the plaintiff s as B-
polymorph.  The first application was filed on 14th May, 20 02 and published 
first on May 20, 2005 and thereafter re -published on 23rd February, 2007.  In 
the said application priority was claimed over three US applications one of 
which was U.S.‟ 221.  The second application which was filed on May 13, 2002 
and publi shed on 20th May, 2005 claimed priority over three US applications 
one of which was U.S.‟221 .  It was pointed that the suit patent had claimed 
priority over U .S.‟498 published on 5th May, 1998. A reference was made to 
the statements made by the plaintiff s in U.S.‟221  which showed that the Indian 
patent No.196774 was in relation to the hydrochloride compound in the form 
of mixture of polymorph s A and B which was known to the plaintiffs way back 
in the year 2000 since this corresponded to U.S.‟498 which was g ranted in 
1998 itself.  However, this fact was never stated in the application made before 
the Patent Controller. Since the admitted position of the plaintiff s was that 
patent No.196774 was not a preferred form for manufacture of tablets , the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 12 of 57 
 defendant was  curious to know how the plaintiffs were still importing and 
selling tablets of the said Hydrochloride compound under the brand “Tarceva”.  
It sought to determine the actual crystalline structure of the tablets and 
accordingly purchased some manufactured i n August 2006 from the local 
market. The x-ray diffraction data of Tarceva sold in India showed that it was 
“B-Polymorph of the Hydrochloride”. This was confirmed by the defendant‟s 
expert Mr. Manish G. Gangrade who performed the technical evaluation . On 
an analysis of the X-ray diffraction pattern h e came to the follwoing 
conclusion :  “Tarceva tablets are wholly B polymorph of the hydrocholoride 
salt of N -(3-ethynylphenyl) -6, 7 bis(2 -methoxyethoxy) -4-quinazolinamine. I 
further say that the X -ray powder dif fraction of Tarceva clearly goes to show 
that it is not A polymorph or a mixture of A and B polymorph but is wholly B 
polymorph of the said compound .”  
 
22. It was stated in para s 12, 14 and 15 of the application as under:  
“12. The plaintiff in its various  pleadings has claimed 
that the patented drug has been sold by it in India since 
April, 2006, meaning thereby the drug which is sold in 
India is the drug for which the patent has already been 
granted, i.e., Patent No.196774.  However, an analysis 
of the dr ug which is sold in India and the patent which 
is registered as also the patent which is pending in 
India reveals that the case of the plaintiff is completely 
false.  The drug sold by the plaintiff in India 
appears to relate to the said pending patent 
appl ications and not the granted patent No.196774 .   
……  
14. It is, thus, obvious that the plaintiff has come 
to this Hon‟ble Court with a completely false and 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 13 of 57 
 incorrect case.  The plaintiff has deliberately failed to 
file the patent specification in the first place by 
claiming confidentiality.  When the defendant showed 
that as per the statute a patent specification is a public 
document the plaintiff was forced to reveal the same.  
Now it has come to light that the drug which is 
marketed by the plaintiff is not  at all the product for 
which the alleged patent has been obtained.  The 
patent application for the drug which is marketed by 
the plaintiff is still pending in the patent office.  The 
plaintiff has also suppressed the fact that it has made 
two further Pate nt Applications for the same 
compound, i.e. hydrochloride salt of N(3 
ethynylphenyl) -6, 7 -bis (2 -methoxyethoxy) -4 
quinazolinamine in B -Polymorph form.  The 
defendant has already filed pre -grant oppositions 
against the said patent applications.  Copy of the  said 
pre-grant oppositions for patent application No. 
IN/PCT/2002/00507 and Pate nt application 
No.IN/PCL2002/00497 are annexed as Annexure E -6 
and Annexure E -7.  For ready reference the defendant 
is annexing herewith copies of the US Patent Nos. 
5747498 a nd 6900221 downloaded from the USPTO.  
The said patent no. 5747498 corresponds to Indian 
Patent No.196774 which is the alleged equivalent of 
the patent which is subject matter of the present suit, 
while US Patent No.6900221 corresponds to the two 
aforesaid  applications against which the opposition is 
filed by the defendant.  The patent specification of 
Patent application No.IN/PCT/2002/00507 is annexed 
as annexure E -8 and the patent specification of Patent 
application No. IN/PCT/2002/00497 is annexed as 
Annexure E -9. 
15. It is, thus, submitted that the entire case of the 
plaintiff is based on a false premise.  The plaintiff is 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 14 of 57 
 obviously not marketing the drug which is 
allegedly covered by the patent which is already 
granted.  The drug which is being marketed  is a 
drug which is related to the subsequent patent 
applications in India which are pending. These 
facts ought to have been disclosed by the plaintiff 
before this Hon’ble Court . The plaintiff has 
deliberately claimed in its pleadings that the sales of 
the patented drug are approx Rs.13.91 crores when it 
was well aware that the drug which is being 
manufactured and marketed by it is still pending for 
patent protection.  Therefore, there has been no sale of 
the product form patented under No.196774.”  
(emphasi s supplied)  
 
23. However, while notice was directed to issue in the application  on 31st 
January 2008, on that very date the argument s in the injunction application I.A. 
No.642/2008 w ere concluded before the learned Single Judge and order s 
reserved. Thus  in the impugned judgment  the learned Single Judge did not 
advert to I.A. No.1272/2008 although a  refer ence was made in the passing to 
the facts concerning polymorph -B.   
 
Summary of conclusions of the learned Single Judge  
24. The summary of the conclusions a rrived at by the learned Single Judge in 
the impugned judgment dated 19th March, 2008 are as under:  
(i) Section 3(d) of the Patents Act, 1970 was not merely clarificatory 
of the pre -existing law as contended by the plaintiff s. The 
Parliament consciously en acted a standard of known obviousness 
as a pre -condition of patentability; it also excluded the derivatives 
of known substances unless they differed significantly in properties 
with regard to efficacy.   
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 15 of 57 
 (ii)  In patent infringement actions the court shoul d not presume that a 
patent is valid especially if the defendant challenges it; the test to 
be applied in such event is to find out if the challenge by the 
defendant is genuine as opposed to a vexatious one and further that 
the defendant has “an arguable c ase”.   
(iii)  In the instant case although the plaintiff s‟ case was arguable and 
disclosed prima facie merit , it had to answer the “credible 
challenge” raised by the defendant to the validity of the patent . 
(iv)  The order dated 4th July 2007 of the Contr oller of Patents appeared 
to have readily accepted the contention of the plaintiffs that the 
inventive step claimed was not obvious to the unimaginative 
person skilled in the art and that the substitution of methyl for 
ethynyl in the third position was not  contained in the documents 
submitted by the defendant. The Controller of Patents failed to 
appreciate that this was the plaintiffs‟ response to the anticipation 
argument and was different from the defendant‟s objection on the 
ground of obviousness.  
(v)    There was merit in the plea of the defendant that comparative data 
regarding efficacy of the plaintiffs‟ drug, with existing drugs, was 
not independently shown at the time of examination of the claim 
by the Controller of Patents to establish that the pro duct differed 
significantly in regard to its efficacy from the known substance or 
derivative.  
(vi)  The court cannot be unmindful of the general access to life saving 
products and the possibility that such access would be denied if 
injunction was granted.   If the Court was of the opinion that the 
public interest in granting an injunction in favour of the plaintiff 
during the pendency of an infringement action  is outweighed by 
the public interest of ensuring easy and affordable access to a life 
saving drug,  the balance should tilt  in favour of the lat ter.  In the 
instant case irreparable injury would be caused to the public if the 
injunction was granted as they would be deprived of the 
defendant‟s product . Several unknown persons who are not parties 
to the s uit and who would be deprived of the life saving drug 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 16 of 57 
 would not be able to be restituted in m onetary  terms for the 
damage that would be caused to them  if the injunction were 
granted . 
(vii) The injunction was accordingly refused subject to conditions 
alread y adverted to in the earlier paragraphs.  
 
25. This court while admitting the appeal by an order dated 22nd April 2008 did 
not stay the operation of the impugned judgment.  However, it restrained the 
defendant from exporting Erlocip  to countries where the a ppellants have a 
registered patent during the pendency of the appeal.  
 
26. At the request of the parties, the appeal was taken up for expeditious final 
hearing.  Mr. Parag Tripathi and Dr. A.M. Singhvi, learned Senior Advocates 
appeared for the plaintiffs and Mr. Arun Jaitley, learned Senior Advocate and 
Ms. Pratibha Singh, learned Advocate appeared for the defendant.  
 
Plaintiffs’ subsequent application for grant of patent in respect of 
Polymorph B  
27. In this  appeal, one of the significant issues posed by the defendant , which 
has a bearing on whether the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie case for 
grant of injunction , is that the specification for the suit patent (i.e. patent 
No.196774 corresponding to U.S.‟498) showed that it was in respect of 
Erlotini b Hydrchloride Polymor phs A+B which was on their own showing an 
unstable form which could not be administered  as such . It was contended that 
the case of the plaintiffs themselves was that it was Polymorph B which was 
the more stable form of the compound which could be administered in the 
tablet form. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the tablet Tarceva showed that it 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 17 of 57 
 corresponded to Polymorph B for which the plaintiffs did not yet hold a patent.  
Their application for the grant of patent for Polymorph B was p ending 
consideration. It was submitted that therefore not even a prima facie case was 
made out by the plaintiffs since they were seeking an injunction against the 
defendant in respect of a drug for which they did not yet hold a patent.  
Moreover, t his fact  had been suppressed by the plaintiffs both before the 
Controller of Patents as well as in the suit.  On this sole ground injunction 
ought to have been refused.  
 
28. It was pointed out by learned Senior Counsel for the defendant that t he 
plaintiff s had been changing their stand in regard to polymorph B in the 
pending application before the Controller of Patents and during the hearing of 
the present appeal.  Clearly the plaintiff s were  trying to mislead both this court 
as well as Controller of Patents to the effect that Polymorph B was subsumed 
in Polymorphs A and B. In fact it was initially contended before the Patents 
Controller that the closest prior art i.e. U.S.‟498  did not teach a compound of 
Polymorph B free of Polymorph A whereas in the subsequent le tter dated 18th 
August 2008 the plaintiffs sought to contend that the earlier compound 
(polymorphs A and B) included all known and unknown polymorphs.   If in 
fact Tarceva corresponded to polymorph s A and B, there was no need for the 
plaintiff s to have appl ied for a separate patent in respect of polymorph B.  In 
any event  polymorph B also could not be granted a patent since it was not 
patentable under Section 3 (d) and further the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate 
any enhanced efficacy over the known closest prior art polymorph s A and B. It 
is pointed out that in the published literature pertaining to the history of Roche, 
which was placed on record by the plaintiffs themselves, it was claimed that 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 18 of 57 
 Tarceva was invented only in 2004. Clearly therefore Polymorph  B form of 
Erlotinib Hydrochloride (which was the tablet form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride 
and marketed as Tarceva) was not known to the plaintiffs at the time they 
applied for a patent for Erlotinib Hydrochloride as a combination of 
Polymorphs A and B . Therefore Polymorph B could not be said to be 
subsumed in the compound of a combination of Polymorphs A and B .   
 
29. The response of the plaintiffs to this contention was that t he fact that the y 
had applied for a se parate  patent  in respect of Polymorph B woul d make no 
differen ce to the claim based on the granted patent in respect of Polymorph s A 
and B.  This was because Polymorph B was subsumed in the compound which 
was a mixture of polymorph s A and B. As regards non -mention of the above 
facts before the learn ed Single Judge it is submitted that the application for 
Polymorph B was independent of the patent validly granted to the plaintiffs in 
respect of Polymorphs A and B. Inasmuch as even the defendant had in the 
written statement proceeded on the footing that  the plaintiffs held a patent for 
Tarceva, and had therefore raised a challenge to the validity of the said patent, 
the Learned Single Judge was justified in not adverting to the contentions 
raised in the counter -claim and the I.A.1272  of 2008 while decidi ng the 
injunction application. It is further submitted that since the counter -claim and 
the I.A.1272  of 2008 were pending consideration before the learned Single 
Judge, this Court should not in deciding this appeal advert to the contentions 
raised therein.   
 
30.  Since this is an issue that did not arise for consideration before the learned 
Single Judge, and has been specifically raised in the appeal, this Court 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 19 of 57 
 proposes to deal with it first. It must be noted at the outset that by the time the 
learned sing le Judge took up for consideration I.A. No. 642/2008 filed by the 
plaintiff seeking the ad  interim injunction, the defendant had already filed I.A. 
No. 1272  of 2008 under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC.  It had also filed a counter 
claim.  In both these documents the  defendant raised the plea that the suit 
patent pertain ed to Polymorph A + B whereas Tarceva was Polymorph B.  The 
detailed sequence of the proceedings before the learned Single Judge have 
already been adverted to earlier in this judgment. The contents of t he counter -
claim and the IA 1272 of 2008 have also been set out in some detail and 
therefore need not be repeated. The fact remains that while the above fa ct 
concerning Polymorph B was noticed by the learned single Judge in the 
passing in para 43 of the impugned judgment , the learned Single Judge had no 
occasion to consider whether this was a relevant factor for de termining if the 
plaintiff s had made out a prima facie case for grant of injunction in their 
favour.   
 
31. This Court does not find merit in the  contention of the plaintiffs that since 
the counter -claim and I.A. 1272 of 2008 are pending before the learned Single 
Judge, and in any event the contents thereof have not been discussed in the 
impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge, this Court sho uld not make 
any observation in that regard which might prejudice the case of the plaintiffs. 
The position is that the entire record of the case before the learned single Judge 
before this Court .  It contain s both the counter claim as well as I .A. No. 1272  
of 2008 . While this Court is not deciding either the counter -claim or the I.A. 
1272 of 2008, it is not possible to accept the plea of the plaintiff s that the 
contents thereof are not relevant for deciding whether the plaintiffs had made 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 20 of 57 
 out a prima facie case before the learned single Judge for grant of injunction in 
their favour.   
 
32. To recapitulate the contention of the defendant is that the plaintiff s 
suppressed the fact of their having filed a separate application for Polymorph B 
both before the Cont roller of Patents as well as the learned Single Judge. The 
effect of t he pendency of the latter application of the plaintiffs for Polymorph 
B on the grant of patent in their favour in respect of Polymorphs A and B has 
to be examined.  
 
33. The plaintiffs o wn case before the Controller of Patents in their 
„clarificatory‟ letter dated 18th August 2008 is that while in the U.S.A “it is 
perfectly possible and routinely done to patent incremental inventions e.g. 
Polymorph B of the main compound in addition to th e 
main/dominating/umbrella compound”, in India this is possible only subject to 
the conditions specified in Section 3 (d) of the Patents Act 1970. In other 
words Section 3 (d) read with its Explanation is, in the context of 
pharmaceutical products, an anti -evergreening provision.  In the subsequent 
application for Polymorph B, the plaintiffs asserted that “polymorph B is 
claimed to be thermodynamically mo re stable and it helps in providing 
improved oral dosage in solid form .” Although the plaintiffs were qu ick to 
add that this did not mean that the umbrella compound and all possible 
polymorphs thereof whether singly or in mixtures “were not useful and could 
not be used in solid oral dosage form”, it does not answer a fundamental 
question that arises and whic h is this. Had the Controller of Patents while 
examining the plaintiffs‟ claim in respect of the compound which was a 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 21 of 57 
 mixture of Polymorphs A and B been informed or was cognizant of the fact 
that there was another application pending in respect of Polymorp h B in which 
the above statement was made by the plaintiffs, would he have not had to 
account for it while deciding the question whether the compound, as a 
combination of Polymorphs A and B,  was demonstrated as showing enhanced 
efficacy over the closest p rior art ? From the plaintiffs‟ own showing it would 
not have been possible for the Controller of Patents to have granted a patent in 
their favour both in respect of  Polymorphs A and B as well as Polymorph B. If 
the compound which was a combination of Polym orphs A and B was an 
inventive step over its closest prior art (EP‟226) then clearly Polymorph B was 
only a different crystal form thereof and would fail th e tests of novelty and 
obviousness . However the patentability tests do not stop there. Section 3 (d)  
requires the demonstration of enhanced efficacy of the product. Although it 
was urged by the plaintiffs that stability of a product is not the same thing as its 
efficacy, it would have to be demonstrated by the Plaintiffs, particularly in 
light of their s tatements in the application for grant of a patent in respect of 
Polymorph B (and the ir statements in the corresponding patent U.S.‟221) that a 
compound of Polymorphs A and B (and not A alone or B alone) could be 
orally administered as a drug. It is hard t o imagine that the therapeutic efficacy 
of a pharmaceutical product could be tested without it even being able to be 
administered to a sample population.  
 
34. This brings us to another significant issue. Should not an applicant for a 
patent of a pharmaceu tical product be bound to disclose the details of all other 
applications made by the applicant for grant of patent of derivatives or forms 
of such product? For instance, in the instant case the application for grant of 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 22 of 57 
 patent for Polymorphs A and B (the su it patent) was considered by the 
Controller of Patents in February 2007 and a certificate No. 196774 dated 23rd 
February 2007 was issued by him. The pre -grant opposition to the suit patent 
was considered thereafter and rejected by the order dated 6th July 2007. By this 
time the plaintiffs had already filed two applications, on 13th and 14th May 
2002, for grant of patent in respect of Polymorph B of the compound of 
Polymorphs A and B. In these applications a reference was made to both 
U.S.‟498 and U.S‟221 wh ich were for Polymorphs A and B and Polymorph B 
alone respectively.  
 
35. At this stage it may be useful to refer to the U.S‟221 which was granted to 
the plaintiffs for Polymorph B. The title begins with the words “ Stable 
Polymorph  on N -(3-Ethnylphenyl) -6, 7-Bis (2 Methoxyethoxy) -4-
Quinazolinamine Hydrochloride, Methods of Production, and Pharmaceutical 
Uses thereof.” In the said document a reference is made to the earlier US 
Patent No.5747498 issued on May 5, 1998 (which corresponds to Erlotinib 
Hydroclori de a combination of Polymorphs A&B).  A reference was made to 
the mesylate form of the compound which is easily deliverable according to 
parenteral methods of administration. By contrast, the hydrochloride 
compound was stated to be “preferred with respect to solid administration such 
as with tablets and oral administration”. The „Summary‟ of the invention stated 
that the “present invention relates to polymorphs, and methods for the selective 
production of polymorphs of N -(3-Ethnylphenyl) -6,7-Bis(2Methoxyeth oxy)-4-
Quinazolinamine Hydrochloride,  particularly in the stable polymorph form”.  
It was further disclosed in the said application as under:  
“Stability of the hydrochloride compound is of concern for its use 
in the treatment of patients since variations will affect effective 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 23 of 57 
 dosage level and administration. It has been discovered that the 
hydrochloride of N -(3-ethynylphenyl) -6.7 bis(2 -methoxyethoxy) -
4-quinazoliamine exists in two polymorph states, polymorph A 
and B.  This contrasts with the mesylate compo unds which exist 
in three polymorph states (mesylate polymorphs A, B and C). 
Polymorph B of the hydrochloride was found to be the 
thermodynamically most stable and desirable form and the present 
invention comprises the polymorph B compound in the 
substanti ally pure polymorphic B form and pharmaceutical 
compositions of the substantially pure form of polymorph B, 
particularly in tablet form and a method of the selective 
production of the compound.  
The hydrochloride compound disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 
5,747,498 actually comprises a mixture of the polymorphs A and 
B, which, because of its partially reduced stability (i.e. from the 
polymorph A component), was not more preferred for tablet form 
than the mesylate salt forms.”  
 
36. In the subsequent Polymorph B patent specification the plaintiff admitted 
that “the Hydrocholoride compound disclosed in the US patent no. 5747498 
actually comprised a mixture of Polymorphs A and B, which, because of its 
partially reduced stability (i.e from the Polymorph A component) was not more 
preferred for tablet form than the mesylate salt forms. ”  It was further stated 
that “Polymorph B of the Hydrochloride was found to be the 
thermodynamically mo st stable and desirable form and the present invention 
comprises the Polymorph B com pound in the substantially pure Polymorphic B 
form and pharmaceutical composition s of the substantially pure form of 
Polymorph B, particularly in tablet form and a method of the selective 
production of the compound.”  
  
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 24 of 57 
 37. Had the Controller of Patents bee n cognizant of this fact when he 
considered the application for the grant of the suit patent, he would have had to 
address the issue whether it was the combination of Polymorphs A and B or 
Polymorph B alone which satisfied all the patentability test s vis-a-vis Section 3 
(d). He would have asked to examine in some detail what was in fact claimed 
and stated in U.S.‟498 and U.S.‟221.   It may be noted that the application for 
U.S.‟498 was made on 28th May 1996 and granted on 5th May 1998. The 
application for U. S.‟221 was made on 9th November 2000 and granted on 31st 
May 2005. So by the time Patent No. 196774 was granted on 23rd February 
2007 to the plaintiffs, the facts concerning U.S.‟498 and U.S.‟221 were already 
known to the plaintiffs.  The failure by the pl aintiffs to bring the above facts to 
the notice of the Controller of Patents at the time of consideration of their 
application for patent for the compound of a combination of Polymorphs A and 
B was not consistent with the requirement of a full disclosure. The plaintiffs 
cannot be heard to say that after all the applications for grant of patent in 
respect of Polymorph B were pending before the Controller of Patents and he 
should have known that fact any way. It is perfectly possible that the 
Controller of Pa tents might not know, unless his attention is drawn to the fact, 
of other pending applications concerning the derivatives and forms of the 
product in question. It is also possible that the pre -grant oppose r is not aware 
of them. Certainly the applicant wou ld, as in this case, know how many more 
applications it has filed which are pending consideration. It would know what 
statements it made in the corresponding patents granted to it elsewhere. This 
would be relevant not only for the test s of novelty and obvi ousness but of 
efficacy as well.  
 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 25 of 57 
 38. There is more to the effect of non -disclosure by the plaintiffs to the 
Controller of Patents of the fact of their pending applications for Polymorph B 
when their application for the product being a combination of Polymorph s A 
and B was being considered. This Court notices that the plaintiffs have in their 
reply to the pre -grant opposition of the defendant to their application for grant 
of patent in respect of Polymorph B, and later in their letter dated 18th August 
2008 addressed to the Controller of Patents , acknowledged their contradictory 
stands . The plaintiffs‟ stand initially was that U.S.‟498 (which corresponded to 
Indian Patent No. 196774) “does not contain an unambiguous disclosure of 
Polymorph B free of Polymor ph A.” In para 9.4 of their reply to the opposition 
of the defendant the plaintiffs stated: “There is no indication in the US‟498 that 
there are different polymorphs of hydrochloride salt.” In para 10.2 of the reply 
to the opposition it was stated that the  Polymorph forms were not deemed to be 
within the prior art; that the US „498 (suit patent) was silent on the Polymorphs 
and so was the suit patent which was granted in 2007.  It was further contended 
in para 10.3 that the inventors unexpectedly discovered  in an around 1999 that 
Polymorph B had superior stability properties that made it particularly suited 
for solid oral dosage forms. It was contended in para 11.3 “the stable 
Polymorph B had been successfully used in human clinical trials before the 
examina tion of the application of the impugned patent and much prior to the 
filing of the suit.”  Even in the US the stand of the plaintiff while prosecuting 
its Polymorph B patent was that although the lung cancer was mentioned in 
„498 patent, NSCLC was not. The  stand of the plaintiff, therefore, appears to 
be that Polymorph A + B of Erlotinib Hydrochloride covered under the US 
„498 deals with lung cancer and not with NSCLC.  However, i n their 
„clarificatory‟ letter dated 18th August 2008 the plaintiffs did a „fl ip-flop‟ and 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 26 of 57 
 contended that U.S.‟498 “is for the main compound erlotinib hydrochloride 
which includes all possible polymorphs of main compound known and 
unknown.” Also, they sought to contend that what they were claiming was a 
„selection invention‟ limited  only to Polymorph B which is substantially free of 
Polymorph A. While this Court is not called upon to comment on whether this 
flip flop is permissible or tenable , it is plain that the change in stand would 
admittedly have a direct impact on the question of patentability of either a 
compound of Polymorphs A and B or of Polymorph B free of Polymorph A. 
This made the full disclosure by the plaintiffs of all the facts pertaining not 
only to the „umbrella‟ compound but the crystal or other forms of the product  
to the Controller of Patents imperative. It can be said with some certainty that 
such disclosure would have impacted the decision on the patentability of 
compound of Polymorphs A and B. When the defendant therefore questioned 
the validity of Patent No.196 774 on the above ground, it did raise a more than 
credible challenge.  
 
39. The effect of non -disclosure of the above facts by the plaintiffs in their 
plaint in the suit  will be considered next . Admittedly the  plaintiffs  did not 
disclose the above facts ev en while they asserted that Patent No.196774 
covered the product being marketed by them as Tarceva. The plaintiffs should 
have been candid and disclose d to the Court that they had filed separate 
applications for Polymorph B . They may have taken the plea, a s they did 
repeatedly before this Court, that the subsequent application for Polymorph B 
was out of abundant caution and that Polymorph B was subsumed in the 
compound which was a combination of Polymorphs A and B . However , this 
was not done and this Court has had no valid explanation offered by the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 27 of 57 
 plaintiffs for this non -disclosure.  Also, it may be recalled that the plaintiffs 
also did not disclose the complete specification of the product till the defendant 
filed an application seeking the information. T here could well be a situation 
where the plaintiffs were pressing for an ex parte ad interim injunction. The 
effect of the failure to disclose the complete specification of the product and 
the facts concer ning the pending applications for Polymorph B would  be that 
the learned Single Judge would not have the occasion to consider if in fact  the 
suit patent covered Tarceva. This, in the considered view of this Court , is 
sufficient ground to hold that the plaintiffs in fact failed to demonstrate before 
the lear ned Single Judge and even before this Court that notwithstanding the 
pending applications in respect of Polymorph B which wholly corresponded to 
the tablet  Tarceva, they had a prima facie case.   
 
40. This Court holds that in an application seeking ad inter im injunction in a 
suit for infringement of patent, it would be incumbent on the plaintiffs to make 
a full disclosure of the complete specification  of the product whose patent is 
claimed to have been infringed .  The plaintiffs will also have to disclose to  
Court the x -ray diffraction data of the product, particularly if it is a 
pharmaceutical drug. The plaintiffs have to make an unequivocal disclosure 
that the patent they hold covers the drug in question; whether there are any 
other pending applications see king the grant of patent in respect of any 
derivatives or forms of the product for which they already hold a patent and the 
effect of such applications on the suit patent. Short of the above details, the 
Court being approached for the grant of an ad interi m relief will be unable to 
form a view on whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case. 
Otherwise it would be a case of suppression of material facts that would have a 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 28 of 57 
 bearing on the question.  
 
41. Reverting to the case on hand, what is significa nt is that when the plaintiffs 
filed their suit in this Court they was fully aware of the fact that Polymorph B 
was the more stable form of Erlotinib Hydrochloride.  For marketing it in the 
tablet form, it was Polymorph B, which would be relevant.  The pla intiffs 
knew that a separate application for grant of patent for Polymorph B had been 
made and obtained in the USA.  They knew that in the USA while being 
granted that patent (which although an exercise in evergreening is stated to be 
permissible there), i t was claimed that the closest prior art U.S.‟498 was for 
treatment of lung cancer in general not NSCLC in particular.  The enhanced 
efficacy was sought to be thus justified.  In short their case was that on its own 
strength Polymorph B of Erlotinib Hydroc hloride deserved an exclusive patent 
on the ground of inventiveness and enhanced efficacy, non -obviousness and 
non-teaching by any prior art.  Clearly the applications made by the plaintiff 
before the Controller of Patents for grant of patent in respect of  Polymorph B 
was on the same lines. It is indeed in intriguing why the plaintiffs did not chose 
to be candid with this Court in making a full disclosure of all the above facts in 
its plaint.  Th ere can be no manner of doubt that had these facts fully discl osed 
in the plaint and the entire specification of the patent held by the plaintiff 
together with X -ray diffraction data of Tarceva and Erlocip filed along with the 
plaint, it is possible that the plaintiff may have had difficulty in showing that 
the paten t held by it (No.196774) covered Tarceva as well. In other words, the 
Court would have had to first be convinced that the plaintiffs held a patent for 
the product which was marketed as Tarceva and further that the product of the 
defendant had a x -ray diffr action data which matched Tarceva as well as the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 29 of 57 
 compound which was a combination of Polymorphs A and B and not 
Polymorph B alone.  
 
 
42. The case of the defendant is founded on the proviso to Section 11 A (7) of 
the Patents Act 1970 which states: “Provide d that the applicant shall not be 
entitled to institute any proceedings for infringement until the patent has been 
granted.” An off shoot of this argument is that the plaintiffs are admittedly not 
commercially exploiting the patent granted in their favour for a compound 
which is a mixture of Polymorphs A and B, since the tablet form corresponds 
to Polymorph B of the said compound Erlotinib Hydrochloride. In Franz 
Xaver Huemer  v. New Yash Engineers AIR 2000 Del 23  a Division Bench of 
this Court held that the  patent of a product which is not being commercially 
utilized cannot be enforced. The defendant must be held as having been able to 
demonstrate prima facie that the plaintiffs are not entitled to enforce Patent 
No.196774 as such.  
 
43. Therefore, this Cour t holds that to the extent that the defendant has raised a 
serious doubt whether the plaintiffs in fact hold a patent for the product sold in 
the tablet form as Tarceva, the plaintiffs must be held not to have been able to 
cross the first hurdle of showing  that they have a prima facie case in their 
favour for grant of an order restraining the defendant from marketing Erlocip.  
 
The effect of the order dated 15th December 2008 of the Controller of Patents  
44. After the orders were reserved in the present appeal, the application filed 
by the plaintiff for grant of patent in respect of Polymorph B was rejected by 
the Controller of Patents by an order dated 15th December 2008 .  The said 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 30 of 57 
 order has been placed on record along with CM No. 219/2009 filed by the 
plaintiff in the present appeal . A perusal of the said order shows that the 
rejection was on the ground that the applicant had failed to provide 
comparative data compared to prior art U.S.‟498 to show any enhancement in 
the therapeutic efficacy of the polymorp h B. Even for the stability and 
bioavailability they claimed, no data was provided vis-à-vis the prior art 
U.S.‟49 8 compound. It was further held: “A mere difference in physical 
property is a well known conventional variation of the same pure substance not  
showing an unobvious  properties.  Therefore, the changes alleged by the 
applicant  is in the physical properties and not in the therapeutic efficacy. I 
therefore conclude that claim 1 and 2 are not patentable under Section 3 (d) of 
the Patent (Amendment) Ac t.” Claim 6 of the plaintiffs in relation to 
composition comprising polymorph B form of Erlotinib was also struck down. 
The process claims of the plaintiffs in relation to Polymorph B have been set 
down for hearing.  
 
45. It is sought to be contended by the  plaintiff s that since their application for 
a patent in respect of the product Polymorph B form of Erlotinib  stands 
rejected, the said order “sets at rest the argument of the respondent regarding 
the Polymorph B application prejudicing and invalid ating  the present suit or 
the claim of the appellants for an interlocutory injunction.”  It was submitted 
that since the application has been rejected on the ground of non -patentability 
in terms of Section 3 (d), the Controller of Patents had by implication accepte d 
the argument that Polymorph B was subsumed in Polymorphs A and B. 
However, in the reply to the application it has been contended by the defendant 
that this is a misreading of the order dated 15th December 2008 of the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 31 of 57 
 Controller of Patents . It is pointed that the plaintiff‟s application for 
Polymorph B was rejected on the ground of failure by them to demonstrate 
enhanced therapeutic efficacy over the closest prior art , U.S.‟498 . The 
plaintiffs filed a separate application for Polymorph B since they claimed  that 
it was only during further studies and research on Erlotinib Hydrochloride that 
they found that it was Polymorph B which could be made into a tablet form 
and not the Erlotinib Hydrchloride prepared according to Example 20 of the 
suit patent. It is su bmitted that after the rejection of their application for a 
patent for Polymorph B, the plaintiffs cannot be expected to be in a better 
position against the defendant than when the said application was pending.  
 
46. This Court is not aware with the plaint iffs wish to further p ursue  its 
application for grant of patent in respect of Polymorph B by challenging the 
order dated 15th December 2008 passed by the Controller of Patents. This 
Court therefore refrains from commenting on the said order.  Whatever be th e 
outcome in the said proceedings , the fact remains that when the Controller of 
Patents passed the order dated 6th July 2007 negativing the pre -grant opposition 
to Patent No.196774, none of the facts pertaining to the separate applications 
for Polymorph B were accounted for. Those facts did have a bearing on the 
issue of patentability of the compound which was a combination of 
Polymorphs A and B. The order dated 15th December 2008 also makes no 
change to the position as regards the failure of the plaintiffs  to make out a 
prima facie case before the learned Single Judge.  
 
47. The learned Single Judge proceeded on the footing that the plaintiff  in fact 
had a valid patent in its favour for the product Tarceva and proceeded to 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 32 of 57 
 examine whether despite the plainti ffs holding such patent, it can be denied 
injunction.  However, in view of the above decision of this Court the case has 
attained a different complexion.  This Court finds that the plaintiff s ought to 
have been refused injunction for their failure to make o ut a prima facie case.  
 
48. This court nevertheless proposes to consider the points raised in the appeal 
independent of the finding on the issue of maintainability since extensive 
arguments have been addressed on th is aspect .   
 
Principles that should gov ern while considering an application for grant of 
an injunction in a suit for infringement of a patent  
 
49.  The submission of the appellant is that once the plaintiff has been able to 
show that it has a prima facie case, injunction should automatically fo llow.  
Since the plaintiffs hold a valid patent in respect of Erlotinib Hydrochloride 
(polymorphs A&B), which was not shown by the defendant to have been 
obtained by fraud, the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of infringement  
and an injunction sho uld automatically follow. It is submitted that that the 
patent granted to the plaintiff s in the instant case has undergone multiple level 
scrutiny and examination in terms of the procedures outlined under the Patents 
Act, 1970 as amended in 2005.  The publ ication of the application under 
Section 11(A)(7), the request for examination by the application under Section 
11(B) (i.e. the examination by any third party interested), overall examination 
by an expert technically qualified as examiner under Section 12,  the 
consideration of the examiner‟s report by the Controller under Section 14, the 
disposal of the pre -grant opposition to the plaintiff‟s application for grant of 
patent by any person in terms of Section 25(1), a full blown  post grant 
opposition under Se ction 25(2) and the final grant of patent upon an overall 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 33 of 57 
 holistic view under Section 43.  It is submitted that the grant of a patent after 
following the procedure involving multi -layered scrutiny must be given 
considerable weight. Unless the defendant is able to discharge the heavy 
burden of showing that it has a stronger prima facie case than the plaintiff, it 
should not be permitted to defeat the right of the plaintiff to an injunction 
against infringement by casually raising a challenge to the validity of such 
patent.  Reliance is placed on the judgment in American Cyanamid Company 
v. Ethicon Ltd . (1975) 1 All. E.R. 504 , Raj Prakash v. Mangat Ram 
Choudhary AIR 1978 Delhi 1 , Proctor v. Bayley 1889 (XLII) Ch.  390, 
Telemecanique  Controls v.  Schnider   94 (20 01) DLT 865 , Hindustan Lever v. 
Lalit Wadhwa  2007 (35) PTC 377 , Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd. v. 
Sudhir Bhatia  (2004 ) 3 SCC 90 , Laxmi Patel v. Chetan Bhat Shah JT 2001 
(10) SC 285 . 
 
50. The judgment of the learned single Judge has been assailed as proc eeding 
on incorrect principles. A separate note has been filed by the plaintiff 
indicating what according to it are errors  in judgment. It sought to be 
contended that even after finding that there was a prima facie case made out by 
the plaintiff, the learn ed single Judge split it into a two -stage test by first 
determining whether the plaintiff had a prima facie case and thereafter whether 
there was a prima facie case made out by the defendant.  It is submitted that 
there is no precedent indicated by the lea rned single Judge for adopting  this 
course.  The judgment is criticized for using a multitude of phrases in deciding 
this issue .  At one place the impugned judgment holds that the case of the 
defendant “is not implausible”, at another place it is stated th at defendant has 
“a credible or arguable challenge to the plaintiff‟s patent” and at another place 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 34 of 57 
 that the defendant has not made “a palpably unfounded claim”.  
 
51. It is contended on behalf of the defendant that under the Patents Act, 1970, 
as contrasted  with the Trade Marks 1999 , there is no presumption of validity of 
a patent. This is evident from reading of Section 13(4) as well as Section s 64 
and 107 of the Act.  It is possible to raise multiple challenges to validity of 
patent at various stages.  It could be at the pre -grant  and post-grant stages 
before the Controller of Patents.  Thereafter before the Appellate Board or in a 
suit for infringement the defendant could question the validity of a patent on 
the grounds set out in Section 64.  The patent in the instant case was, therefore, 
vulnerable to challenge  notwithstanding it surviving the challenge at the pre -
grant stage .  The object behind this was to ensure that known inventions are 
not granted patents and that the patent is used for the public ben efit.   
 
52. The above submissions have been considered. It must be clarified that this 
Court has held already that the Plaintiffs have failed to make out a prima facie 
case. The above submissions of the plaintiffs are therefore being dealt with 
assuming, as the learned Single Judge did, that the Plaintiffs have made out a 
prima facie case. Given the scheme of Patents Act it appears to this Court that 
it does contemplate multiple challenges to the validity of a patent.  Unlike 
Section 31 of the Trade Marks Act which raises a prima facie presumption of 
validity , Section 13(4) of the Patents Act 1970 specifically states that the 
investigations under Section 12 “shall not be deemed in any way to warrant the 
validity of any patent.”   Section 48 of the Act also i s in the form of a negative 
right prevent ing third parties , not having the consent of the patent holder, from 
making, selling or import ing the said product or using the patented process for 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 35 of 57 
 using or offering for sell the product obtained directly by such p rocess. It is 
also made subject to the other provisions of the Act.  This is very different 
from the scheme of the Trade Marks Act as contained in Section 28 thereof.   
Section 3(d ) itself raises several barriers to the grant of a patent particularly in 
the context of pharmaceutical products.  It proceeds on the footing inventions 
are essentially for public benefit and that non -inventions should not pass of f as 
inventions.  The purpose of the legal regime in the area is to ensure that the 
invent ions should b enefit the public at large.  The mere  registration of the 
patent does not guarantee its resistance to subsequent challenges.  The 
challenge can be in the form of a counter claim in a suit on the grounds set out 
in Section 64.  Under Sections 92 and 92 A th e Central Government can step at 
any time by invoking the provision for compulsory licenc ing by way of 
notification.  Therefore, the fact that there is a mechanism to control the 
monopoly of a patent holder (Section 84 and Section 92)  and to control prices  
(by means of the drug price control order) will not protect an invalid grant of 
patent.  
 
53. The plea of the plaintiff that sin ce there is a multi -layered, multi -level 
examination of the opposition to the grant of patent it should accorded the 
highest wei ghtage , is not entirely correct. The contention that there is a heavy 
burden on the defendant to discharge since it has to establish that it has a 
stronger prima facie case of the plaintiff is contra indicated of the decisions in 
the context of Section 13( 4).  Reference may be made to the decisions in 
Biswanath Prasad Radhey Shyam v. M/s Hindustan Metal Industries  AIR 
1982 SC 1444 , Stan dipack Pvt. Ltd.  v. Oswal Trading Co. Ltd.  AIR 2000 Del

 Mahendra v. Jain Glazers  (1979 ) 11 SCC 511 . In BeechamGroup Ltd. v. 
Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd. (1967 -68) 118 CLR 618  and Australian 
Broadcasting Corporation v. O’Neill (2006)229 ALR 457 it was held that t he 
defendant alleging invalidity bears t he onus of establishing that there is “a 
serious question” to be tried on that issue. In Hexal Australai Pty Ltd. v. 
Roche Therapeutics Inc. 66 IPR 325  it was held that where the validity of a 
patent is raised in interlocutory proceedings , “the onus lies on the party 
asserting invalidity  to show that want of validity is a triable question.”  In 
Abbot Laboratories v. Andrx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (decision dated 22nd June 
2006 of the U.S.Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 05 -1433) the Court 
of Appeals f ollowed its earlier ruling in Helifix Ltd. v. Blok -Lok Ltd. 208 F.3d 
1339  where it was held (at 1359): “In resisting a preliminary injunction, 
however, one need not make out a case of actual invalidity. Vulnerability  is 
the issue at the preliminary injunct ion stage, while validity is the issue at trial. 
The showing of a substantial question as to invalidity thus requires less proof 
than the clear and convincing showing necessary to establish invalidity itself.” 
(emphasis supplied) In Erico Int’ll Corprn v. Vutec Corprn (U.S.Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, 2007 -1168) it was held that the “defendant 
must put forth a substantial question of invalidity to show that the claims at 
issue are vulnerable.”  
 
54. In the present case, the grant of a patent to  the plaintiffs for Erlotinib 
Hydrochloride as a mixture of P olymorphs A and B will not ipso facto entitle 
them to an interim injunction if the defendant is able to satisfy the court that 
there is a serious question to be tried as to the validity of the pa tent. The use by 
the learned Single Judge of the expressions “strong credible challenge”, 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 37 of 57 
 “arguable case” or that the defendants claim being  not unfounded, cannot be 
termed as vague and inconsistent since they convey the same meaning in the 
context of the strength of the defendant‟s challenge.  
 
55. The question before this Court is when can it be said that the defendant has 
raised a credible challenge to the validity of a patent held by the plaintiff in an 
infringement action?  During the course of the argu ment it was suggested by 
counsel that the challenge had to be both strong and credible. Also, the 
defendant resisting the grant of injunction by challenging the validity of the 
patent is at this stage required to show that the patent is “vulnerable” and th at 
the challenge raises a “serious substantial question” and a triable issue. 
Without indulging in an exercise in semantics, the Court when faced with a 
prayer for grant of injunction and a corresponding plea of the defendant 
challenging the validity of th e patent itself, must enquire whether the defendant  
has raised a credible challenge.  In other words, that would in the context of 
pharmaceutical products, invite scrutiny of the order granting patent in the 
light of Section 3(d) and the grounds set out in  Section 64 of the Patents Act 
1970. At this stage of course the Court is not expected to examine the 
challenge in any great detail and arrive at a definite finding on the question of 
validity. That will have to await the trial. At the present stage of con sidering 
the grant of an interim injunction, the defendant has to show that the patent that 
has been granted is vulnerable to challenge. Consequently, this Court rejects 
the contentions of the plaintiffs on this issue and affirms the impugned 
judgment of t he learned Single Judge.  
 
Defendant’s challenge to the validity of the patent  
56. The next question is whether the defendants have in fact been able to 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 38 of 57 
 demonstrate that there exist serious triable issues concerning the validity of 
Patent No.196774 grante d to the plaintiffs.  
 
57. The plaintiffs submit that apart from merely challenging the validity of the 
patent granted in their favour, the defendant had not produced any material to 
demonstrate that the compound for which the patent was granted was not a 
novel invention with proved enhanced efficacy over the closest prior art.   
Since the plaintiff s had demonstrated successfully before the Controller of 
Patents that their compound was an inventive step over the closest prior art, the 
burden lay on the defe ndant to show that the inventive step was obvious to a 
person having ordinary skill in the art.  Contrary to the claim of the defendant, 
Erlotinib Hydrocholoride could not be anticipated with reference to the closest 
prior art EP‟226. Methyl and ethynyl gro ups are different and the substitution 
of ethynyl with methyl in the theta position could not have been anticipated 
even by a person skilled in the art with reference to the EP‟226 patent.   
 
58. On the other hand it is contended by the defendant that Section 3(d) of the 
Act introduced in 2005 has made dramatic changes to the patent law regime, 
particularly, in the context of drugs and medicines. Unless the drug or 
compound is proved to be of enhanced efficacy and is an in ventive step, the 
patent is not gra nted. Where the compound is a new form of a known 
substance  (evergreening) , unless it is shown to demonstrate enhanced efficacy, 
the mere discovery of a new property or a new use would not entitle the 
applicant for the grant of a patent.  The derivatives o f the known substances 
would also be considered as the same substances unless they differ 
significantly in properties with regard to the efficacy.   
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 39 of 57 
 59. It is further submitted by the defendant that a perusal of the order dated 4th 
July 2007 of the Control ler of Patents shows that the Controller confused the 
concepts of inventive step, anticipation and obviousness. Even as regards the 
question of efficacy the plaintiffs failed to produce relevant data. The journals 
referred to in the order of the Controller  pertained to results of the research 
conducted by or sponsored by OSI itself. Such studies could not, therefore, 
have inspired credibility as regards the proof of enhanced efficacy of the 
product over the closest prior art.  Irrespective of the above subm issions, the 
defendant submits that the product claimed to be a combination of polymorphs 
A and B was clearly anticipated by the closest prior art, EP‟226 . It was also 
anticipated in the earlier patents granted by the EU. It is submitted that the 
claimed invention was neither novel nor an inventive step over the closest prior 
art. 
 
60.  The above submissions have been considered. It is not possible to accept 
the contention of the plaintiff s that the Section 3(d) does not bring any 
significant change to the Patents Act.  Not only has the substantive portion of 
Section 3(d) indicated a change in 2005 but the Explanation which has been 
added appears to particularly target pharmaceutical products.  It discourages 
evergreening and  prevents such derivative or othe r forms of the already 
patented product being granted patent unless the derivatives or other form s 
“differ significantly in properties in regard to efficacy.” The plaintiff s contest 
the argument that Erlotinib Hydrochloride is a derivative of a known subst ance 
EP‟226 .  However, it appears that the closest prior art does teach the 
compound for which patent has been granted to the plaintiffs. Therefore, unless 
the enhanced efficacy as mandated by Section 3(d) was demonstrate d, patent 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 40 of 57 
 could not have been grant ed.  The defendant has been able to show that order 
of the Controller of Patents was arguably deficient on this aspect . The 
defendant therefore must be taken to have raised a credible challenge to the 
validity of the patent.  
 
61. Elaborate arguments have b een addressed on whether Erlotinib 
Hydrochloride was only a modified form of Gefitinib.  The order of the Patent 
Controller refer s to EP „226 which was relied upon by the defendant to suggest 
that the molecule structure of the suit patent was similar to tho se disclosed in 
the aforementioned patent.   In other words, it was contended by the defendant 
that the substitution of Methyl with Ethynyl would be obvious to a person 
skilled in the art when the closest prior art is taken to be Gefitinib which was 
claimed  in EP „226.  It is sought to be contended by the plaintiff s on the other 
hand that Erlotnib Hydrochloride was a derivative of another disclosed 
compound / structure ( Example 51) and not Gefitinib.  It is submitted that the 
defendant should not be permitte d by a device of reverse engineering to claim 
that the substitution of Methyl by Ethynyl was obvious.   
 
62.  In Pfizer v. Apo tex (U.S.Court of Appeal, 2006 -1261) , it was held that for 
the test of obviousness only a reasonable expectation of success and no t a 
guarantee is needed. In  Aventis v. Lupin  (U.S.Court of Appeal, 2006 -1530) it 
was held that “where the prior art gives the reason or motivation to make the 
claimed compositions, creates a prima facie case of obviousness.”  
 
63. According to the defendant  with reference to the patent held by the plaintiff 
for Erlotinib Hydrochloride as a combination of Polymorph s A and B, the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 41 of 57 
 closest prior art is a molecule structure disclosed in EP „226 which was the 
patent granted to Zeneca Limited.  The Patent Controlle r ought to have 
examined EP „226 when examining the claim of the plaintiff.  According to the 
defendant the closest prior art EP „226 patent disclose d a molecule structure in 
a Quinazoline derivative with Methyl group at the third position.  It is stated 
that such substitution is obvious to persons skilled in the art and that persons 
wish ing to obtain further compounds having anti -cancer properties would have 
been easily motivated to substitute methyl with the specifically disclosed 
ethynyl group.  It is st ated that methyl and ethynyl are normally used 
interchangeably in chemical arts because they share common attributes.  
 
64. The plaintiff s on the other hand ha ve elaborately argued on the “teaching, 
suggestion and the motivation to try”  (TSM) test and subm itted that the 
inventive step in the patent granted to it is in providing a compound which 
shows improved efficacy in its treatment of various cancers.  The state of art 
on the priority date of the patent was Gefitinib. The inventive step in the patent 
goes beyond the state of art as demonstrated by the published articles in the 
journals.  It was argued that FDA and the Drug Regulator of the concerned 
European agency directed withdrawal of the alleged prior art Gefitinib.  In fact 
even Astrazeneca agreed to  the same.  It also did not object, in any region of 
the world, to the plaintiff being granted patent for Erlotinib  Hydrochloride .  It 
is urged that the obvious inf erence was that Erlotinib Hydrochloride was far 
better in enhanced efficacy than Gefitinib.  It is therefore urged that a person of 
ordinary skill in the art would find no motivation at all to replace the methyl 
group at position 3 by a n ethynyl group.  It is further argued that even if a 
person of ordinary skill attempted to modify Example 51 of  EP „226, the 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 42 of 57 
 motivation would be to modify 6 or 7 positions not the third position.  Even if 
such person was motivated to change the substitution in the third position the 
choice would be a halogen such a chlorine and fluorine and not ethynyl.  
 
65. In the  view of this Court, a  bare perusal of the order of the Patent 
Control ler would indicate that neither of the  above arguments ha s been 
considered , and in any event not in the detailed manner in which they have 
been advanced before this Court .  It is perfect ly possible that the Controller 
had no occasion to consider such argument as it was not raised before  him.  
That is perhaps the very purpose of the legislature permit ting a challenge by a 
defendant to the validity of a patent in answer to an infringement s uit, even if 
such defendant had not earlier raised an opposition either at pre -grant or the 
post-grant stage s. Therefore a patent which survive s the pre -grant and post -
grant challenges can still be made vulnerable on grounds different from the 
ones raised at those stages.  The fact that the challenge  is on ground s not urged 
at those stages , would lend credibility to the challenge.  If the challenge is on 
the same ground s considered and rejected by the Controller  of Patents , then of 
course, the burden on the defendant to demonstrate credibility of the challenge 
would be considerably higher degree.  
 
66. There are other factors pointed out by the defendant to render the patent 
vulnerable to challenge. It is submitted that the Controller of Patents has 
confused t he tests of inventiveness with obviousness.   For instance it is 
observed by the Controller that “sometimes the modification in the prior art 
technologies which appear to be minor may bring great revolutions in the 
world which could never be predicted by th e society of intellectuals ……..” 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 43 of 57 
 This, it is pointed out , is really about „anticipation‟ and not „obviousness‟.  It 
was not enough for the plaintiffs to show that the defendant was unable to 
„anticipate‟ the product in question by starting from the closest  prior art 
EP‟226. The plaintiffs had still to show that it would not have been obvious to 
the person having ordinary skill in the art. Reliance is placed on the decisions 
in Shire Biochem v. Ministry of Health  2008 FC 538  to underscore the 
difference betw een novelty and obviousness. The difference between 
anticipation and obviousness is brought out in the decisions Synthon BV v. 
Smith  Kline Beecham  [2005 ] UK HL 59  and KSR International Company v. 
Teleflex  550 US 1 ( 2007) . 
 
67. The decision in KSR Internati onal makes a conscious departure from the 
rigidity in the application of the TSM  test applied to determine if the invention 
in question is patentable. It was observed therein  (550 US 1 at 15) : “The 
obviousness analysis cannot be confined to a formalistic c onception of the 
words teaching, suggestion and motivation or by overemphasis on the 
importance of published articles and the explicit content of issued patents..….  
granting patent protection to advance s that would occur in the ordinary course, 
without rea l innovation retard s progress and may , in the case of patent s 
combining previously known elements , deprive prior inventions of their value 
or utility.”  
 
68. The criticism by the defendant of the order of the Controller of Patents is, 
in the view of this Co urt, not without merit. The Controller failed to appreciate 
that the patent was claimed  specifically on Example 20 and therefore stood on 
a footing different from that granted to the plaintiff s in other countries. The 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 44 of 57 
 point about the credibility of the art icles published in the journals being the 
product of researched sponsored by Plaintiff No.2 OSI was not even noticed by 
the Controller of Patents. The entire discussion on the aspect of enhanced 
efficacy in the order of the Controller is limited to a menti on of these articles. 
Also, in the order dated 4th July 2007 of the Controller of Patents there is an 
incomplete sentence when there is a reference to the decided cases.  The 
anomaly of the pre -grant opposition being disposed of only on 4th July 2007 
where as the patent certificate is of 23rd February 2007 remains unexplained.  If 
it was indeed a pre -grant opposition that was being rejected, it is conceivable 
that the certificate would pre -date it.  
 
69. Elaborate arguments were addressed on the question of b alance of 
convenience on the ground that the judgment of the House of Lords in 
American Cy anamid  requires such factor to be considered once it is shown 
that the damages would not provide an adequate remedy to the plaintiff in the 
event of it succeeding at the trial. In the considered view of this Court, this 
aspect need not be examined in the present case for more than one reason. 
First, the plaintiffs have, for the reasons discussed earlier, failed to make out a 
prima facie case in their favour. Even if it  is assumed that they have, in view of 
the fact that the defendant has raised a credible challenge that renders the 
patent‟s validity vulnerable, the question of balance of convenience does not 
arise because clearly the Court will not, at the interlocutory  stage without the 
case going to trial, come to the aid of a holder of a patent of doubtful validity 
seeking to enforce such patent.  
 
70. One submission of Dr. Singhvi that needs to be dealt with at this stage is 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 45 of 57 
 whether the statements made by an applican t for a patent in the applications 
made by such applicant in other countries would be permitted to be looked into 
by the Controller of Patents while examining such application. Reference was 
made to the decision in T.I. Group Automotive System v. V.D. Nort h America 
375 F 3 d 1126  and the decision dated 2nd August 2006 of the Court of Appeals 
in Pfizer v. Ranbaxy  (06-1179 ).  This Court is unable to accept the above 
submission.  A perusal of the definition of “new invention” in Section 2(1) (l) 
indicates that the invention or technicality for which a patent is sought should 
not have been anticipated “by publication in any document or used in the 
country or elsewhere in the world  before the date of filing of a patent 
application with complete subscriptions, i.e, , the subject matter is not filed in 
public domain so that it does not form part of the state of the art”.  The phrase 
“public domain” and “state of the art” have therefore to admit of a wide scope 
given the legislative intent in introducing the above defi nition by the 
Amendment Act, 2005. It appears that this was introduced in 
acknowledgement of the fact that a claim by an applicant for a patent anywhere 
in the world and the statements made therein would be relevant for the 
authority in India determining whether the invention claimed is indeed a new 
invention. With the easy availability of information on the internet, it is 
possible for the patents authorities in this country to ascertain what in fact is 
the closest prior art  and which is a known substance . A statement made by the 
applicant while prosecuting a patent application in any country would certainly 
be a relevant material to be considered.  The decisions cited by learned counsel 
are not relevant in this context as the law in this country is governe d by the 
Patents Act 1970  which requires the applicant to make a full disclosure as 
noticed hereinbefore.  
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 46 of 57 
 71. The discussion on this aspect is concluded by concurring with the learned 
Single Judge that, assuming that the plaintiffs held a patent for the p roduct 
which was the subject matter of the suit for infringement, the defendant has 
raised a credible challenge to the validity of the patent by raising a serious 
triable and substantial question that renders it vulnerable to challenge.  
 
Public Interest  
72. That brings us to the last submission of the plaintiffs which is that the 
learned Single Judge had applied principles not known to law in refusing 
injunction.  The issues of public interest and pricing were not germane or 
relevant in the context of pate nt law. Public interest on the other hand 
required protecting a validly granted patent. The question of availability of 
the drug at affordable price was provided for in the Patents Act, 1970 by 
way of provisions for compulsory licencing.  Since the legisla tive intent 
was to grant a monopoly to the patent holder for at least the first three years 
after the grant of patent to enable it to recover the enormous costs incurred 
in research and development of the product, the court should not override 
such legisla tive intent on the basis of untested principles. The argument of 
the plaintiff is that if the rights of a patentee are not respected then it would 
be contrary to the public interest of encouraging further research.  Further it 
would discourage the requirem ent of disclosure which inheres in patent 
regime thereby creating a situation where opportunity of further innovation 
based on fundamental research on an existing patent product/process would 
be lost or unduly deferred.   
 
73. An attack was also mounted on  the impugned order of the learned single 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 47 of 57 
 Judge for linking up the issue of pricing with public interest.  It is submitted  
since the Act provide s for grant of compulsory licence in the event of the 
patented product not being made available at the reasonabl e price , it was not 
for the Court to apply such principles at an anterior interlocutory stage.  The 
legislature has for good  reasons granted a statutory monopoly to a patent, 
although for a limited  period. The grant of such limited monopoly must 
therefore also be taken to be in the public interest.  It is submitted that the 
patentee has the right to exploit the benefits of its research in which it has 
invested considerable sums.  By contrast, a gene ric drug manufacturer has little 
or no research and develop ment c osts. Therefore as a rule the copier would 
always price its products lower than the inventor.     
 
74. T he plaintiffs contend that the provisions of the Essential Commodities 
Act, 1953  (ECA)  will apply to pharmaceutical drugs as well. It is submitted  
that the Central Governm ent can also take recourse to the device of a Drug 
Price Control Order (DPCO) framed under Section 3  ECA to fix the market 
sale price in respect of bulk drugs both for scheduled as well as non -scheduled 
formulations.  It is accordin gly submitted that the judgment of the US Supreme 
Court in E Bay v. M erExchange [547 US 338 (2006)]  has to be understood  in 
the context of there being no provision under the Am erican law either for 
granting any right to the Government to control the prices in the manner 
indicated, or a power under Section 47 of the Patents Act, 1970 to grant patents 
subject to conditions including use of the process by the government or even a 
pre-grant opposition  akin to Section 25(1)  of the Act.  It is submitted that 
publi c interest in low cost general drugs has to be balanced by the public 
interest in protection of patent rights and that the need to encourage scientific 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 48 of 57 
 research in discovering the drug outweighs the public interest in obtaining a 
low cost generic drug. Rel iance is placed on the judgment of the District Court 
of the US in Eisai Co. v. Teva Pharamaceuticals  [dated 28.3.2008/Civ. No.05 -
5727 (HAA) (ES) ], Payless Shoesource Inc. v. Reebok International Ltd. 
(998 F.2d 985 ) and Sanofi – Synthela bo v. Apotex (470 F .3d 1368) . 
 
75. The defendant on the other hand counters this submission by submit ting 
that pricing would indeed be a relevant consideration s in determining whether 
the grant of an injunction would adversely affect the easy availability of a life 
saving drug. Reliance is placed on the decisions in Novartis AG v. Mehar 
Pharma 2005 (30) PTC 160(Bom.) ,Franz Xaver Huemer v. New Yash 
EngineersAIR 1997 Del 79  and Russel Uclaf  v. G.D.Searle (1977) Fleet 
Street Patent Law Reports 125 .  
 
76. This court is unable to accept th e submission s of the plaintiffs on this 
aspect . The amendment to the Patent Act 1970 in 2005 introduced Section 
83(e) which states that among the general principles applicable to the working 
of patented inventions regard shall be had “that patents  granted do not in any 
way prohibit Central Government in taking measures to promote public health” 
and under Section 83 (g) “that patents are granted to make the benefit of the 
patented invention available at reasonably affordable prices to the public.”  
Under Section 84 among the grounds on which a person can seek a compulsory 
licence on a patent is that “the patented invention is not available to the public 
at reasonably affordable price.” The element of public interest is therefore not 
alien to the schem e of the Patents Act 1970.  
 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 49 of 57 
 77. The approach of the learned Single Judge was not inconsistent with the 
judicial decisions on this aspect. In Franz Xaver Heumer in the context of 
balance of convenience it was observed (AIR, p. 87):  
 “33. Balance of conveni ence has also an important role to play. 
Stultification of defendants investment, loss of employment, public 
interest in the product (such a life saving drug), product quality coupled 
with price, or the defendant being smaller in size, may go against the 
plaintiff. ” 
 
78. In Novartis AG  the Bombay High Court was considering a case where the 
defendant challenged the grant in favour of the plaintiff of exclusive marketing 
rights (EMR) in respect of a drug Imatinib o n the ground of lack of novelty. In 
refusing injunction to the plaintiff it was observed (PTC, pp.173 -174) 
 “28. A comparison of what is stated in the application submitted 
by plaintiffs in Canada for the patent in 1993 and the contents of 
paragraph 10, in my opinion, definitely raises a serious ques tion 
as to whether the product in relation to which EMR has been 
granted is really a new product or not. In paragraph 8 of the plaint, 
the plaintiffs describe the invention as B crystalline form of 
Imatinib Mesylate. In paragraph 10, the plaintiffs admit t hat 
Imatinib Mesylate crystals were found to be in two forms - Alpha 
(a) and Beta (B). Alpha was needle shaped. Beta was found to be 
thermodynamically stable and was prepared for use in 
pharmaceutical preparations. Perusal of the application submitted 
by the plaintiffs in 1993 for patent in Canada shows that the 
plaintiffs have disclosed the compound as well as its salt. Beta 
crystals are clearly disclosed in the application. Therefore, in my 
opinion, apart from other challenges, this challenge can definite ly 
be said to be serious insofar as the validity of EMR granted is 
concerned and if that be so, in terms of the law that appears to be 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 50 of 57 
 settled referred to above, the EMR being of recent origin, the 
plaintiffs would not be entitled to the temporary injuncti on sought. 
It is further to be seen here that in the present case, it cannot be 
said that even if the plaintiffs ultimately succeed, the loss or injury 
that may be caused to the plaintiffs is not incapable of being 
compensated in terms of money. Indeed, in  the plaint, the 
plaintiffs have worked out loss suffered by them and have in fact 
sought a monetary decree in relation thereto. In my opinion, the 
aspect of balance of convenience has also to be answered in 
favour of the defendants, especially because the  drug in 
relation to which EMR is granted is a anti -cancer drug, is a 
life saving drug and the plaintiffs do not manufacture the 
drug in India but import it from foreign country . The 
defendants have stated that the demand of capsules is over 
30,00,000 per month. This does not appear to have been disputed 
by the plaintiffs. It is clear that the demand of this drug in India is 
very large, it is a life saving drug. The defendants manufacture the 
drug in India. The plaintiffs do not manufacture the drug in Indi a. 
They state that they will import required quantity of the drug from 
a foreign country. Therefore, the plaintiffs will rely entirely on the 
international transport system for making the drug available in 
India in required quantity. In case interim injunc tion is granted 
in favour of the plaintiffs, the manufacturing and marketing 
network of the defendants so far as the drug is concerned 
would be dismantled. If due to any problem, the plaintiffs 
cannot make available the drug in required quantity in India, 
it obviously will be disastrous for the patients . This 
consequence is foreseeable, therefore in my opinion, the Court 
should not pass any interim order which may possibly lead to such 
a situation. In my opinion, the aspect of the difference in price of 
the product of the plaintiffs and the defendants also cannot be 
ignored, especially at the stage of considering the question 
whether the plaintiffs are entitled to any interim relief.”  
 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 51 of 57 
 79. In Roussel Uclaf  the plaintiffs were a company which held a licence u nder 
a patent which  gave them exclusive right s to sell in the United Kingdom two 
drugs, an amide base and a phosphate salt, both giving rise to the same active 
ingredient in the body. The first defendants began to sell the phosphatic salt in 
July 1976 and the plaintiffs sought, inter alia , an interlocutory injunction to 
restrain the sale. The plaintiff‟s sale of the amide base represented 2.2 per cent 
of their total U.K. sales. They did not market the phosphate salt though they 
had plans to do so . In certai n cases of heart disease the drugs could be life -
saving and on other drugs were directly comparable.  The High Court while 
refusing injunction dwelt on the aspect of the drug being a life saving one. It 
was noticed that there was no other drug available wh ich was comparable with 
the drug in question and ha d the same effect.  It was held this aspect and the 
fact that patients suffering from heart disease may easily be suspicious of a 
new drug and be adversely affected by having to change from one drug to 
another had to be “ taken into account when considering the balance of 
convenience and whether in all the circumstances the discretion of the court 
should be exercised to grant an injunction.”  On the aspect of availability of a 
life saving drug it was held:  
 “Finally, therefore, I come to the interesting and, I think novel 
point as to whether this court ought ever and, in particular, in this 
case to exercise its discretion to grant an injunction the effect of 
which will be, temporarily at any rate, to deprive me mbers of the 
public of the benefit of a `life -saving drug which may be 
prescribed‟ for otherwise fatal heart diseases. In fairness to Mr. 
Aldous and the plaintiffs, I should say that it was made clear that 
if the proper conclusion  was that this drug in qu estion was unique 
they would not feel it right to contend that an injunction should be 
granted in such a case. It would, of course, be simple, subject to 
the practical difficulties of distribution, which could probably be 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 52 of 57 
 got over, to make a limited injunc tion ensuring that patients 
already on the drug in question continued to be supplied with it. I 
do not think, however, that such a limitation can deal with the real 
point, which is whether members of the public, whether they are 
already patients on the dru g or not, should be deprived of the 
benefit of it. I think this must be a question for decision in the 
particular circumstances of each case, though I feel that the onus 
in such cases must be very heavily on the plaintiffs to show that 
there is little, if any, likelihood of the public being injured by their 
inability to obtain the drug in question when necessary. A life -
saving drug is in an exceptional position. There are often cases 
where a number of drugs exist alongside each other and are in 
general all equally efficacious for a particular ailment or disease. 
If the evidence shows it to be the fact that there may well be cases 
where it would make little, if any, difference to the public, apart 
from satisfying personal preference, whether a particular drug  was 
no longer available or not, then in such a case it may well be 
proper to grant an injunction. At the other end of the scale, 
however, there is the unique life -saving drug where, in my 
judgment, it is at least very doubtful if the court in its discreti on 
ever ought to grant an injunction and I cannot at present think of 
any circumstances where it should. There are infinite variation 
between these two limits. The present case is very near to the 
unique end, because the soluble salt has at present   no pr ecise 
equivalent, the base not having, on the evidence, the same 
biological activity even though  the active disopyramide once in 
the blood will have the same effect, other things being equal, in 
both cases. To add to this, there is uncontradicted evidence  that 
heart patients are peculiarly sensitive to and fearful of changes in 
drugs and their regime.”  
 
80. Turning to the case on hand, t here is no doubt that the product in question 
is a drug for cancer treatment at the terminal stages.  It is the second li ne 
treatment after the first line of treatment by way of chemotherapy had proved 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 53 of 57 
 unsuccessful. It is expected to be directed of a particular form of non -small cell 
lung cancer. This drug is not readily available in India.  The plaintiffs do not 
yet manufac ture it in India.  They import and sell the drug.  Even if the price 
per tablet is taken to be Rs.3200 as claimed by the plaintiffs it is a drug which 
is expensive.  It is clearly beyond the reach of many patients suffering from 
this dreaded form of cancer . 
 
81. This Court is inclined to concur with the learned single Judge that in a 
country like India where question of general public access to life saving drugs 
assumes great significance, the adverse impact on such access which the grant 
of injunction in a  case like the instant one is likely to have, would have to be 
accounted for.  Erlocip is the Indian equivalent produced by the defendant in 
India as a generic drug manufacturer.  It is priced at Rs.1600 per tablet.  Even 
if this does not make it inexpensi ve, the question of greater availability of such 
drug in the market assumes significance.  
 
82. In the considered view of this Court, while it may be possible to distinguish 
the judgment of the US Supreme Court in E Bay as relating to a case of 
permanent a nd not temporary injunction, the traditional four factor test 
identified in the said judgment does assume relevance even at the stage of 
grant of an interim injunction.  Given the nature of the drug, in the instant case, 
which admittedly is a life saving on e, the fourth test identified in E Bay that 
the grant of an injunction should not result  in the public interest being 
“disserved” would be relevant.  
 
83. The judgments relied upon by the plaintiffs underscore the approach  of 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 54 of 57 
 determining these questions on a case by case basis. Whether indeed  the public 
interest in the availability of the drug to the public at large is outweighed by 
the need to encourage research in the invention, would obviously differ from 
case to case and depend on a host of factors.  This Court finds no ground to 
differ with the reasoning or the conclusions arrived at by the learned Single 
Judge on this aspect after an analysis of all the relevant factors.  
 
84. Even while considering this aspect, the Court is conscious that the 
defendant has been able to demonstrate prima facie that the p laintiffs do not 
hold a patent yet for the drug Tarceva, which is the Polymorph B form of the 
substance for which they hold a patent. Secondly, the defendant has raised a 
credible challenge to the validity  of the patent held by the plaintiffs. In such 
circumstances, th e public interest in greater public access to a life saving drug 
will have to outweigh  the public interest in granting an injunction to the patent 
holder.   
 
Summary of conclusions  
85. To summ arise our conclusions:  
 (i)  The failure by the plaintiffs to bring the facts concerning the filing of 
the subsequent applications for grant of a patent in respect of the 
Polypmorph B form of the compound to the notice of the Controller of 
Patents at the t ime of consideration of their application for patent for the 
compound of a combination of Polymorphs A and B was not consistent 
with the requirement of a full disclosure.  
 (ii) T he change in the stand of the plaintiffs that the earlier patent 
U.S.‟498 (in respect of a mixture of Polymorphs A and B) did not 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 55 of 57 
 disclose Polymorph B free of Polymorph A by stating that it covered all 
known and unknown forms of the compound, would admittedly have a 
direct impact on the question of patentability of either a compound  of 
Polymorphs A and B or of Polymorph B free of Polymorph A. This 
made the full disclosure by the plaintiffs of all the facts pertaining not 
only to the „umbrella‟ compound but the crystal or other forms of the 
product to the Controller of Patents imperat ive. Such disclosure would 
have impacted the decision on the patentability of compound of 
Polymorphs A and B. When the defendant therefore questioned the 
validity of Patent No.196774 on the above ground, it did raise a more 
than credible challenge . 
 (iii) In an application seeking ad interim injunction in a suit for 
infringement of patent, it would be incumbent on the plaintiffs to make a 
full disclosure of the complete specification of the product whose patent 
is claimed to have been infringed.  The plaint iffs will also have to 
disclose to Court the x -ray diffraction data of the product, particularly if 
it is a pharmaceutical drug. The plaintiffs have to make an unequivocal 
disclosure that the patent they hold covers the drug in question; whether 
there are any other pending applications seeking the grant of patent in 
respect of any derivatives or forms of the product for which they already 
hold a patent and the effect of such applications on the suit patent.  
 
(iv) The failure by the plaintiffs to disclose t he complete specification of 
the product and the facts concerning the pending applications for 
Polymorph B led to the learned Single Judge not having the occasion to 
consider if in fact  the suit patent covered Tarceva. H ad these facts fully 
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 56 of 57 
 disclosed in th e plaint and the entire specification of the patent held by 
the plaintiff together with X -ray diffraction data of Tarceva and Erlocip 
filed along with the plaint, it is possible that the plaintiff may have had 
difficulty in showing that the patent held by it (No.196774) covered 
Tarceva as well.   
(v) T o the extent that the defendant has raised a serious doubt whether 
the plaintiffs in fact hold a patent for the product sold in the tablet form 
as Tarceva, the plaintiffs must be held not to have been able to cross the 
first hurdle of showing that they have a prima facie case in their favour 
for grant of an order restraining the defendant from marketing Erlocip . 
The plaintiffs therefore ought to have been refused injunction for their 
failure to make out a prima  facie case . 
(vi) Notwithstanding the above, assuming that the plaintiffs held a patent 
for the product which was the subject matter of the suit for infringement , 
the grant of such patent to the plaintiffs will not ipso facto entitle them 
to an interim inj unction if the defendant is able to satisfy the court that 
there is a serious question to be tried as to the validity of the patent. In 
the present case, the defendant has raised a credible challenge to the 
validity of the patent by raising a serious triab le and substantial question 
that renders it vulnerable to challenge . 
(vii) The  question of general public access in our country to life saving 
drugs assumes great significance  and the adverse impact on such access 
which the grant of injunction in a case li ke the instant one is likely to 
have, would have to be accounted for . This Court finds no ground to 
differ with the reasoning or the conclusions arrived at by the learned 
Single Judge on this aspect .  
          2000:DHC:2-DBFAO (O.S.) No. 188 /2008                                                                                                                          Page 57 of 57 
 (viii) T he defendant has been able to demonstrate prima  facie that the 
plaintiffs do not hold a patent yet for the drug Tarceva, which is the 
Polymorph B form of the substance for which they hold a patent. 
Secondly, the defendant has raised a credible challenge to the validity of 
the patent held by the plainti ffs. In such circumstances, the public 
interest in greater public access to a life saving drug will have to 
outweigh the public interest in granting an injunction to the plaintiffs . 
 
86. For all the aforementioned reasons this Court does not find merit in any of 
the submissions made on behalf of the appellant. It is however made clear that 
this order will not influence the decision of the learned Single judge in the 
pending application IA No.1402 of 2008 and the counter -claim of the 
defendant in the aforeme ntioned suit.                                  
 
 
87. The appeal is dismissed with costs quantified at Rs.5 lakhs which will be 
paid by the appellants/plaintiffs to the defendant within a period of four weeks. 
The interim order stands vacated. The applicati ons are disposed of accordingly.

VALMIKI J.MEHTA, J   
  
I.A.No.__________/2000 in CS(OS) No. 2 150/2000  
1. This application contains the objections under Sections 30 and 33 of the 
Arbitration Act, 1940 on behalf of the respondent to the Award of the sole 
Arbitrator dated 23.8.2000.  This application is not numbered.  Let this 
application be numbered by the registry.  
2. The only objection which has been urged by counsel for the objector to 
the Award , is with respect to th e finding s on issue no.5 , whereby the respondent 
has been directed to refund the minimum guarantee charges for the period for 
                2000:DHC:1CS(OS) 2150/2000   Page 2  
 which the objector did not supply the electricity to the petitioner  on account of a 
fire in the premises of the petitioner . 
3. The counsel for the objector has contended that the Award is liable to be 
set aside because neither of the conditions mentioned  in clause 15 (b)  read with 
clause  5 of the agreement between the parties apply to the fact s of the case and 
it is only on  finding  the existence of the causes as mentioned in these clauses 
that the  claim of  minimum guarantee charges can be suspended.  What is in fact 
argued is that when electricity cannot be supplied for reasons beyond the control 
of the objector, only in such cases,  there is a proportionate reduction of the 
minimum guarantee charges , and not if the objector deliberately disconnects the 
electricity supply . 
4. I am afraid, I am unable to agree with the contentions of the counsel for 
the objector.  No doubt  Clauses 15(b ) and 5 of the Contract pertain  to non - 
charging of minimum guarantee ch arges on account of the inability of the 
objector to supply electricity for reasons beyond his control , however, it is very 
much implicit in these clauses  that if the objector delibera tely refuse s to supply 
electricity  although there is no breach/ fault of the consumer , and in fact 
switches of f the electricity supply from the fee der point , then and (I fail to 
understand as to how  it can be otherwise ) the objector can not continue to claim  
minimum guarantee charges. The concept of  claim towards  minimum guarantee 
charges is predicated on the basis that the objector wants to and is capable of 
supplying electricity , however  either it cannot supply because of reasons 
                2000:DHC:1CS(OS) 2150/2000   Page 3  
 beyond its control or  the consumer does not take  deliberately  the electricity  
supply .  In the facts of the present case, the admit ted position is that the objector 
in fact consciously, deliberately and purposely switched of f  the electricity 
supply.  If that be so, I do not understa nd as to how can the minim um guarantee 
charges be claimed, because it is not that the objector wanted to supply and the 
petitioner did not want to take the supply. The Arbitrator rightly has relied upon  
a Division Bench judgment of this court reported as M/s Matsaya Metal Udyog 
(P)Ltd. vs. MCD  44 (1991) DLT 13  and it s para 22 which is reproduced as 
under: - 
 “22. As regards the minimum guarantee charges it was held in „Bihar 
State Electricity Board, Patna and others v. M/s Green Rubber 
Industries and others‟ , AIR 1990 SC 699, the stipulation to pay 
minimum guaranteed charges, irrespective of whether energy was 
connected or not is not ultra vires.  It will have to be seen as to whether 
the supply was disrupted because of the default of the consumer or of 
the D epartment.  In case the supply was disrupted for any reason or 
default on the part of the consumer then obviously the respondents are 
entitled to minimum guarantee charges.  However, in case it is shown 
that the disruption was because of the respondents an d for no fault of 
the consumers, then obviously the respondents are not entitled to raise a 
bill of even minimum guarantee .  This being a disputed question of fact 
can be raised in arbitration proceedings if the consumers so like.”  
       (Emphasis added)  
  
 It is quite clear from this judgment that once disruption takes place  on 
account  of the objector who supplies electricity, then, it is  not entitled to raise 
the bills o f minimum guarantee . No judgment to the contrary has been brought 
to my notice by co unsel for the objector.   
5. Accordingly, I do not find that the Arbitrator has at all misconducted 
himself or the proceedings . In fact , the Arbitrator has acted in accordance with 
                2000:DHC:1CS(OS) 2150/2000   Page 4  
 law by not allowing the minimum guarantee charges for the period during 
which the objector deliberately failed to supply electricity and in fact  switch ed 
off  the electricity from the feeder point.  
5. The counsel for the petitioner also sought the relief of reduction in the 
rate of interest but when he was asked to point out an y objection taken  to this 
effect  in the objections filed, he fairly conceded that no such objection was 
taken .  Also, t he rate of interest  awarded by the arbitrator is in the facts of the 
case quite reasonable at 12%, and therefore , on merits also, and es pecially in 
view of no objections having been taken, I am not inclined to interfere in the 
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case with regard to the rate  of interest.  I 
may also note that the  objector being a licensee of electricity , and  who 
distrib utes electricity , charges interest varying between 18%  and 24% where 
there is a failure to make payment for the supply of electricity.  
6. The objections are therefore dismissed with costs of Rs.25,000/ -.  Award 
dated 23.8.2000 is made a rule of the Court.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PRADEEP NANDRAJOG  
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA  
 
MUKTA GUPTA , J. (ORAL)  
 
1. Dilshad has been held guilty of murder of Mohd.Akram on the 
strength of statements of eye -witnesses Hazi Hamida r Khan PW-8, 
Mohd.Iqbal PW -11 and Mohd.Arshad PW -12, recovery of knife, the weapon 
of offence at his instance and the post -mortem report corroborating the 
version of the eye -witnesses vide the impugned judgment dated 20th July 20, 
1999.  Vide order dated July  24, 1999, Dilshad has been directed to undergo 
imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of `10,000/ - and in default of 
payment of fine, to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one year.  
2. Dilshad assails the conviction on the ground that the witnesses are 
planted and inimical to him.  There is delay in registration of FIR.  He was 
          1999:DHC:2-DBCRL.A. 412/1999                                                                           Page 2 of 6 
 neither named in the FIR nor arrested at the spot and thus he is entitled to be 
acquitted.  In the  alternative, it is contended that at best even believing the 
prosecution witnesses, the fight took place on the spur of moment and hence 
offence punishable under Section 304 IPC is only made out.  
3. Dilshad had also taken the plea of juvenility claiming t hat he was 
below 16 years of age on the date of alleged incident and thus could  not be 
tried by the Court concerned.  A report was called from the Medical Board 
of the AIIMS which opined the age of Dilshad to be between 40 -45 years on 
the date of examinati on i.e. May  13, 2014.  In light of this opinion of the 
Medical Board, this Court has already held that he was not a juvenile on the 
date of commission of the offence.  
4. The defence of Dilshad is that of denial and false implication.  No 
specific plea has been taken nor any defence evidence led.   
5. Shorn of unnecessary details, the prosecution case is that Inspector 
Bhagwant Singh, SHO, PS Seelampur PW -20 while on patrolling duty at 
Yamuna Pusta near ISBT Road on May 13, 1993 received a wireless 
message t hat an altercation was going on at a place near Jamal Hotel, 
Chauhan Bangar, Delhi. He reached at the spot where ASI Ishwar Singh 
PW-13 along with other police officials had already reached.  They 
informed him that one boy had been stabbed and removed to G TB Hospital 
by ambulance.  SI Amar Nath was posted to guard the spot and Inspector 
Bhagwant Singh went to the hospital.  He obtained the MLC of 
Mohd.Akram  declaring him brought dead .  He met Mohd.Arshad PW -12 in 
the hospital and recorded his statement Ex.P W-12/A on the basis of which 
FIR was registered.  
6. Mohd.Arshad stated that he resided at H.No.5412, Kucha Rehman, 
          1999:DHC:2-DBCRL.A. 412/1999                                                                           Page 3 of 6 
 Town Hall, Delhi and was a student of 12th standard.  His elder brothers 
Mohd.Akram and Mohd.Aslam PW -5 were doing business of embroidery 
and sewing at premises bearing No.C -5/1131, Gali No.7, Chauhan Bangar, 
Delhi u nder the name and style of S.K. Exports and S.K.Fabrications.  They 
reached the factory premises at about 1.00 PM.  ‘S’ a juvenile , who resided 
in their neighbourhood and his associa te, who also resided in the same 
street, were present in the factory premise and were beating their employees.  
Mohd.Imtiaz, the father of ‘S’ was present in the street.  He was having a 
danda in his hands and was hurling filthy abuses.  His brother Akram 
protested saying that in case Imtiaz ha d any complaint against his 
employees, he ought to have brought the matter to his notice.  On this, those 
boys came in the street and alleged that their employee was peeping in their 
house and encroaching upon their p rivacy and they will not leave Akram 
and pounced upon him.  Mohd.Imtiaz attacked Akram with Danda.  He also 
exhorted “Maro Sale Ko”.  On this exhortation, ‘S’ caught hold of his 
brother from his hands and his friend stabbed him in his chest.  Friend of ‘S’ 
was having small moustaches and long hair over his head.  He combed his 
hairs on the back.  His height was about 5’8” and his complexion was 
wheatish.  When he tried to overpower the assailant, he wielded a blow on 
his neck but he turned on one side and s aved himself.  Thereafter, he ran 
away with the help of Imtiaz.  Imtiaz and his son also ran way from there.  
His brother walked upto 4 -5 paces and fell on the ground.  He lifted his 
brother with the help of employee and tr ied to remove him on a scooter bu t 
his brother fell down before boarding it.  He made his brother to board a 
rickshaw however in the meantime police gypsy followed by an  ambulance  
came .  Akram was taken to hospital in the ambulance where Akram was 
          1999:DHC:2-DBCRL.A. 412/1999                                                                           Page 4 of 6 
 declared brought dead.   
7. Post-mortem o f the deceased was got conducted by Dr.N.K.Aggarwal 
PW-4 who exhibited the report vide Ex.PW -4/A.  On external examination 
of the deceased he found one stab wound of 4 x 1.8 cm into cavity deep 
which was present over outer middle back of left side of chest , lower angle 
of the wound was more acute than the upper angle.  The wound had gone 
upwards, inwards lacerating the muscles of sixth and seventh inter costal 
space in the back and then entered the chest cavity in the post auxiliary line 
where it entered th e left lung on the posterior surface of lower wall making a 
stab wound 4.2 x 0.5 cm into lung deep and then went obliquely downwards 
in front and came out from the front of left lung by making an exist of 2.5 x 
.5 cm. The injury was ante -mortem. Cause of d eath was shock as a result of 
haemorrhage produced from injury to left lung.  The above injury was 
sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.  Time since death 
was about 22 hours.   
8. The assailant was later identified to be Dilshad.  Thus Dilshad and 
Mohd.Imtiaz were sent for facing trial. ‘S’faced proceedings before the 
Juvenile Justice Board.  The appellant surrendered before the Court on May 
22, 1993 and thus after permission from the Court he was formally arrested 
and police remand ta ken.  He made a disclosure that he could get the knife 
recovered from a drain at 66 foota road vide Ex.PW -14/A and got the knife 
recovered from there.  During the course of investigation Imtiaz  also got 
recovered the danda.  The appeal of Mohd. Imtiaz  alrea dy stands disposed of 
vide order dated December 17, 2009.  However, since neither the opinion 
was taken from the doctor whether the injury was possible with the said 
knife nor the knife was shown to the witnesses to be the one by which injury 
          1999:DHC:2-DBCRL.A. 412/1999                                                                           Page 5 of 6 
 was caused in  our opinion the recovery of the knife is not connected with the 
injury caused.   
9. Thus the prosecution case rests on the testimony of eye witness PW -
12 Mohd.Arshad and the two other witnesses PW -8 Hazi Hamidar Khan and 
PW-11 Mohd.Iqbal.  Mohd.Arshad had  deposed on the lines of his statement 
on the basis of which FIR was registered.  Nothing has been elicited in the 
cross -examination of Mohd.Arshad.  Hazi Hamidar Khan has also deposed 
that he used to work with Akram as a tailor.  He had one more tailor wi th 
him and the underwear of the said tailor had fallen in the adjoining house of 
Mohd.Imtiaz.  The said tailor was peeping inside the house of Mohd.Imtiaz 
to see whether the underwear had fallen down or not.  In the meantime, 
Mohd.Imtiaz came in the factor y premises and had altercation with the said 
tailor.  He abused and beat the said person.  Thereafter Mohd.Imtiaz left the 
factory.  After some time when Mohd.Akram came and the employees 
informed him.  Mohd.Akram along with 4 -5 employees went to the house  of 
Mohd.Imtiaz and asked him as to why he had beaten his employee and he 
could complain to him if he had any grievance.  In the meantime, 
Mohd.Imtiaz came along with the danda and beat Mohd.Akram.  Crowd 
collected and Dilashad along with the juvenile came  there.  Mohd. Imtiaz 
exhorted Mohd.Akram “ MARO SALEY KOO ” on which Dilshand took out a 
churi used for gutting goats and gave a blow to Mohd.Akram.  Thereafter 
they all ran away.  Even Mohd.Iqbal who had joined the factory as a worker 
has also deposed on t he lines of Mohd.Arshad and Hazi Hamidar Khan.   
10. In view of the testimony of the three eye witnesses duly corroborated 
by the post -mortem report in our opinion the prosecution has proved beyond 
reasonable doubt the offence of stabbing committed by Dils had on 
          1999:DHC:2-DBCRL.A. 412/1999                                                                           Page 6 of 6 
 exhortation of Mohd.Imtiaz.  This brings us to the main question as to 
whether the offence committed by the appellant falls under Section 302 IPC 
or 304 IPC.  From the facts noted above it is amply clearly that Dilshad 
came with no premeditation.  T he verbal altercation took place between 
Mohd.Imtiaz and Mohd.Akram, the deceased due to one of the tailors 
peeping in the house of Mohd.Imtiaz.  Dilshad reached the spot later and on 
exhortation gave single knife blow which proved to be fatal.  However, t he 
single fatal blow was given on the vital part of the body.  Thus the act of 
Dilshad being on the spur of moment theoffence committed by him is 
punishable under Section 304 Part -I IPC.  
11. Consequently, the conviction of Dilshad is altered to one under 
Section 304 Part -I IPC. As per the nominal roll Dilshad has already 
undergone more than 9½ years of imprisonment.  We modify the sentence to 
the period already undergone.  
12. Appeal is disposed of.  
13. The appellant is already on bail.  The bail bond and  the surety bond of 
the appellant stand discharged.  
14. TCR be sent back.

1. This is an appeal again st acquittal filed by the State wherein the 
Respondent after a trial by the learned Special Judge was acquitted for offence 
punishable under Section 161 IPC and Section 5( 1) (d) read with Section 5( 2) 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 2 of 12 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947(in short ‘PC Act’)  in case FIR No. 
33/1987 at  P.S. Anti Corruption Branch, Delhi.   
2. Briefly the prosecution case is that the Complainant PW3, Jaipal Singh 
the Vice President of Yuva Janta Morcha  on 4th December, 1987 lodged a 
complaint Ex. PW3/A with the Anti Corrup tion Branch that during the 
checking of votes from door -to-door by the supervisors of the election office , 
one Girdhari Lal Verma  (Respondent herein)  who was the supervisor of the 
Delhi Cantt area came to his office and told him that he ha d deleted 8 00 votes 
of Naraina area.  The Respondent also dismissed the objections filed by the 
Complainant in respect of jhuggis situated in Kirb y Place, Subroto Park and 
Dhaula Kuan.  When PW3 wanted the electoral rolls to be corrected, the 
Respondent demanded `400/- for every polling booth .  The Respondent also 
told the Complainant that if the complainant filed a claim, he would correct 
the votes deleted by him.  PW3 alleged that even his name has been deleted 
from the list of voters.  On  the complaint of PW3 , PW4 Sh. J. L. Khanna  was 
associated as panch witness and pre -raid formalities by noting the numbers  of 
the four currency notes of `100/- denomination were prepared .  The said notes 
were treated with phenolphthalein powder. Since the appointed place of 
giving the brib e amount was at  Bus stand on Ridge Road near Dhaula kuan, 
the raiding party reached at the spot.  On reaching the appointed place, PW3, 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 3 of 12 the complainant told the raiding officer that he would be going towards old 
secretariat in his vehicle bearing No. DBR  65 and, the transaction would take 
place in the car on the way.   The Maruti Van of PW3 bearing No. DBR 65 
came at about 2: 15 P.M.   PW4, J.L. Khanna sat on the front seat by the side of 
the driver and PW3 and the Respondent on the rear seat.  At about 3:00 P.M.  
the vehicle reached 5, Alipur Road at the office of Delhi Administration and 
from there the Maruti Van went to the office of Food & Supply situated at 
Under Hill Road .  At 3:30 P.M. PW3 told the raiding party that the 
Respondent would be taking the br ibe at Begum Zaidi Market, Moti Bagh 
where the office of Yuva Janta Morcha was situated and they would be 
reaching at the spot about 6:30 P.M.  The raiding party took position at the 
said market.  At about 6:30 P.M. Maruti Van reached the spot where PW3 
again offered money to the Respondent and when PW4 gave the pre-
appointed signal , the raiding party rushed towards the Maruti Van and 
apprehended the Respondent.  `400/- were recovered from the left hand of the 
Respondent.  Numbers of the G.C. notes were tall ied and the left hand wash of 
the Respondent turned pink .  The same were seized and sealed in a glass 
bottle.  T he Respondent was arrested and FIR was registered.  On completion 
of investigation, charge -sheet was filed .  After recording of the prosecution 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 4 of 12 witnesses, statement of the Respondent  was recorded .  The Respondent was 
acquitted vide the impugned judgment dated 20th November, 1997.   
3. Learned APP for the State contends that the date of incident is 4th 
December, 1987 and the Respondent was on leave  on that day. The learned 
trial court while acquitting the Respondent has laid a lot of emphasis on the 
change of place of payment from Dhaula Ku an to Alipur Road to Moti Bagh 
near the office of the Complainant.  The change of place was only an over-
cautio us approach of the Respondent and in no way belied the prosecution 
case.  The trial court failed to appreciate that PW 3 the Complainant was 
cross -examined on the 9th February, 1996 after more than six years and thus 
variations are bound to take place in h is testimony.  In his statement under 
Section 313 Cr.P.C., the Respondent had admitted most of the facts except 
saying that he has been falsely implicated.  The testimony of PW3 , the 
Complainant is corroborated by the testimony of PW4 J.L. Khanna , the panc h 
witness who accompanied PW3 throughout in the van.  The conduct of the 
Respondent becoming nervous on seeing the raiding party is relevant under 
Section 8 of the Evidence Act.  Slight variations in the testimony of PW4 as to 
how the Respondent was holdin g the bribe amount has been clarified in his 
cross -examination by the learned APP .  Moreover the testimony of this 
witness was recorded after nine years of the incident and thus variations are 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 5 of 12 bound to occur in the said testimony.  The contradiction betwee n the 
statements  of PW3 and PW4 as to whether the  post raiding work was done at 
the office of Anti Corruption Branch or on the spot does not go to the root of 
the prosecution case and thus the Respondent could not have been acquitted 
on the said ground. Th e evidence of PW3 and PW4 is further corroborated by 
the testimony of PW7 the raid officer Insp. Abhay Ra m.  The CFSL report Ex. 
PW6/B further corroborates the testimony of the witnesses a s it opine d that 
the solution ga ve positive test for phenolphthalein  and sodium carbonate.  
Referring to a decision of this Court in Sri Chand Gaur vs. CBI Crl. Appeal 
No. 252/2001 it is contended that when witnesses are examined after a long 
time, variations are bound to occur and accused cannot be granted benefit of 
those minor variations  which do not go to the root of the matter.  
4. Per Contra l earned counsel for the Respondent has placed reliance on 
State of Andhra Pradesh vs. S. Swarnlatha & Ors. 2009 (4) C.C.C. (SC) 168  
to contend that in an appeal against acquittal i f two views are possible and the 
view taken by the learned trial court is probable then the Appellate Court will 
not interfere.  It is contended that t he trial of the Respondent was co nducted 
under the P C Act, 1947 where unlike the Act o f 1988 presumption was not 
available.  Thus, the evidence of the prosecution has to be examined in the 
light of these two legal principles.  PW1 Ram Kishan, Food and Civil Supply 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 6 of 12 Officer in his cross -examination has stated that SDM alone was competent to 
uphold the objection  and rectify the list.  Thus, it was not in the competence of 
the Respondent to rectify the list or make additions/alterations to the same. In 
the absence of such a power vested in the Respondent, he could have neither 
demanded the bribe nor would have bee n given the bribe for this work.  PW 3 
the Complainant himself in his examination -in-chief has given the reason for 
false implication  of the Respondent . PW3  has admitted that he was an active 
worker of a political party and his vote has been deleted from t he list of voters 
from the polling booth No. 41.  The conduct of the Respondent declining the 
money after being offered four times is not in consonance with demand and 
acceptance of bribe.  No evidence has been led to show that PW 3 had fil led 
the claim for ms and no such document  supporting the claim  has been 
exhibited.  Only photocopies were placed on record which were not accepted 
and were only marked by the learned Trial Court . Thus , the same cannot be 
read in evidence.  Even, the complaint Ex. PW3/A does  not indicate the date, 
month and the year of initial demand and thus this fact being stated for the 
first time in the examination in chief shows that it was a clear improvement in 
the testimony of P W3. PW3 has been duly confronted on this count. There are  
material impr ovements in the testimony of PW 3 i.e. his having stated that the 
money was to be paid at Ridge Road, Dhaula Kuan and stating in his cross -
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 7 of 12 examination that he does not know which of the worker had filled up the 
claim forms . In regard to the or iginal document , he has stated that the original 
documents must be in the party office and no verification of the claim  form 
has been done by the investigating agency. There are contradictions in the 
testimony of PW4 , the Panch witness also  who has further  stated that the 
money was kept by the respondent in his front pocket which w as recovered by 
the Inspector. Th is witness has further stated that the Seizure memo of the 
papers recovered from accused was also prepared by the Police officials. PW 
4 who was s itting in the front seat has in his cross -examination stated that the 
Respondent did not demand any money at any stage. In the absence of 
demand, no case for conviction under PC Act is made out. There is also 
discrepancy as to the place where the writing w ork i.e. the seizure memo etc. 
were filled and the han d wash of the respondent was taken. PW4 has stated 
that the hand wash was taken at the office of Anti Corruption Branch whereas 
the other witnesses have stated that the same was done at the spot and thu s 
showing total manipulation. This part of the cross -examination has not been 
challenged by the prosecution and no re -examination of the witness has been 
conducted  to clarify on the aspect that where the proceedings t ook place.  All 
the witnesses have admit ted that the Respondent did not make any demand  
throughout and PW3 was clearly instructed to give the money only when the 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 8 of 12 demand was made.  Thus, in the absence of the demand, no money could have 
been paid to the Respondent.  PW7 Inspector Abhey Ram in his  cross -
examination has admitted that he did not seize any objec tions or any 
photocopies thereof  and thus the photocopies of the  said  documents placed on 
record have been planted.   The decision of the trial Court acquitting the 
accused as the prosecution h as failed to prove its case beyond reasonable 
doubt is correct. Thus, there being no illegality or perversity in the impugned 
judgment  the present appeal be dismissed .  
5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and peruse d the record.  
Conscious of t he limitation of interference in an appeal against acquittal, I 
would now proceed to examine the evidence on record and examine whether 
the judgment on the basis of said evidence falls in any of the categories laid 
down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case  of Ganpat vs. State of Haryana, 
2010  (10) SCALE 237  i.e. whether the learned trial court has ignored material 
evidence or material legal aspect.  In case two views are possible, this Court 
will not interfere in this appeal against acquittal.  
6. PW3 Jaipa l Singh is the Complainant of the case .  According to him, 
the Appellant told him to pay `400/- per polling booth and on the 
Complainant giving  fresh objections thereafter  he would set everything right. 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 9 of 12 There were number of polling booths  and number of dis crepancies in the voter 
lists.  In was finally agreed with the Respondent to pay him `400/- only on 4th 
December, 1987 for one polling both.  However, as per the complainant it  was 
not decided for which polling booth this money was to be paid.  The same 
sounds highly improbable .  When the money was agreed to be paid , the 
polling booth for which it was being paid would have also been  decided .  This 
part of the testimony of  PW3  is also not supported by the documents which 
were allegedly given in the form of list and objections.  It has also not been 
proved for which polling booth the same related  to.  There is no doubt that 
during elections, the time available with the political parties  is short  and the 
Complainant would not wait to pay in installments and ge t  the list corrected 
for one polling booth when it is not even decided for which one it is. I do not 
find the testimony of PW3  to be reliable on this count . 
7. The next issue that arises is whether the prosecution has proved the 
demand by the respondent a t the time of trap. PW3 Jaipal Singh was 
accompanied by PW4 , the panch witness and the driver. PW 3 does not 
depose in his testimony that the Respondent demanded money while sitting on 
the rear seat of the car along with him. According to PW 3, he stated to the 
Respondent that he had brought the papers relating to one public booth as also 
the money and requested him to correct the voters list for one polling booth. 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 10 of 12 The Respondent told him that he had some work at his office at 5, Alipur 
Road regarding the t ransfers and that he would do the work first and then 
accept the papers and the money. The Respondent then enquired about PW4 
Mr. Khanna, to which PW 3 replied that PW 4 wante d permit for cement and 
he had to get him  the permit. PW3 again offered money to the Respondent but 
he was reluctant and he took the car to the office of Food & Civil Supply, 
Under Hill Road. PW3 again offered him the money at the Food & Civil 
Supply Office, but the Respondent told him that they had to go to the office at 
Begum Zaidi M arg and he would accept the money there.  On the pretext of 
going to the office of the Civil supplies PW3 and PW4 came out of the car 
and informed PW7 that the Respondent would take money only in Zaidi 
Market.  He also told the Inspector that they would re ach the Market by 
6.30P.M. whereas, the Respondent remained seated in the car. They came 
back and got into the car.  On reaching Begum Zaidi Market , PW3 got down 
and went to the office for 2 -4 minutes while PW4 and the Respondent 
remained seated in the car . PW3 came back. H e again offered the money to 
the Respondent while sitting in the car and gave money and papers. The 
Respondent took the money in his left hand and list in the right hand on which 
PW4 gave the signal to the raiding party. It is thus eviden t that in the entire 
testimony of PW3 it is nowhere stated that the Respondent demanded money. 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 11 of 12 This evidence of PW3 is also corroborate d by PW 4 who also in his testimony 
does not state that the Respondent demanded money rather has stated that at 
no stage money was demanded by the Respondent either initially or at the 
time of trap. Though, it is stated that money was given to the Appellant along 
with the voters list for correction and objections however, no documents have 
been seized from the right hand of the Appellant.   No explanation has been 
offered by the prosecution as to why these papers were not recovered from the 
right hand of the Appellant by the raiding officer.  
8. It is now to be examined that in the absence of any demand,  would  
mere acceptance  of money implicate the Respondent  for offence punishable 
under Section 161 IPC and Section 5(1)  (d) read wit h Section 5(2) of the P C 
Act, specially when the corroboration evidence of post raid proceedings is not 
authentic . Demand is an essential ingredien t for an offence punishable under 
Sections 161 IPC and 5 (1) (d) read with 5 (2) of the PC Act.   Section 4 of the 
PC Act lays down a statutory presumption that in any trial for offence 
punishable under Section 161 of the IPC or 5(1)  (a) or (b) punishable u nder 
Section 5(1) the Court is duty bound to raise a presumption after it is proved 
that an accused person has accepted or obtain or admitted to obtain for himself 
or any other person any gratification or any valuable thing.  This presumption 
is not  availa ble for offence  punishable under Section 5(1)  (d) read with 
                1999:DHC:1Crl. Appeal 90/1999   Page 12 of 12 Section 5(2) of the P C Act.  Hon’ble Supreme Court in Banarsi Dass Vs. 
State of Haryana (2010) SCC 450  has held that to constitute an offence under 
Section 161 IPC & Section 5(1)(d) of the PC Act it is necessary that there is a 
demand of money and the same is accepted for doing a favour. Demand of 
Money is a sine qua non for the conviction of the accused. Thus, in the 
absence of demand and the presumption, the offence punishable under 
Sections 161 and 5(1) (d) read with 5(2) of the PC Act has not been proved 
beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution  in the present case.   
9. In the light of the facts elaborated above, I find that there is neither any 
illegality nor perversity in the view taken by t he learned Trial Court . The 
impugned judgment  does not warrant any interference.  Appeal is dismissed.

 Kumar t he prosecution case in respect of the incident of murder whic h 
took place in the year 1984 may first be noticed. On 9th January, 1984 a 
telephonic  information was given to Vasant Vihar police station at about 
7.10 p.m.by the Chief Security Officer of Hotel Siddharth Interc ontinental 
in Vasant Vihar that some inciden t had taken place in the hotel. That 
information was recorded as DD No.10 -A(Ex.PW -21-A) and then Sub -
Inspector L.N.Rao(PW -27) was hand ed over the  investigation . He reached   
Siddharth Interc ontinental Hotel along  with some other policemen and 
there on comi ng to know that the incident had taken place on 8th floor of 
the hotel they went to 8th floor. There one Anand Kumar(PW -1) informed 
SI Rao that at about 6.45 p.m. he had seen two persons, one of whom was 
armed with a revolver and the other with a knife, dr agging one person who 
was bleeding from his chest and that person was dragged  inside room 
no.802.  Then  SI Rao found the room no.802 closed from inside and after 
lot of effort that room was got opened from inside. As per the prosecution 
case when the door  was opened from inside the two  convicted accused 
Rajneesh Kumar and Rajender Kumar were found present inside the room. 
Rajneesh Kumar was holding a revolver and Rajender Kumar was holding 
a knife in his hand. Both of them were over powered by the police o fficials 
and the weapons which they were holding in their hands were taken into 
police possession sealed and seized vide separate seizure memos. The 
knife recovered from accused Rajender Kumar was found to be blood 
stained. Inside the bath -room of room no.  802 one dead body having stab 
wounds was found . On enquir y the dead body was found to be of that one 
Mr. Harish V. Rao who had come to stay in the hotel. Since the death of 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 3 of 21 
 
 
 Mr. Rao appeared to be homicidal, the investigating officer S.I. L.N. Rao 
prepared  a rukka  and got a case registered at Vasant Vihar Police Station 
under Section s 302/397/34 IPC  and accordingly FIR was registered.   
Separate FIRs under  Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act  were also registered 
against the two accused . The dead body of the dece ased was got subjected 
to  post-mortem examination and the cause of death opined by the a utopsy 
surgeon Dr. Chander Kant (PW-25) was shock , haemorrhage and asphyxia  
because of as many as seven  injuries found on the dead body which 
included three stab injuri es also and the same were found to be sufficient 
to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The autopsy surgeon had 
also opined that three stab injuries found on the dead body of the deceased 
were likely to have been caused by the knife, which as per  the prosecution 
case was recovered from the possession of accused/appellant Rajender 
Kumar. After co mpletion of investigation the deceased accused Rajneesh  
Kumar  and accused/appellant Rajender Kumar were both charge -sheeted 
by the investigating agency for the offences under Sections 
302/392/397/34 IPC. Separate charge -sheets under Sections25/27 of T he 
Arms Act were also filed in Court and  in due course  all the three charge -
sheets  came  to be committed to the  Session s Court and then the cases were 
assigned t o the Court of Additional Sessions Judge for trial.  
4. The learned Additional Sessions Judge  clubbed all the three charge -
sheets since the same arose out of the same incident and then  framed 
charge s under Sections 302/ 34 IPC as well as under Section  394 read with 
Sections 397 and 34  IPC against both the accused persons . Both of them 
were also charged separately for the commission of the offence s 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 4 of 21 
 
 
 punishable under Sections 25/27 of the Arms Act. Since both the accused 
had pleaded not guilty to the aforesaid charges the prosecution was called 
upon by the trial Court to adduce its evidence.  
5.  28 witnesses were then examined by the prosecution. The accused 
while answering questions put to them at the time of recording of their 
statements under Section 313 Cr. P.C. pleaded false implication. The 
deceased accused Rajneesh Kumar did not claim that the amount of Rs. 
2000/ - which the prosecution was claiming to be in the purse recovered 
from him and in which driving licence and visiting cards of the deceased 
were al so there was his own money. Thereafter , the two accused had also 
examin ed one witness each .  
6.  Since there was no eye witness of the murder t he prosecution had 
relied upon c ertain circumstances for establishing the invol vement of two 
accused persons  in the murder of the deceased . The learned Additiona l 
Sessions Judge found all the  circumstances  relied upon by the prosecution  
fully established and vide common judgment dated 30th April, 1994 
disposed of all the three cases and convicted both the accused per sons 
under Sections 302 read with 34 IPC and vide order dated 23rd May, 1994 
sentenced both of them to undergo imprisonment for life and also to pay 
fine of Rs. 1000/ - each, in default of payment of fine they were ordered to 
undergo further rigorous impris onment for a month.  Both the accused 
were also convicted under Sections 392 read with 397 IPC but no sentence 
was a warded on this count.   Accused –appellant Rajinder Kumar was also 
convicted under Section 25 of the Arms Act and sentenced to undergo 
rigoro us imprisonment for six months and also to pay a fine of Rs. 200/ - 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 5 of 21 
 
 
 and to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one month in the event 
of default in payment of fine.   For his conviction under Section 27 of the 
Arms Act he was sentenced to undergo rigo rous imprisonment  for one 
year and also to pay a fine of Rs. 500/ - and to undergo further rigorous 
imprisonment for two months in the event of non -payment of fine.   The 
deceased accu sed Rajneesh was also convicted  under Section 25 of the 
Arms Act and sen tenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year 
and to pay fine of Rs. 500/ - and to undergo further rigorous imprisonment 
for two months in the event of non -payment of fine. Substantive sentences 
of imprisonment were ordered to run concurrently.  
7. On behalf of the surviving accused -appellant Rajinder Kumar his 
counsel Mr. Anurag Jain argued the appeal.  Learned counsel did not 
dispute before us the fact that the deceased Harish V. Rao was murdered 
and his dead body was found lying in the bathroom of r oom no. 802 of 
hotel Siddharth Continental o n the evening of 9th January, 1984. He, 
however, strongly contended  that the  other circumstances  put forth by the 
prosecution for establishing the guilt of the accused persons cannot be said 
to have been establi shed beyond reasonable doubt since there are many 
serious infirmities in the evidence of material prosecution witnesses who 
claimed to have seen the accused persons inside room no. 802 of the hotel 
from where the dead bod y of the deceased was recovered and  as far as 
PW-1, who had allegedly seen the deceased being dragged inside room 
no.802 in injured condition  by the accused  persons ,  is concerned he had 
not supported the prosecution.    
8. On the other hand, Mr. M.N. Dudeja, learned Additional Public 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 6 of 21 
 
 
 Prosec utor appearing for the State fully supported the judgment of the trial 
Court and contended that there are no infirmities whatsoever in the 
prosecution evidence and its analysis done by the learned Additional 
Sessions Judge and there is no scope for any int erference by this Court and 
the conviction of the accused deserves to be sustained.  
9. When a case rests on circumstantial evidence, such evidence must 
satisfy of -quoted following tests viz:  
(1) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to 
be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established;  
 
(2) those circumstances should be of definite tendency unerringly 
pointing towards the guilt of the accused;  
 
(3) the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so 
complete that there is no  escape from the conclusion that within all 
human probabilities the crime was committed by the accused and 
none else; and  
 
(4) the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must 
be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis 
than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not 
only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be 
inconsistent with his innocence.  
 
10. Keeping in mind these well recog nized principles to be followed by 
the Courts while deal ing with a criminal case in which the guilt of the 
accused is sought to be established through circumstantial evidence  we 
shall now proceed to examine the prosecution evidence in respe ct of the  
various circumstances  relied upon by the prosecution. The lea rned 
Additional Public Prosecutor  high-lighted before us  the following 
circumstances which according to him stood established  conclusively and 
which  prove the guilt of the accused :- 
i)  H.V. Rao  (the deceased)  came to Delh i from Bombay on the 
day of the  incident i.e. 9th Jan. 1984 and was staying in room no.802  
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 7 of 21 
 
 
 in Sid dharth Continental  Hotel  in Vasant Vihar, New Delhi.   
 
ii)  At about 6.45  p.m. on the day of the incident PW -1 Anand 
Kumar, a Houseman in the hotel, saw the two accused armed with a 
revolver  and knife dragging the deceased in injured  condition  in the 
corridor of 8th floor of the hotel and taking him inside room no.802.   
 
iii)  On police reaching the hotel around 7 .10 p.m. room no.802 
was got opened from inside and in that room the two accused  were 
found present.   Accused Rajneesh Kumar was found having a blood 
stained revolver in his hand and accused  Rajender Kumar was having 
a blood stained knife in his hand  at that time .  
 
iv)  The dead body of H.V. Rao with stab injuries on different parts  
of the body was found lying in the bath -room of room no.802  
 
v)  From the pocket of accused Rajneesh Kumar one purse of the 
deceased with his driving license and visiting cards was recovered.   
 
vi)  Accused Rajender  Kumar was having  a Seiko watch belon ging 
to the deceased.  
 
vii) The clothes of the both the accused were having blood stains 
and there was blood on the shoes also of accused Rajinder Kumar  
when they were apprehended inside room no.802 of the hotel . 
 
viii) The death of the deceased was homic idal.  
 
ix) The autopsy surgeon  had opined that the stab injuries found on 
the body of the deceased were possible with the knife which accused 
Rajinder Kumar was holding in his hand at the time of his 
apprehension.    
 
x)  The accused had given false expl anation for their presence in 
the hotel in the evening of 9th January,1984.  
 
 11. Regarding circumstance s no. (i) and (iv)  nothing was argued by the 
learned counsel for the appellant Rajinder Kumar and rightly so since th is 
accused - appellant himself  had admitted  during the trial   that the dead 
body of the deceased was found in the bathroom of room no. 802 of hotel 
Siddharth Continental and further that at the time of recovery of dead body 
from there he himself was also present  on the 8th floor of the hote l. The 
witness examined by him in defence(DW -2 Inder Kumar) also deposed 
that on 7th or 8th January,1984  Rajinder Kumar had told him that he would 
be going to Siddharth Continental hotel in a day or two to meet one Maya 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 8 of 21 
 
 
 Rawat for getting a job.  In any even t, the p rosecution had examined PWs 
2, 16 and 17 to prove this circumstance and their evidence also clearly 
establishes  that the deceased had checked in hotel Siddharth Continental 
on 9th January, 1984 around 6 p.m.   PW-2 Chuni Lal during those days 
was e mployed in the said hotel as a bell boy .  He deposed that on 9th 
January, 1984 his duty was on 8th floor of the hotel and that day around 6 
p.m. the deceased accompanied by one person (PW -16) had come there 
and gone inside room no. 802.   After some time t he person accompanying 
the deceased had come out of the room and then he along with that person 
had come down to the lobby on the ground floor.   He further deposed that 
after about one hour Anand Kumar(PW -1), houseman, came to the lobby 
and informed him t hat some incident had taken place on 8th floor an d 
further that at about 11 p.m.  h e(PW -2) was called upon to identify the 
body of the deceased which was lying in the bathroom of room no. 802.   
This witness further deposed that the dead body was of the sa me person 
who had come to s tay in room no. 802 at about 6 p.m.   During his cross -
examination his statement to the effect that the deceased had come to the 
hotel on 9th January, 1984 around 6 p.m. and had stayed in room no. 802 
was not challenged and the s ame, therefore, stood admitted by the accused.  
PW-17 is Mr. S.K. Gupta, who was employed as a Junior Executive in 
Siddharth Continental hotel.   He deposed that on 9th January, 1984  the 
deceased had come to the hotel at about 5.45 p.m. along with his frie nd 
Mr. Anand(PW -16) and he was sent to room no. 802 with bell boy Chuni 
Lal and after about five minutes that bell boy and Mr. Anand had come 
down while the deceased Mr. Rao had remained in the room.   This 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 9 of 21 
 
 
 witness proved the registration card in respect o f the deceased as Ex. PW -
17/A.   Testimony of this witness also remained unchallenged in cross -
examination on behalf of the accused.  PW -16 is Mr. M.S. Anand who 
deposed that in the year 1984 he was working as a Director of 
Consolidated Machine Pvt. Ltd. h aving its office in Lajpat Nagar, New 
Delhi and that Company was selling agent of CME Industries, Bombay 
and the deceased Mr. H.V. Rao was its Sales Manager.   On 8th April, 1984 
he had received a call from Bombay that he should book a room for Mr. 
Rao for  two days at hotel Siddharth Continental which he did the same 
night .  He further deposed that on 9th January, 1984 Mr. Rao came straight 
to his office at Lajpat Nagar from where they h ad gone to Palam  and at 
about 5.45 p.m. he had dropped Mr. Rao at Siddh arth Continental hotel 
where he was allotted room no. 802.   His testimony to this effect also 
remained unchallenged in his cross -examination on behalf of the accused 
persons.  
12. Similarly the counsel for the appellant Rajinder Kumar did not 
dispute the f act that the deceased died  a homicidal death(circumstance 
no.(x). That circumstance is also even otherwise fully established by the 
evidence of the autopsy surgeon PW -25 Dr. Chander Kant  who had 
conducted post -mortem examination on 10/01/84  and who proved his 
report as Ex.PW -23/A. He deposed about the various ante -mortem injuries 
found by him on the dead body of the deceased including three stab 
injuries on the neck and left side of chest, described as injuries no. 3,6 and 
7 in the report having been caused  by a sharp edged weapon and which 
were found to be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.  
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 10 of 21 
 
 
 The cause of  death, according to PW -25, was ‘shock haemorrage and 
asphyxia’ as a result of the injuries found on the dead body of the 
deceased.  The approximate time since death was opined to be between 15 
to 18 hours. This witness was not cross -examined on any aspect on behalf 
of the accused.   
13. For establishing the most crucial circumstance s no. (ii) , (iii) and 
(vii), which we are taking up to gether, the prosecution had relied upon the 
evidence of  PWs 1 to 4 and the investigating officer PW -27. PW -1 Anand 
Kumar,  was employed as a houseman in hotel Siddharth Continental in the 
year 1984  and he is the complainant of this case as it was on his st atement 
that the police had registered the three FIRs.  He deposed that on 9th 
January, 1984 he was on duty as houseman on the 8th, 9th and 10th floor s of 
the hotel from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m.  At about 7 p.m. he was present on the 9th 
floor when he heard some voice and all of a sudden there was a 
commotion on the 8th floor.   He then immediately went to the 8th floor and 
found people running here and there and he also saw two persons dragging 
one person into room no. 8 02.  Since those two persons were armed he had 
sought the assistance from number of persons to apprehend those two 
persons.   He further deposed that one person who was known to him 
previously by face was present there along with another person at the 8th 
floor and he asked them to keep a watch and  not to let the person with 
arms  escape from there and thereafter he went to the lobby and informed 
Chuni Lal(PW -2) about that incident and told him to inform the security 
staff.   He then returned  to the 8th floor where the two persons whom he 
had told to  keep a watch were present near the door of room no. 802.   He 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 11 of 21 
 
 
 further deposed that the police also arrived there and  thereafter he along 
with Ramanuja n(PW-3) and Sethi (PW-4) and other persons entered room 
no. 802 where dead body of one  seth of Bombay, who  was staying in that 
room, was found lying in the bathroom and nobody else was found present 
in the room at that time.    
14. Since  this witness did not identify the two accused persons to be the 
two persons whom he had seen dragging the deceased inside r oom no. 802 
he was permitted to be cross -exam ined by the Additional Public 
Prosecutor.  During the cross -examination by the prosecutor PW -1 did not 
accept that the two accused persons present in Court were the persons who 
had dragged the deceased inside roo m no. 802 .   When he was confronted 
with his statement  Ex. PW -1/A, based on which FIR of this case was 
registered and which statement he admitted to have made to the police this 
fact was found to be recorded therein. In that  signed  statement PW -1 had 
even mentioned the names of the two accu sed persons as the culprits . PW -
1, however, had claimed that both the accused persons were those two 
persons whom he had asked to keep a watch  outside room no.802 and they 
were  standing  near the door of room n o. 802 when he had returned  from 
the lobby.   He , however,  admitted  that the clothes of the accused were 
blood stained at that time  but he then  clarified  in his cross -examination on 
behalf of  the accused  that their clothes  had got smeared with blood when 
he along wit h the accused  had overturned the dead body of the deceased to 
find out as to what injuries he had sustained.   PW-1 also admitted that a 
drum of the revolver was found lying outside the room.  
15. In respect of the evidence of this witness the learned tria l Court has 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 12 of 21 
 
 
 observed in its judgment that he was deliberately concealing the identity of 
the culprits and that he was deposing falsely to that extent.   After carefully 
examining the evidence of PW -1 we find ourselves in full agreement with 
these observati ons of the learned trial Judge. PW-1 had ad mitted  having 
made the first i nformation  statement  Ex. PW -1/A to the police.  In that 
statement he had clearly claimed before the police that the two accused 
persons had been seen by him dragging the deceased into  room no. 802 
and after some time both of them were found inside room no. 802  when 
the police had the door of the room  opened .   There is nothing on record to 
suggest that the investigating officer PW -27 SI L.N. Rao had forced this 
witness to get such a st atement recorded and we find no reason to 
disbelieve the statement of this investigating officer  made during his 
evidence in Court that such a statement was made before him  by PW -1 
Anand Kumar.  Although in his cross -examination it was suggested to 
PW-27 that he had falsely implicated the accused in the present case but 
simply putting such a suggestion to the investigating officer would not be 
sufficient to accept that the accused had been falsely implicated.  Strong 
foundation s required to be laid by an ac cused who takes a plea of false 
implication  by the police. However, in the present case accused Rajinder 
Kumar has not laid even a weak foundation to sustain the plea of his false 
implication. Even otherwise  none of the two accused had taken the stand 
either while cross -examining the prosecution witnesses or during their own 
statements under Section 313 Cr.P.C.  that  they had been told by PW -1 to 
keep a watch over the two culprits or that they had handled the dead body 
and because of that their clothes had  become blood stained, as had been 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 13 of 21 
 
 
 deposed by PW -1. Therefore, it becomes clear that PW -1 has deliberately 
not identified th e accused persons as the persons who had dragged the 
deceased in injured condition inside room no.802.   We are also of the 
view tha t if at all the two accused had been falsely implicated PW -1 would 
have at least protested when they were over -powered by the police.   
However, he does not even claim to have done that.  
16. It was argued by the learned counsel for the appellant Rajinder 
Kumar that the evidence of this witness cannot be relied upon at all for any 
purpose in favour of the prosecution since he had been got declared hostile 
by the prosecution and instead he supports the accused. This contention 
cannot be accepted since it is n ow too well settled that evidence of a 
prosecution witness who is cross -examined by the prosecutor also can be 
relied upon in favour of the prosecution and in fact even in favour of the 
accused if testimony of such a witness inspires  confidence. So,  we have 
examine d his examination -in-chief as well as his cross -examination 
conducted by the prosecutor and the defence counsel to find out if his 
evidence can be of  help to the prosecution or the defence.  It certainly 
advances the prosecution case to the extent  that two persons had dragged 
the deceased inside room no.802 and at that time the deceased was 
bleeding and the culprits were armed and a drum of the revolver was found 
outside room no.802. His evidence is of no help to the accused since, as 
noticed alrea dy, the accused themselves had not chosen to take the plea 
which this witness had taken during his evidence to shield them.  
17. The next material witness examined by the prosecution is PW -3 C. 
Ramanujan who was the Chief Security Officer of the Siddharth 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 14 of 21 
 
 
 Continental hotel in January,1984.  He deposed that when on the day of the 
incident he went to 8th floor of the hotel on getting information about some 
incident there he had seen some blood on the carpet at a distance of about 
2 ft. from the door of room no. 802 and he had also noticed one drum of a 
revolver and one cartridge lying  on the floor.  Anand(PW -1) met him near 
room no.802 and told him that a man was taken inside room no.802 by two 
persons.  The door of room no.802 was closed from inside and he 
informed the police. He further deposed that the p olice came after ab out 
five minutes and the police on arrival knocked at the door of room No. 802 
and gave a warning to the persons inside to come out otherwise  the door 
would be broken open.  After about three  minutes the door was opened 
and accused Rajneesh and Rajinder came out of  the room (In cross -
examination on behalf of t he accused PW -3 stated that the  accused were 
inside the room when its door was opened).   Rajneesh was having a pistol 
in his hand  and Raj inder was holding a knife  at tha t time  and their clothes 
were blood stained .  Both of them were over -powered by the police.  PW-3 
further deposed that w hen the police entered the roo m the dead body of 
Mr. Rao(the deceased) was found lying inside the bathro om.  From 
accused Rajneesh a purse was recovered  in which there were  visiting cards 
and the driving licence of Mr. Rao besides Rs.2000/ - in cash .  As per this 
witness  a seiko watch (which according to the case of the prosecution 
belonged to the deceased)  was recovered from accused Rajinder .   
18. To the same effect is the testimony of PW -4 Shri Deepak Sethi, who 
was employed as Lobby Manager in Siddharth Continental hotel on the 
day of the incident.   He has also deposed that when the police had got 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 15 of 21 
 
 
 opened t he door of room no. 802 the two accused were found present 
inside and accused Rajneesh was holding a revolver in his hand and 
accused Rajinder was holding a knife in his hand.   He has  also deposed 
about the presence  of the dead body of the deceased in the  bathroom of 
room no. 802 and also that clothes of both the accused were blood stained.   
He has also supported the prosecution case in respect of the recoveries of 
incriminating articles belonging to the deceased from the possession of the 
accused persons . 
19. The evidence of PWs 3 and 4 remained unshaken during their cross -
examination on behalf of the accused persons.   Both of them have fully 
corroborated each other’s version.   As far as presence of blood on the 
clothes of the accused is concerned the s ame was not disputed during the 
cross -examination of  any of these two witnesses .  As noticed already, PW -
1 Anand Kumar had claimed that the clothes of the accused persons had 
got smeared with blood as they had handled the dead body of the 
deceased .  Howeve r, as also noticed already, none of the accused had 
taken such a plea.   In fact, the plea of the deceased/accused in his 
statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was that the police had smeared his 
clothes with blood.   For rejecting the evidence of these two prosecution 
witnesses the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant 
Rajinder Kumar was that both these witnesses were interested witnesses 
being employees  of the hotel and they had deposed falsely in ord er to 
protect the reputation  of the hotel and, therefore,  their evidence should be 
rejected. However, we are not persuaded to accept this argument.   
Nothing has been brought on record in the  lengthy and searching  cross -
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 16 of 21 
 
 
 examination of these two witnesses from which it could be inferred that 
they had any axe to grind against any of the two accused persons.    It was 
also argued by learned counsel for the appellant Rajinder Kumar that the 
version of these two witnesses regarding the presence of the accused inside 
room no. 802 is highly improbab le.  It was contended that the accused 
could have easily escaped from the place of incident after committing the 
murder if actually they had committed the murder.   In our view it is quite 
possible that the accused persons might not have come to know that they 
had been seen by someone dragging the deceased inside room no. 802 and, 
therefore, they might have remained inside the room without realizing that 
they had been seen by someone and the police had been informed.   
Therefore, there is nothing improbable  about the prosecution case to the 
effect that both the accused were found inside the room where the dead 
body of the deceased was recovered.  
20. The third witness to depose about the presence of the accused 
persons inside room no. 802 is the investigating  officer PW -27 Inspector 
L.N. R ao.  He deposed that when he reached the  Siddharth Continental  
hotel on getting  the information about  some incident  there  he had gone to 
8th floor where PW -1 Anand Kumar, PW -3 Ramanuj an and PW -4 Deepak 
Sethi were also present  in front of room no. 802 and there he had noticed a 
drum of   a revolver containing a cartridge and one live cartridge lying on 
the carpet b lood was also noticed on the carpet.   On being informed by 
Anand Kumar that he had seen two persons dragging one ha lf naked 
person inside  room no. 802 he(PW -27) warned  the inmate of room no. 802 
to open it otherwise the police would break open the lock.   After few 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 17 of 21 
 
 
 minutes the door was opened from inside and then he along with Anand 
Kumar, C. Ramanujan  and Deepak Sethi  entered the room and both the 
accused were found present inside.   Accused Rajneesh Kumar was having 
a revolver without a drum and accused Rajinder Kumar was holding an 
open knife in his hand.   This witness then went on to depose about the 
recovery of th e dead body of the deceased from the bathroom of that room, 
recovery of  one purse containing visiting cards and driving licence of the 
deceased  and  Rs.2000/ - in cash and also the recovery of a Seiko watch 
from accused Raj neesh  Kumar and also about recover y of another  Seiko 
watch (Ex.P -17) from accused Rajinder Kumar. Nothing could be extracted 
from this witness also in his cross -examination on behalf of the accused 
persons which could discredit him . Although it was suggested to him that 
he had falsely i mplicated the accused persons but  w e see no reason to 
accept such a stand taken by the accused persons.    This police officer also 
had no axe to grind against any of the two accused persons.  We have 
already observed that the accused laid no foundation to sus tain the plea of 
their false implication.  In fact, his statement to the effect that when he had 
entered inside room no.802 accused Rajneesh Kumar was holding a 
revolver without its drum. This witness as also PWs 1, 3 and 4 had 
claimed that they had seen on e drum of a revolver lying outside room 
no.802 and  supports the prosecution case that  
21. From the evidence of PWs 1, 3, 4 and 27 it stands established 
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons were inside room no. 
802 of Siddharth Continental hote l where  the dead body of the deceased 
was lying inside the bathroom.   The clothes of the accused persons were 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 18 of 21 
 
 
 blood stained at that time.   These incriminating circumstances lead to the 
only conclusion that the deceased had been murdered only by the accus ed 
persons and none else.   There are no missing links in the prosecution case 
and the circumstances established are consistent only with the hypothesis 
of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with his innocence.  
22. The prosecution had also sought to  estabish that one purse 
belonging to the deceased, which contained his visiting cards, an d driving 
licence of the deceas ed besides Rs. 2000/ - in cash was recovered from the 
possession of the deceased – accused Rajneesh.   Although nothing was 
argued in re spect of the evidence in respect of that recovery by the learned 
counsel for appellant Rajinder Kumar but in order to satisfy ourselves 
regarding the conviction of the accused for the offence of robbery we 
examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses , namely, PW -3 C. 
Ramanujan, PW -4 Deepak Sethi and the investigating officer PW -27 SI 
L.N. Rao and we are fully convinced about the recovery of the belongings 
of the deceased from the deceased accused.   The prosecution had also 
sought to establish that fr om the possession of accused - appellant Rajinder 
Kumar one watch(make seiko) belonging to the deceased was recovered.   
In respect of that recovery, which was also sought to be established 
through evidence of PWs 3, 4 and 27, learned counsel for accused 
Rajinder Kumar had submitted that this recovery evidence should not be 
accepted for being used against this accused since it is the p rosecution’s 
own case that one S eiko watch was recovered from the possession of 
accused Rajneesh Kumar and another S eiko watc h was recovered from 
accused Rajinder Kumar also but the prosecution has not led any evid ence 
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 19 of 21 
 
 
 to show that both the  watches were put  up for identification by the w ife of 
the deceased(PW -5) Ms. Vineeta and the Magistrate(PW -10), who 
conducted the identifica tion proceedings in respect of  the S eiko watch (Ex. 
P-17), had also deposed th at there was only one watch of S eiko put up for 
identification and the same  was identified by Ms. Vineeta.  Therefore, 
counsel conten ded, the identification of the S eiko watch  Ex.P-17 in the 
identification proceedings by the wife of the deceased cannot be 
considered to be an incriminating circumstance against accused Rajinder 
Kumar.  Learned Additional Public Prosecutor did not dispute this fact but 
he submitted that even if this ci rcumstance is not used against accused 
Rajinder Kumar the other circumstances are sufficient to sustain his 
conviction.  On this aspect we find force in the argument of the learned 
counsel for appellant Rajinder Kumar and we  are inclined to give benefit 
of doubt to this accused  in respect of t he circumstance of recovery of 
Seiko watch from his possession for the afore -said reasons put forth by his 
learned counsel.  It is an admitted case of the prosecution that from both 
the accused one Seiko watch was reco vered but there is no explanation 
forthcoming as to why only one of those watches was put up for 
identification . That introduces some element of doubt as far as this part of 
the prosecution case is concerned.  However, even then this accused cannot 
escape f rom the consequences of other circumstances which  we have 
already found to have been proved successfully by the prosecution  and  
which inevitably lead to the  guilt of accused Rajinder Kumar  and we are 
more than convinced that that he  was also involve d in t he incident of 
murder -cum-robbery.  
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 20 of 21 
 
 
 23. Even though there was no further link in the chain of circumstances 
required to be established by the prosecution for establishing its case, there 
is any case another circumstance which can be pressed into service by the 
prosecution  as an additional link in the already established chain of 
circumstances.   Appellant Rajinder Kumar  was expected to explain his 
presence at the scene of crime which was a five star hotel where in normal 
course he was not expected to be prese nt. He  had taken a plea in defence 
that he had gone to Siddharth Continental hotel on the day the of incident 
to meet one Ms. Maya Rawat who was working in that hotel and further 
that when the incident had taken place he was with her in the lobby and 
from  there both of them had gone to the 8th floor after noticing commotion 
in the hotel and on the 8th floor a dead body was lying on the floor of a 
room.   He along with Maya was standing outside the room whe n police 
came there and took him  to police station for investigation and then falsely 
implicated him in this case.  He has, however, not even examined Ms. 
Maya Rawat to support his version which shows that this  plea taken by 
him at the time of recording of his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. 
was a fals e plea.  It is now well settled that in a criminal case based on 
circumstantial evidence if an accused takes a false plea that circumstance 
can also form an additional link in the chain of circumstances which 
otherwise the prosecution is able to establish.  
24. For the fore -going reasons, we are of the vi ew that this appeal qua 
accused –appellant Rajinder Kumar must fail and the same is hereby 
dismissed.   Resultantly his conviction  on different counts  and the 
sentences awarded to him by the trial Court are h ereby confirmed.  
          1994:DHC:1-DBCrl. Appeal No. 141/1994          Page 21 of 21 
 
 
 25. Since appellant Rajinder Kumar was granted the benefit of 
suspension of the  sentence s of imprisonment  awarded to him by the trial 
Court and he was released on bail during the pendency of the appeal  his 
bail bonds now stand cancelled  and he shall  be taken into custody 
forthwith .

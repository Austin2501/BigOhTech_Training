subsequently again changed to Sharp Mint Ltd.  
3. The plaintiff/Company is a large produce r of min t ingredients, 
including natural menthol and mint  blends  and has been accredited with ISO 
9001: 2015 and ISO 22000 Certification and its products cater  to various 
global industries.  
4. The case of the plaintiff is that it had obtained Standard Fire & 
Special Perils Insurance Policy  bearing policy No, 271400/11/2014/1160  
from the defendant to cover risks  against its Building, Plant & Machinery 
and Stock  at F - 73, 74, 75 and 75 (A), 76 (B, C & D), Phase - I, Bhiwadi 
Industrial area, Alwar District, Rajasthan  from 27.0 2.2014 to 26.02.2015.  
The Policy covered all the stocks of the Plaintiff Company up to Rs. 380  
Crores . 
5. Another Policy was from M/s Universal Sompo General Insurance 
Co. Ltd,  to insure its Stocks  up to  Rs. 15 0Crores , at the  aforesaid location.  
6. The liability of the Defendant  Company towards the loss of stock was 
71.70% whereas the liability  of Universal Sompo  General Insurance Co. Ltd 
towards the loss of  stock s was 28.30%.  
7. It is submitted that there were fifteen  Distillation Plants (P -01 to  P -
15) installed in the manufacturing unit of the Plaintiff/Company.  Each 
Distillation Plant was constructed of SS -304 which divide s into 10 sections 
with a total height of 44 meter s. Each column is connected to a kettle at the 
bottom which in turn is connected t o a film therm ic heated through a heat 
exchanger. The top end of the column is connected to water cooled 
condenser, in order to  condense and separate the products.  The Columns are  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 3 of 24 
 
filled with  SS - 304 packing grids that provide s sufficient residence time for  
the products having differential boiling points, for the purposes of  
separation . 
8. It is submitted that on 21.04.2014 a fire took place in the factory 
premises which damaged the SS -304 column and SS -304 steel grids packing 
of the distillation  plant P -01. The said Column and all its contents got burnt 
and contaminated resulting in losses in stock and plant . The Police and Fire 
Brigade were immediately intimated about the incident.  
9. The defendant / Insurance Company  appointed M/s R  N Sharma & Co.  
as the preliminary Surveyors  who made a visit to the factory on 23.04.2014 
and took photographs of the affected unit . Subsequently , the Defendant 
appointed Mac  Insurance Surveyors &  Loss Assessors Private Limited to 
survey  the premises and to assess the loss. The Survey team visited the  
affected factory premises at F - 73, 74, 75 and 75 (A), 76 (B, C&D), Phase -
1, Industrial Area, Bhiwadi, District Alwar, Rajasthan,  on 26.04.2014.  
10. The other Insurance Company i.e., Universal Sompo General 
Insurance Company  appointed M/s S I B & Associates, Mumbai  as 
Surveyors to conduct the survey and assess the loss es. 
11. It is submitted that in the Survey conducted by Mac Insurance 
Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited,  plant P -01 and its columns 
were found to be  damaged. The Surveyor examined the possibilities of the 
cause of fire, however, the probable cause of the fire was still under 
investigation.  It was observed that the Columns were vacuum sealed and 
there was no possibility of ingress of air, which is essential for a fire to 
occur. The Surveyor required the plaintiff to dismantle the damaged plant in 
order to evaluate the damage or losses.   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 4 of 24 
 
12. The plaintiff/Company lodged a total claim of Rs. 4,65,43,040  
(Rupees Four  Crores Sixty Five Lakhs Forty Three Thousand and Forty 
only),  which was subsequent ly revised to Rs. 4,12,12,988  comprising of Rs 
3,48,54,023  towards  loss of stock . It is stated that since the stock has been 
insured with two insurers, the proportiona te share of the defendant Company 
for loss of stock is 71.70% and their liability amounts to Rs. 2,49,90,334 . 
Further, amount in the sum of Rs. 63,38,267  is claimed towards loss  on 
account of damage caused to the Plant No. P -01 and Rs.20,699  towards 
expenses incu rred for diffusing the fire.  Thus, the total liability of the 
defendant company is Rs. 3,13,49,300 aside from interest for pre litigation 
period.  
13. It is submitted that the plaintiff duly submitted all the requisite 
documents, despite which the defendant del ayed the payment of the claim 
amount. The plaintiff has also furnished an independent opinion by M/s Puri 
Crawford Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors India Private Limited  
(hereinafter referred to as  “Independent Surveyor s”) on the root cause of the 
fire. The Report dated 23.09.2014  made by Mr. Srinivsasan, Chairman of 
the said Company, stated that the fractionation columns containing 
combustible material in the form of inflammable liquids and source of heat 
in the form of thermic  fluid heater , cannot ini tiate the fire unless there is 
ingression of oxygen from the air.  The cause of ingression of air was 
narrowed down to the failure of the Teflon gasket which usually  cracks over 
a period of time. It is submitted that the aforesaid observation was supported 
by the fact that the fire was first noticed near the manhole cover and the 
shell of the Column.   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 5 of 24 
 
14. Thereafter, M/s Mack Insurance Surveyors, the surveyor 
appointed by the defendant, issued its report dated 04.03.2015 . It is 
submitted that the said Report wrongly assessed the loss of stock at 
Rs.1,79,35,047.00  out of which the proportiona te amount of the defendant 
was determined as Rs. 1,28,59,090 . It is further submitted that the Surveyor 
had also incorrectly assessed the Loss on Plant and Machinery at Rs. 
24,97,238  without  taking into  consideration the fact that there was a loss of 
expenditure of Rs. 2,92,157 towards insulation and the heat Tracer . 
Moreover, the Surveyor had failed to provide the basis of their assessment.  
15. It is submitted that the surveyor of the defendant had principally 
agreed on the findings of the Independent Surveyor , Mr. Srinivasan that 
ingression of air caused the fire  and damage to the plant and stock , but 
wrongly came to the  conclusion that crude Me ntha Oil ignited on its own 
and wrongly considered the loss of 5784.9 Kgs quantity of Mentha Oil 
processing in Plant P -01 as not covered under the Policy on a wrong 
assumption that the loss of the stock was covered under  one of the 
Exceptions to the Policy  and the Defendant was  not liable to indemnify 
against such loss.  
16. It is further submitted that the Surveyor of the defendant failed to 
appreciate that the stock of Crude Mentha Oil was  in its normal course of 
distillation/fractionation in an airtight vacuu m plant and no fire could take 
place in the  absence of oxygen. The Surveyor failed to appreciate that the  
damage to the Plant as well as to the Stocks, was not due to  auto-ignition or 
self-combustion but due to ingression of  oxygen, which took place in the 
Column due to crack of the  Teflon gasket and/or rusting of manhole flange.   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 6 of 24 
 
17. The defendant, vide e -mail dated 26.03.2015, informed the plaintiff 
that the Competent Authority has approved the  net loss at Rs, 24,97,283  
against t he claim of Rs 3,13,49,300 lodged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff 
vide its email dated 10.04. 2015 sought the defendant Company to provide 
bifurcation of the approved sum of Rs. 24,97,283.  Since the plaintiff did not 
receive a reply, the plaintiff thereafte r wrote multiple e -mails demanding the 
details of the approved amount.  
18. On 24.04.2015, the defendant communicated to the plaintiff that 
the former was not liable to indemnify for the  loss of Stocks  as the same 
fell under the Exception provided in the Policy  and the plaintiff was held 
entitled only to the claim for loss of Plant and Machinery which ha d 
been assessed at Rs. 24,97,283.   
19. On receipt of the aforesaid communication, the plaintiff demanded a 
copy of the Survey Report ; however, only an incomplete cop y of the same 
was provided by the defendant vide e -mail dated 31.07.2015.  After perusing 
the Survey Report, the plaintiff vide e -mail dated 09.03.2016 stated that the 
Assessment of Rs. 24,97,283  was unacceptable and thereby sought for a 
reconsideration by the defendant.  
20. Since the defendants did not consider the requests of the plaintiff, it 
issued a Legal Notice dated 10.03.2017 asking  the defendants to pay the 
sum of Rs.3,13,49,300  along with in terest , within 15 days.  The defendant 
gave the Reply dated 12.04.2017 wherein t hey reaffirmed their assessment 
of Rs. 24,97,283 . 
21. Hence, the present Suit has been filed for recovery of Rs. 
3,13,49,300 /- as the loss suffered d ue to the damage caused to the Stocks  
and Plant & Machinery , in addition to Rs. 1,00,90,180 /- toward s the interest  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 7 of 24 
 
for the period 01.05.2015 (approximately one month after the Final Surv ey 
Report) till 05 .12.2017 calculated at the rate of 12% per annum and 
pendente lite  and future interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of 
the Suit till  its realisation.   
22. The defendant was served on 28 .02.2018, but it failed to file the 
Written Statement  and the right to file the same was closed on 10.10.2018.  
23. The plaintiff exam ined PW1  Dr. Kamal Kumar, Vice -President of the 
plaintiff/Company who produced his Affidavit by way of Evidence Ex 
PW1/A .  This witness was not cross -examined by the defendant.  
24. PW2 Mr. G Srinivasan, the Chairman of M/s Puri Crawford Insurance 
Surveyors & Loss Assessors India Private  Limited , had prove d the 
independent Opinion/ Report Ex PW1/57 . He was duly cross -examined on 
behalf of the defendant.  
25. It has been argued by the counsel for the plaintiff  that neither the 
defendant nor their Surveyor has alleged any negligence on the part of the 
plaintiff in its Plants. Considering the fact that a fire can only be caused by 
the ingression of air, the claim of the plaintiff cannot be rejected under the 
Exclusion clause under the Standard Fire and Special Pe rils Policy  as the 
said Exception is not applicable to the facts at hand.  
26. Submissions heard  and the record perused .  
27. Admittedly, the plaintiff had taken a Standard Fire & Special Perils 
Insurance Policy bearing Policy No. 271400/11/2014/1160 Ex PW1/4 
effective from 24.02.2014 to 26.02.2015 covering all their Stocks, Plant and 
Machinery , from the defendant/Insurance Company . The Stocks of the 
plaintiff were  covered upto Rs. 380  crores . The Stocks have also been 
insured with another Company namely Univer sal Sompo General Insurance   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 8 of 24 
 
Co. Ltd  upto Rs. 150 crores. Therefore, the proportional liability of the 
defendant and Universal Sompo General Insurance  Co. Ltd . admittedly,  is 
71.70% and 28.30% respectively.  
28. It is also not under challenge that on 21.04.2014, fire broke in the 
factory of the plaintiff damag ing lower portion of  the SS - 304 Column and 
SS - 304 steel grids packing of Plant No. P -01. As a result , the c ontents 
within the Column were also burnt and contaminated.  The Police and the 
Fire D epartment immediately informed and the Fire Department issued a 
Certificate dated 07.05.2014 Ex PW1/5.  
29. Essentially, the plaintiff made the following Claims  to the defendant 
Company : 
(i) Loss of Stocks –     Rs.2,49,90,33 4. 
(ii) Loss of Plant & Machinery –  Rs. 63,38,267  
(iii) Expenses for Fire Extinguishin g- Rs. 20,699  
Total -    Rs.3,13,49,300 . 
30. A claim of Rs. 3,13,49,300  (aggregate of proportional loss incurred 
due to Loss of Stocks and the total loss to Plant & Machinery) has been 
made from the defendant in accordance to their proportionate share.  
 
Claim for Loss of Stocks:  
31. The defendant rejected the Claim for Loss of Stocks on the ground of 
it being covered under the Exception Clause  under the Policy . 
32. The Exception Clause  in the Policy  reads as under:  
“Fire 
Excluding destruction or damage caused to the property 
insured by   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 9 of 24 
 
a) i) Its own fermentation, natural heating or         
spontaneous combustion.  
ii) It's undergoing any heating or drying process.  
 
b)  Burning of property insured by order of any Public 
Authority. ” 
33. In the present case, the Clause relied on by the defendant, excludes 
damage caused to the insured property due to  its auto -ignition while 
undergoing any heating or drying process .  
34. ""Auto -ignition temperature "" is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary  as 
the temperature that any combust ible will ignite at without any help from an 
outside source . The process of combustion takes place when a substance 
reacts with oxygen to generate heat. The E xclusion Clause exists as there is 
a greater risk of fire in the processing of combustible materials, which 
requires sufficient caution to be exercised in chemical plants.  
35. It is  not in dispute that defendant appointed initially M/s R N Sharma 
& Co. was appointed to conduct a Preliminary Survey after which M/s Mac 
Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited  was appointed as the 
Surveyor for the incident. The team of Surveyors visited the factory on 
26.04.2014 and noted that Plant P -01 was dam aged out of the 15 distillation 
Plants.  
36. After the filing of the Claim by the plaintif f, the defendant sought 
opinion  from the plaintiff  as to why their Claim did not fall under the 
Exception. T he Independent Surveyor namely, Puri Crawford Insurance 
Surv eyors & Loss Assessors India Pvt. Ltd. was appointed by the plaintiff to 
find the root cause of Fire. It gave its detailed Report dated 23.09.2014 Ex. 
PW1/57  as under;   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 10 of 24 
 
“… 
4. The major raw material is Mentha Oil  which is 
fractionally distilled to obtain various products and blends 
such as Alpha Pinene, Fenchene, Limolene, Cineole, Cis -3 
Hexanol, Pentanol etc. The process adopted is to utilize 
the differential boiling points of products to separate them. 
The disti llation results in separation of various products 
including water/moisture. The heating is provided by 
thermic fluid in falling film exchanger. The products and 
blends are all highly inflammable with Flash points less 
than 100°C and Boiling point in the ra nge of 110°C to 
230°C.  
5. It was reported by the Insured that blend CIS Terpene 
was being enriched in the fractionation column on 21April 
2014 when at about 4.10 pm a fire was noticed in the first 
section of the column near manhole cover. Immediate 
efforts  were taken to put out the fire by spraying water at 
the affected section of the column. It took about an hour to 
completely control and put out the fire.  
6. The fire had damaged the lower portion of the 55 -304 
column badly and 55 -304 steel grid packing ha d totally 
melted. The contents were burnt and /or contaminated.  
7. The fractionation column is constructed of 55 - 304 in 
ten sections with total height of 44 Mtrs. At the bottom, the 
column is connected to Kettle which In turn is connected to 
falling film thermic fluid heated heat exchanger. The other 
end of the column is connected to water cooled condenser 
to condense and separate the product. The columns are 
filled with 55 -304 packing grids that provide sufficient 
residence time for products having differ ential boiling 
points to separate. The column works under vacuum in 
closed circuit basis with total reflux arrangement.   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 11 of 24 
 
8. As most of the products and blends are highly 
inflammable with low flash point, the process Is carried 
out under complete vacuum ther eby removing presence of 
air in the column prior to commencement of the process. In 
view of this the drawing of feed is done under vacuum. 
Heating of the feed is done by constantly allowing the feed 
to fall as falling film in the thermic fluid heated excha nge. 
The pumping is under flooded suction.  
9. For any fire to occur we require presence of three 
important elements namely combustible material, source of 
heat and oxygen. The fractionation column contains 
combustible material in the form of inflammable li quids 
and source of heat in the form of thermic fluid heater. 
However, these two elements cannot initiate fire unless 
there is ingression of oxygen from air.  
10. The circumstances of loss and melting of packing 
material and deformation 1st section of column in dicates 
extensive fire in the 1st section of the column which can 
take place only if there is enough continuous source of 
oxygen to allow combustion. The probable source of the 
ingression of oxygen can occur due to any one or 
combinati on of the following:  
a. Improper vacuuming of the column prior to drawing of 
the feed.  
b. Leakage in the circulation pump of the feed  
c. Leakage in the falling film heat exchanger or kettle shell  
d. Leakage/cracking of column shell at higher section  
e. Acc idental leakage of thermic fluid from heat exchanger 
due to failure of pipe  
f. Failure of Teflon gasket of manhole cover allowing 
ingression of air  
g. Rusting of manhole flange causing opening (s) for 
ingression of air   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 12 of 24 
 
11. We have examined all the above possibilities and 
comment as under;  
a. The possibility of fire on account of improper 
vacuuming of the column prior to drawing of the 
feed is unlikely as the column had already been 
under operation for more than 3 hours and about 
200 Kgs of water had been distilled off.  
b. Ingression of air through circulation pump is not 
feasible as the pump is working under flooded 
suction and is under continuous operation since the  
commencement of heating.  
c. There was no damage observed in falling film 
heat exchanger or  kettle shell subsequent to fire and 
therefore ingression of air through crack or damage 
in kettle or heat exchanger is ruled out.  
d. Leakage /cracking of column at higher level are 
also ruled out as the fire was not noticed at higher 
section of the column  and also there was no damage 
to them.  
e. Accidental leakage of thermic fluid is also 
unlikely as contaminated fluid collected subsequent 
to fire from the kettle did not show presence of 
thermic fluid  
12. Thus, the source of ingression of air is narrowed d own 
to failure of Teflon gasket of manhole cover and/or rusting 
of manhole flange causing opening(s). It may be noted that 
Teflon gasket do crack over a period of time and crack can 
allow ingression of air into column as it is working under 
vacuum. Further  the manhole cover including the side 
which is contact with Teflon gasket was found rusted and 
this can lead to opening for ingression of air. The above 
two possibility is fully supported by the fact that fire was 
first noticed near the manhole cover and t he shell of the  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 13 of 24 
 
column and SS packing grids were found badly 
melted/deformed.  
13. The fire had therefore initiated on account of ignition 
of inflammable products under distillation at high 
temperature following the ingression of air into the 
column due to failure of gasket and/or opening caused by 
rusting of manhole flange . The products were all at high 
temperature range where they can easily ignite and 
continuously burn.”  
37. This Report of the Independent Surveyor Ex. PW1/57 was considered 
by the Surveyor of the defendant, M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss 
Assessors Private Limited, who in their Survey Report Ex PW1/58  
essentially agreed with the findings of the Independent Surveyor Report but 
concluded as  under:  
“Cause of Fire : 
During out initial visit to the insured affected plant, we 
met with their technical officials. They have informed us 
that probable cause of fire was under investigation. We 
on our part minutely examined all possibilities of the 
cause of fire, & found that the entire process is 
undert aken in a sealed unit. Though the material Inside 
(Mentha oil) is heated & has a flash point of 100° C & 
boiling point of 110° C to 230° C the column works under 
vacuum & there is no chance of ingress of air into the 
column which is essential for a fire to  happen. Incident 
report states that the Insured's workers sighted a lot of 
smoke.  
 
Any leakage of material from the column could have 
caught fire in itself as the flash point is 100° C while the 
material was boiling beyond this temperature. Hence the 
material does not require any outside source of fire & 
can burn by itself .”  
  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 14 of 24 
 
38. The report Ex. PW1/57  of the Independent Surveyor  appointed by the 
plaintiff and the report Ex. PW1/58 of Surveyor  of the Defendant , both 
agreed that the entire process takes place in sealed unit and even though 
Menthol is at Boiling point, no fire can take place inside the Sealed Column.  
39. The Surveyor of the defendant having so concluded , arrived at a self-
contradictory  conclusion; viz “ Any leakage of material from the column 
could have caught fire in itself as the flash point is 100° C while the 
material was boiling beyond this temperature. Hence the material does not 
require any outside source of fire & can burn by itself .” The Sur veyor in 
the same sentence  states  “Any leakage of material from the column could 
have caught fire in itself "" but later concludes “the material does not 
require any outside source of fire & can burn by itself ” and came to the 
conclusion that this is a case of Auto Ignition that took place due to the 
plaintiffs own heating process . 
40. The Defendant’s Surveyor, M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss 
Assessors Private Limited , vide their Final Survey Report dated 04.03.2015 
Ex. PW1/58  assessed the loss of stock at Rs. 1,79,35,047/ - and proportionate 
share of the defendant at Rs. 1,28,59,090/ - but finally rejected the Claim as 
covered by Exception Clause by holding that this is a case of auto ignition 
or self - combustion and there was no third source to ig nite the fire.  Hence, 
these are perils not covered under the policy or rather they are exception 
to the policy.  
41.  What now warrants attention is whether the case of the plaintiff did 
fall in the Exception Clause.  
42. The Independent Surveyor in its Report Ex. PW1/57  had opined that 
a fire can occur only if three important elements are present i.e. a  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 15 of 24 
 
combustible material, source of heat and oxygen.  The source of leakage 
had been explained in detail and had been concluded that it is clear from the 
above that may be due to  failure of gasket, the material leaked out which 
was already at boiling point and ignited on its own . Similar is the 
conclusion in the Report Ex. PW1/58 of M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & 
Loss Assessors Private Limited , that the distillation of crude Mentha Oil 
takes places within vacuum sealed columns, in which the possibility of 
combustion or fire would arise only when there is ingression of oxygen. 
Despite high temperatures during the processing of Mentha Oil, the 
substance s being proceeded in the distillation column at different levels , do 
not undergo combustion for this very reason  of there being a vacuum and no 
oxygen is present . The fire could occur only if there was a leakage. It is 
therefore , clear that the substance c ould not self -ignite, irrespective of the 
temperature, unless its reacted with oxygen.  
43. It is therefore, held in the light of both the reports which are at ad 
idem that the Mentha Oil could have ignited from some leakage.  It is not the 
heating process of Mentha Oil which could  have generated fire, but it was 
because of the leakage of material and mixing with oxygen  which caused  the 
fire. Thus, the fire in the instant case cannot be considered a s a result of 
the plaintiff ’s own heating process  and is not a  case of Auto -ignition . 
The Exclusion Clause was not applicable to the facts in hand and the 
defendant wrongly rejected the Claim for Loss of Stock under the Standard 
Fire and Special Perils Policy . 
44. It is also pertinent to examine if there was any negligence of the 
insured in not servicing or replacing the vacuum seal gasket , in a timely 
manner and is consequently not entitled to Claims on account of Negligence.   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 16 of 24 
 
45. The Apex Court in New India Assurance Co Ltd v s M/S Mudit 
Roadways ,2023 SCC OnLine SC 15 32, observed that  “In the realm of risk 
and uncertainty, individuals and organisations seek solace in the bastion of 
insurance – a covenant forged on the bedrock of trust. Trust serves as the 
cornerstone, forming the essence of the insurer -insured relation ship. The 
fundamental principle is that insurance is governed by the doctrine of 
uberrimae fidei – there must be complete good faith on the part of the 
insured. The heart & soul of an insurance contract lies in the protection it 
accords to those who wish t o be insured by it. This understanding 
encapsulates the foundational belief that insurance accords protection & 
indemnification, preserving the sanctity of trust within its clauses. 
Effectively, the insurer assumes a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and  
honour their commitment. This responsibility becomes particularly 
pronounced when the insured, in their actions, have not been negligent. In 
light of the vital role that trust plays in insurance contracts, it is important 
to ensure that the insurer adequa tely fulfils the duty that has been cast on 
it, by virtue of such a covenant .” 
46. In the present case, not a word about the negligence on the part of the 
plaintiff, has been made by either the Surveyor of the defendant in its Final 
Survey Report, or the defendant in their Email dated 26.03.2015 Ex PW1/59 
( vide which it approved the Cla im amount to the extent of Rs. 24,97,284/ -) 
or in the Reply to the Legal Notice dated 12.04.2017 Ex PW1/69. In fact, 
Final Survey Report clearly specifies that no breach was observed  on the 
part of the plaintiff.  
47. Moreover, the employees of the plaintiff h ad immediately noticed the 
fire and acted appropriately to prevent its spread. The statement of the  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 17 of 24 
 
employee of the plaintiff narrating the incident of 21.04 2014 has been 
produced below:  
“I Souradip Ghosh (Production Engineer. Distillation 
Section) S/o - Jaydip Ghosh on 21st April, 2014 when I 
was passing through the Control Room, lot of smoke was 
coming from the first floor which caught my eye & 
workers were running here & there, which thus made me 
to run towards the scene of incident & found out that a 
heavy fire was there in Plant P -0l in the first column. 
Everyone were in rush to take control over the fire with 
fire extinguisher. I ran through stairs & in the third floor, 
after breaking the side glass, I have tried to put off the 
fire by pouring pressuri zes water through pipes & 
thereby to cool the column. Doing the same thing in the 
successive floors, by fire we took control over the fire & 
were successful to extinguish. After that, the drain valve 
of the kettle was opened to recover the material, which 
was taken in drum ” 
 
48. Thus, the plaintiff had taken immediate action to minimize the loss 
that could be suffered due to the fire. Having concluded that there has 
been no negligence on the part of the plaintiff, it is held that the plaintiff 
is entitled to be  indemnified for the losses suffered to Stock and Plant & 
Machinery.  
 
Value of Mentha Oil/ Stock  lost in Fire : 
49. Having concluded that the Plaintiff is entitled to the damages for Loss 
of Stock, the other aspect which needs consideration is the quantity of Stock 
lost and its value.  
50. The distillation process takes place in Columns. E ach Column 
consists of thirteen levels where the crude Me ntha Oil undergoes a different  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 18 of 24 
 
process at each level at varying temperatures and there is complete vacuum 
within the column . 
51. The methodology of calculating the quantum of Stock loss, 
adopted by the defendant was not challenged by the plaintiff.  The 
dispute is the rate at which the loss of Mentha Oil/ Stock was to be 
calculated. The value of 28% Cis Terpene (the stock )was calcu lated by the 
plaintiff as under:  
 
 
52. The Plaintiff  had calculated the rate of 28% Cis Terpene using the 
price of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol  i.e. Rs. 26,000 .Invoices  from November 2013 to 
May 2014  Ex. PW1/14 to Ex.  PW-1/20 have been produced by the  plaintiff 
wherein Cis 3 Hexenol has been priced between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 27,000 
to substantiate its loss of Stock.  
53. The Invoice dated 02.04.2014 specifies the price of 98% Cis 3 
Hexenol as Rs. 26,912.25 per Kg. Thereafter, invoice dated 16.04.2014 
records the price as Rs. 22,888.5 per Kg.  
 
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 19 of 24 
 
54. The defendant did not take the average of the various invoices 
produced by the plaintiff but took the selling price of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol  as 
Rs. 22,888.5  based on the last Invoice dated 16.04.2014  as the fire broke on 
21.04.2014. However, the defendant  subtracted the Average Gross Profit to 
arrive at the Cost  for 98% Cis 3 Hexenol  at Rs. 20,599.25.  
55. Therefore, using the cost of  98% Cis 3 Hexenol i.e.Rs. 20,599.25, the 
cost of 28% Cis Terpene  was arrived at Rs.4512.84 per Kg  as und er: 
 
56. There is no evidence if the Cis 3 Hexenol lost in fire was the same as 
was purchased through the Invoices produced by the plaintiff. Further, the 
cost of loss of stock has to be assessed as on the date of loss.  The defendant 
has rightly calculated the value of loss of stock.  
57. The total assessment of loss of stocks by the Surveyor of the 
defendant was Rs. 2,61,06,328.00/ - from which Under Insurance  of Rs. 
81,71,280.66/ - was deducted leaving a total amount adjusted to be paid to be 
Rs. 1,79,35,047.34/ -.The defendant’s Surveyor had calculated the ir 
proportional share for  loss for 5784.9 Kg of 28% Cis Terpene as 
Rs.1,28,59,090 @ Rs. 20,599.25 . Pertinently, the stocks of the plaintiff have 
been insured for a sum of Rs.380,00,00,000. Thus, deduction of Rs. 
5,858,654.06 towards under insurance becomes inapplicable and is wrongly 
 
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 20 of 24 
 
deducted from the due amount. Therefore, the proportional share of the  
defendant Company  deducting under insurance was assessed at Rs. 
1,87,17,744.60/ -, which is hereby awarded to the plaintiff.  
 
II. Claim for Loss of Plant:  
58. The loss of Plant & Machinery was assessed by the Surveyor at Rs. 
24,97,28 3/- vide its email dated 26.03.2015 Ex PW1/59 , which was stated to 
be admissible under the Policy.  It was also informed  that the aforesaid 
amount would not be settled unless the plaintiff agree d to accept the loss 
computed by the defendant.  
59. With respect to Loss of Plant and fire extinguishing expenses, the 
plaintiff had made a claim of  Rs. 63,38,267 /-. It was observed in the Final 
Survey Report that the plaintiff had replaced the damaged machinery for 
which the Invoices proving the replacement cost , had been provided.  
60. The Surveyor of the defendant has taken into account all the invoices 
produced by the plaintiff  while comput ing the losses to the Plant as under:   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 21 of 24 
 
 
 
 
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 22 of 24 
 
61. It may be observed that the defendant has deducted the claim for VAT 
and Excise Duty,  for which there is no  cogent basis.  Further, the defendant 
has reduced the dismantling charges  and Heat Tracker charges  by 50% of 
the charges claimed.  There is no basis for these deductions.  
62. The Policy of the plaintiff is not subject to Underinsurance  as the 
loss towards the Plant , machinery and accessories  is covered upto Rs. 
41,50,00,000  while the claim has been raised only for Rs. 63,38,267 . 
Therefore, no underinsurance in the sum of Rs.87,633.38 could be deducted 
while calculating the loss.  
63.  The defendant has further deducted depreciation amount at 34.06% 
amounting to Rs. 18,62,653.87 was deducted . The Insurance Policy 
Ex.PW1/4 in its first paragraph provides “the Company shall pay to the 
insured the value of the property at the time of happe ning of its destruction 
or the amount of such damage or at its option reinstate or replace such 
property or any part thereo f”. This implies  that there were three options 
with the defendant, viz. firstly to pay the value of the property at the time of 
damag e, or secondly  the amount of such damage or thirdly  to reinstate or 
replace the property. Neither first nor third option has been exercised. The 
plaintiff has got the damaged facility restored for which details have been 
given, which are  accepted by the defendant. In the circumstances, when this 
is the actual cost incurred by the plaintiff, there is no justification for 
Deduction of Rs. 18,62,653. 87 towards depreciation.  
64. The defendant has calculated the salvage value  of the scrap at 15%  
which came to Rs.5,40,913 .37 which has been deduct ed from the Claim , 
which is held justified .   
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 23 of 24 
 
65. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to a sum of R s. 57,97 ,353.63 is 
held justified and payable towards loss of Plant  and Machinery . 
 
III. Fire extinguishing expenses:  
66. A claim of Rs. 20,699 was made by the plaintiff. This claim amount 
was allowed by the Surveyor after the deduction of VAT at Rs. 958  i.e. Rs. 
19,741 . It is held that, the plaintiff is entitled to the said amount  of Rs. 
20,699 as Fire Extinguishing expenses . 
Conclusion:  
67. The plaintiff is held entitled to the following Claims:  
   Loss of Stocks –    Rs. 1 ,87,17,744.60 . 
   Loss of Plant & Machinery –  Rs.57,97,353.63 . 
   Expenses for Fire Extinguishing  -- Rs. 20,699 . 
Total - Rs.2,45,35,797.20 . 
 
Interest:  
68. The plaintiff has also claimed interest @ 12% p.a. However, 
considering the prevailing market rate, the interest is awarded @6% p.a. 
w.e.f. 01.05.2015 till the date of realization.  
 
Relief:  
69. The plaintiff/Company is, therefore, held entitled to the recovery of 
amount Rs .2,45,35,797.20   (Two Crore  Forty -Five Lacs Thirty Five 
Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Seven Rupees and Twenty Paise) along  
CS(COMM) 2 6/2018                                                                                                                  Page 24 of 24 
 
with interest @ 6 % w.e.f. 01.05.2015  till the date of realization. Parties to 
bear their own costs.  
70. The pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.  
71. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed in the above terms. The

HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA

     J    U    D    G    M    E    N    T
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
1. The present Suit for Recovery of Rs. 4,14,39,480/- has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff. 
2. Briefly stated, the plaintiff is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 having its registered Office at Sharp House, Plot No. 9, LSC, Gujranwala Town-I, Delhi-110009. It is engaged in manufacturing ofnatural menthols and its allied products and have its main manufacturing unit at F - 73, 74, 75 and 75 (A), 76 (B, C & D), Phase - I, Bhiwadi Industrial area, Alwar District, Rajasthan. The plaintiffCompany was initially known as Laxmi Aromatics Private Limited and then changed its name to Sharp Aromatics India Private Limited and then to Sharp Aromatics India Limited. In September, 2008,  Sharp Aromatics India Limited merged with Sharp Menthol India Limited. The name of the plaintiff Company was changed from  25.11.2011, to Sharp Global Ltd. w.e.f. 17.09.2014, but was subsequently again changed to Sharp Mint Ltd. 
3. The plaintiff/Company is a large producer of mint ingredients, including natural menthol and mint blends and has been accredited with ISO 9001: 2015 and ISO 22000 Certification and its products cater to various global industries. 
4. The case of the plaintiff is that it had obtained Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy bearing policy No, 271400/11/2014/1160 from the defendant to cover risks against its Building, Plant & Machinery and Stock at F - 73, 74, 75 and 75 (A), 76 (B, C & D), Phase - I, Bhiwadi Industrial area, Alwar District, Rajasthan from 27.02.2014 to 26.02.2015. The Policy covered all the stocks of the Plaintiff Company up to Rs. 380 Crores.
5. Another Policy was from M/s Universal Sompo General Insurance Co. Ltd, to insure its Stocks up to Rs. 150Crores, at the aforesaid location.
6. The liability of the Defendant Company towards the loss of stock was 71.70% whereas the liability of Universal Sompo General Insurance Co. Ltd towards the loss of stocks was 28.30%.
7. It is submitted that there were fifteen Distillation Plants (P-01 to  P-15) installed in the manufacturing unit of the Plaintiff/Company.  Each Distillation Plant was constructed of SS-304 which divides into 10 sections with a total height of 44 meters. Each column is connected to a kettle at the bottom which in turn is connected to a film thermic heated through a heat exchanger. The top end of the column is connected to water cooled condenser, in order to condense and separate the products. The Columns are filled with SS - 304 packing grids that provides sufficient residence time for the products having differential boiling points, for the purposes of separation.
8. It is submitted that on 21.04.2014 a fire took place in the factory premises which damaged the SS-304 column and SS-304 steel grids packing of the distillation plant P-01. The said Column and all its contents got burnt and contaminated resulting in losses in stock and plant. The Police and Fire Brigade were immediately intimated about the incident. 
9. The defendant/ Insurance Company appointed M/s R N Sharma & Co. as the preliminary Surveyors who made a visit to the factory on 23.04.2014 and took photographs of the affected unit. Subsequently, the Defendant appointed Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited to survey the premises and to assess the loss. The Survey team visited the affected factory premises at F - 73, 74, 75 and 75 (A), 76 (B, C&D), Phase -1, Industrial Area, Bhiwadi, District Alwar, Rajasthan, on 26.04.2014.
10. The other Insurance Company i.e., Universal Sompo General Insurance Company appointed M/s S I B & Associates, Mumbai as Surveyors to conduct the survey and assess the losses.
11. It is submitted that in the Survey conducted by Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited, plant P-01 and its columns were found to be damaged. The Surveyor examined the possibilities of the cause of fire, however, the probable cause of the fire was still under investigation. It was observed that the Columns were vacuum sealed and there was no possibility of ingress of air, which is essential for a fire to occur. The Surveyor required the plaintiff to dismantle the damaged plant in order to evaluate the damage or losses.
12. The plaintiff/Company lodged a total claim of Rs. 4,65,43,040 (Rupees Four Crores Sixty Five Lakhs Forty Three Thousand and Forty only), which was subsequently revised to Rs. 4,12,12,988 comprising of Rs 3,48,54,023 towards loss of stock. It is stated that since the stock has been insured with two insurers, the proportionate share of the defendant Company for loss of stock is 71.70% and their liability amounts to Rs. 2,49,90,334. Further, amount in the sum of Rs. 63,38,267 is claimed towards loss on account of damage caused to the Plant No. P-01 and Rs.20,699 towards expenses incurred for diffusing the fire. Thus, the total liability of the defendant company is Rs. 3,13,49,300 aside from interest for pre litigation period.
13. It is submitted that the plaintiff duly submitted all the requisite documents, despite which the defendant delayed the payment of the claim amount. The plaintiff has also furnished an independent opinion by M/s Puri Crawford Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors India Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as Independent Surveyors) on the root cause of the fire. The Report dated 23.09.2014 made by Mr. Srinivsasan, Chairman of the said Company, stated that the fractionation columns containing combustible material in the form of inflammable liquids and source of heat in the form of thermic fluid heater, cannot initiate the fire unless there is ingression of oxygen from the air. The cause of ingression of air was narrowed down to the failure of the Teflon gasket which usually cracks over a period of time. It is submitted that the aforesaid observation was supported by the fact that the fire was first noticed near the manhole cover and the shell of the Column.
14. Thereafter, M/s Mack Insurance Surveyors, the surveyor appointed by the defendant, issued its report dated 04.03.2015. It is submitted that the said Report wrongly assessed the loss of stock at Rs.1,79,35,047.00 out of which the proportionate amount of the defendant was determined as Rs. 1,28,59,090. It is further submitted that the Surveyor had also incorrectly assessed the Loss on Plant and Machinery at Rs. 24,97,238 without taking into consideration the fact that there was a loss of expenditure of Rs. 2,92,157 towards insulation and the heat Tracer. Moreover, the Surveyor had failed to provide the basis of their assessment.
15. It is submitted that the surveyor of the defendant had principally agreed on the findings of the Independent Surveyor, Mr. Srinivasan that ingression of air caused the fire and damage to the plant and stock, but wrongly came to the conclusion that crude Mentha Oil ignited on its own and wrongly considered the loss of 5784.9 Kgs quantity of Mentha Oil processing in Plant P-01 as not covered under the Policy on a wrong assumption that the loss of the stock was covered under one of the Exceptions to the Policy and the Defendant was not liable to indemnify against such loss.
16. It is further submitted that the Surveyor of the defendant failed to appreciate that the stock of Crude Mentha Oil was in its normal course of distillation/fractionation in an airtight vacuum plant and no fire could take place in the absence of oxygen. The Surveyor failed to appreciate that the damage to the Plant as well as to the Stocks, was not due to auto-ignition or self-combustion but due to ingression of oxygen, which took place in the Column due to crack of the Teflon gasket and/or rusting of manhole flange.
17. The defendant, vide e-mail dated 26.03.2015, informed the plaintiff that the Competent Authority has approved the net loss at Rs, 24,97,283 against the claim of Rs 3,13,49,300 lodged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff vide its email dated 10.04.2015 sought the defendant Company to provide bifurcation of the approved sum of Rs. 24,97,283. Since the plaintiff did not receive a reply, the plaintiff thereafter wrote multiple e-mails demanding the details of the approved amount.
18. On 24.04.2015, the defendant communicated to the plaintiff that the former was not liable to indemnify for the loss of Stocks as the same fell under the Exception provided in the Policy and the plaintiff was held entitled only to the claim for loss of Plant and Machinery which had been assessed at Rs. 24,97,283.	
19. On receipt of the aforesaid communication, the plaintiff demanded a copy of the Survey Report; however, only an incomplete copy of the same was provided by the defendant vide e-mail dated 31.07.2015. After perusing the Survey Report, the plaintiff vide e-mail dated 09.03.2016 stated that the Assessment of Rs. 24,97,283 was unacceptable and thereby sought for a reconsideration by the defendant.
20. Since the defendants did not consider the requests of the plaintiff, it issued a Legal Notice dated 10.03.2017 asking the defendants to pay the sum of Rs.3,13,49,300 along with interest, within 15 days.  The defendant gave the Reply dated 12.04.2017 wherein they reaffirmed their assessment of Rs. 24,97,283.
21. Hence, the present Suit has been filed for recovery of Rs. 3,13,49,300/- as the loss suffered due to the damage caused to the Stocks and Plant & Machinery, in addition to Rs. 1,00,90,180/- towards the interest for the period 01.05.2015 (approximately one month after the Final Survey Report) till 05.12.2017 calculated at the rate of 12% per annum and pendente lite and future interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of the Suit till its realisation.  
22. The defendant was served on 28.02.2018, but it failed to file the Written Statement and the right to file the same was closed on 10.10.2018.
23. The plaintiff examined PW1 Dr. Kamal Kumar, Vice-President of the plaintiff/Company who produced his Affidavit by way of Evidence Ex PW1/A.  This witness was not cross-examined by the defendant.
24. PW2Mr. G Srinivasan, the Chairman of M/s Puri Crawford Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors India Private Limited, had proved the independent Opinion/ Report Ex PW1/57. He was duly cross-examined on behalf of the defendant.
25. It has been argued by the counsel for the plaintiff that neither the defendant nor their Surveyor has alleged any negligence on the part of the plaintiff in its Plants. Considering the fact that a fire can only be caused by the ingression of air, the claim of the plaintiff cannot be rejected under the Exclusion clause under the Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy as the said Exception is not applicable to the facts at hand.
26. Submissions heard and the record perused. 
27. Admittedly, the plaintiff had taken a Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy bearing Policy No. 271400/11/2014/1160Ex PW1/4 effective from 24.02.2014 to 26.02.2015 covering all their Stocks, Plant and Machinery, from the defendant/Insurance Company. The Stocks of the plaintiff were covered upto Rs. 380 crores. The Stocks have also been insured with another Company namely Universal Sompo General Insurance Co. Ltd upto Rs. 150 crores. Therefore, the proportional liability of the defendant and Universal Sompo General Insurance Co. Ltd. admittedly, is 71.70% and 28.30% respectively.
28. It is also not under challenge that on 21.04.2014, fire broke in the factory of the plaintiff damaging lower portion of the SS - 304 Column and SS - 304 steel grids packing of Plant No. P-01. As a result, the contents within the Column were also burnt and contaminated. The Police and the Fire Department immediately informed and the Fire Department issued a Certificate dated 07.05.2014 Ex PW1/5. 
29. Essentially, the plaintiff made the following Claims to the defendant Company:
(i) Loss of Stocks  			 Rs.2,49,90,334.
(ii) Loss of Plant & Machinery  	Rs. 63,38,267 
(iii) Expenses for Fire Extinguishing- Rs. 20,699
Total-				Rs.3,13,49,300.
30. A claim of Rs. 3,13,49,300 (aggregate of proportional loss incurred due to Loss of Stocks and the total loss to Plant & Machinery) has been made from the defendant in accordance to their proportionate share.

Claim for Loss of Stocks:
31. The defendant rejected the Claim for Loss of Stocks on the ground of it being covered under the Exception Clause  under the Policy.
32. The Exception Clause in the Policy  reads as under: 
Fire
Excluding destruction or damage caused to the property insured by
a) i) Its own fermentation, natural heating or         spontaneous combustion.
    ii) It's undergoing any heating or drying process.
    
b)  Burning of property insured by order of any Public Authority.
33. In the present case, the Clause relied on by the defendant, excludes damage caused to the insured property due to its auto -ignition while undergoing any heating or drying process. 
34. ""Auto-ignition temperature"" is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary  as the temperature that any combustible will ignite at without any help from an outside source. The process of combustion takes place when a substance reacts with oxygen to generate heat. The Exclusion Clause exists as there is a greater risk of fire in the processing of combustible materials, which requires sufficient caution to be exercised in chemical plants.
35. It is  not in dispute that defendant appointed initially M/s R N Sharma & Co. was appointed to conduct a Preliminary Survey after which M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited was appointed as the Surveyor for the incident. The team of Surveyors visited the factory on 26.04.2014 and noted that Plant P-01 was damaged out of the 15 distillation Plants.
36. After the filing of the Claim by the plaintiff, the defendant sought opinion from the plaintiff as to why their Claim did not fall under the Exception. The Independent Surveyor namely, Puri Crawford Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors India Pvt. Ltd. was appointed by the plaintiff to find the root cause of Fire. It gave its detailed Report dated 23.09.2014 Ex. PW1/57 as under;

4. The major raw material is Mentha Oil which is fractionally distilled to obtain various products and blends such as Alpha Pinene, Fenchene, Limolene, Cineole, Cis-3 Hexanol, Pentanol etc. The process adopted is to utilize the differential boiling points of products to separate them. The distillation results in separation of various products including water/moisture. The heating is provided by thermic fluid in falling film exchanger. The products and blends are all highly inflammable with Flash points less than 100°C and Boiling point in the range of 110°C to 230°C.
5. It was reported by the Insured that blend CIS Terpene was being enriched in the fractionation column on 21April 2014 when at about 4.10 pm a fire was noticed in the first section of the column near manhole cover. Immediate efforts were taken to put out the fire by spraying water at the affected section of the column. It took about an hour to completely control and put out the fire.
6. The fire had damaged the lower portion of the 55-304 column badly and 55-304 steel grid packing had totally melted. The contents were burnt and /or contaminated.
7. The fractionation column is constructed of 55- 304 in ten sections with total height of 44 Mtrs. At the bottom, the column is connected to Kettle which In turn is connected to falling film thermic fluid heated heat exchanger. The other end of the column is connected to water cooled condenser to condense and separate the product. The columns are filled with 55-304 packing grids that provide sufficient residence time for products having differential boiling points to separate. The column works under vacuum in closed circuit basis with total reflux arrangement.
8. As most of the products and blends are highly inflammable with low flash point, the process Is carried out under complete vacuum thereby removing presence of air in the column prior to commencement of the process. In view of this the drawing of feed is done under vacuum. Heating of the feed is done by constantly allowing the feed to fall as falling film in the thermic fluid heated exchange. The pumping is under flooded suction.
9. For any fire to occur we require presence of three important elements namely combustible material, source of heat and oxygen. The fractionation column contains combustible material in the form of inflammable liquids and source of heat in the form of thermic fluid heater. However, these two elements cannot initiate fire unless there is ingression of oxygen from air.
10. The circumstances of loss and melting of packing material and deformation 1st section of column indicates extensive fire in the 1st section of the column which can take place only if there is enough continuous source of oxygen to allow combustion. The probable source of the ingression of oxygen can occur due to any one or combination of the following:
a. Improper vacuuming of the column prior to drawing of the feed.
b. Leakage in the circulation pump of the feed
c. Leakage in the falling film heat exchanger or kettle shell
d. Leakage/cracking of column shell at higher section
e. Accidental leakage of thermic fluid from heat exchanger due to failure of pipe
f. Failure of Teflon gasket of manhole cover allowing ingression of air
g. Rusting of manhole flange causing opening (s) for ingression of air
11. We have examined all the above possibilities and comment as under;
a. The possibility of fire on account of improper vacuuming of the column prior to drawing of the feed is unlikely as the column had already been under operation for more than 3 hours and about 200 Kgs of water had been distilled off.
b. Ingression of air through circulation pump is not feasible as the pump is working under flooded suction and is under continuous operation since the
     commencement of heating.
c. There was no damage observed in falling film heat exchanger or kettle shell subsequent to fire and therefore ingression of air through crack or damage in kettle or heat exchanger is ruled out.
d. Leakage /cracking of column at higher level are also ruled out as the fire was not noticed at higher section of the column and also there was no damage to them.
e. Accidental leakage of thermic fluid is also unlikely as contaminated fluid collected subsequent to fire from the kettle did not show presence of thermic fluid
12. Thus, the source of ingression of air is narrowed down to failure of Teflon gasket of manhole cover and/or rusting of manhole flange causing opening(s). It may be noted that Teflon gasket do crack over a period of time and crack can allow ingression of air into column as it is working under vacuum. Further the manhole cover including the side which is contact with Teflon gasket was found rusted and this can lead to opening for ingression of air. The above two possibility is fully supported by the fact that fire was first noticed near the manhole cover and the shell of the column and SS packing grids were found badly melted/deformed.
13. The fire had therefore initiated on account of ignition of inflammable products under distillation at high temperature following the ingression of air into the column due to failure of gasket and/or opening caused by rusting of manhole flange. The products were all at high temperature range where they can easily ignite and continuously burn.
37. This Report of the Independent Surveyor Ex. PW1/57 was considered by the Surveyor of the defendant, M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited, who in their Survey Report Ex PW1/58 essentially agreed with the findings of the Independent Surveyor Report but concluded as  under:
Cause of Fire:
During out initial visit to the insured affected plant, we met with their technical officials. They have informed us that probable cause of fire was under investigation. We on our part minutely examined all possibilities of the cause of fire, & found that the entire process is undertaken in a sealed unit. Though the material Inside (Mentha oil) is heated & has a flash point of 100° C & boiling point of 110° C to 230° C the column works under vacuum & there is no chance of ingress of air into the column which is essential for a fire to happen. Incident report states that the Insured's workers sighted a lot of smoke. 

Any leakage of material from the column could have caught fire in itself as the flash point is 100° C while the material was boiling beyond this temperature. Hence the material does not require any outside source of fire & can burn by itself. 

38. The report Ex. PW1/57 of the Independent Surveyor appointed by the plaintiff and the report Ex. PW1/58 of Surveyor of the Defendant, both agreed that the entire process takes place in sealed unit and even though Menthol is at Boiling point, no fire can take place inside the Sealed Column. 
39. The Surveyor of the defendant having so concluded, arrived at a self-contradictory conclusion; viz Any leakage of material from the column could have caught fire in itself as the flash point is 100° C while the material was boiling beyond this temperature. Hence the material does not require any outside source of fire & can burn by itself. The Surveyor in the same sentence states Any leakage of material from the column could have caught fire in itself"" but later concludes the material does not require any outside source of fire & can burn by itself and came to the conclusion that this is a case of Auto Ignition that took place due to the plaintiffs own heating process.
40. The Defendants Surveyor, M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited, vide their Final Survey Report dated 04.03.2015 Ex. PW1/58 assessed the loss of stock at Rs. 1,79,35,047/- and proportionate share of the defendant at Rs. 1,28,59,090/- but finally rejected the Claim as covered by Exception Clauseby holding that this is a case of auto ignition or self- combustion and there was no third source to ignite the fire. Hence, these are perils not covered under the policy or rather they are exception to the policy.
41.  What now warrants attention is whether the case of the plaintiff did fall in the Exception Clause.
42. The Independent Surveyor in its Report Ex. PW1/57  had opined that a fire can occur only if three important elements are present i.e. a combustible material, source of heat and oxygen. The source of leakage had been explained in detail and had been concluded that it is clear from the above that may be due to failure of gasket, the material leaked out which was already at boiling point and ignited on its own. Similar is the conclusion in the Report Ex. PW1/58 of M/s Mac Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors Private Limited, that the distillation of crude Mentha Oil takes places within vacuum sealed columns, in which the possibility of combustion or fire would arise only when there is ingression of oxygen. Despite high temperatures during the processing of Mentha Oil, the substances being proceeded in the distillation column at different levels, do not undergo combustion for this very reason of there being a vacuum and no oxygen is present. The fire could occur only if there was a leakage. It is therefore, clear that the substance could not self-ignite, irrespective of the temperature, unless its reacted with oxygen. 
43. It is therefore, held in the light of both the reports which are at ad idem that the Mentha Oil could have ignited from some leakage. It is not the heating process of Mentha Oil which could  have generated fire, but it was because of the leakage of material and mixing with oxygen which caused the fire. Thus, the fire in the instant case cannot be considered as a result of the plaintiffs own heating process and is not a case of Auto-ignition. The Exclusion Clause was not applicable to the facts in hand and the defendant wrongly rejected the Claim for Loss of Stock under the Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy.
44. It is also pertinent to examine if there was any negligence of the insured in not servicing or replacing the vacuum seal gasket, in a timely manner and is consequently not entitled to Claims on account of Negligence.
45. The Apex Court in New India Assurance Co Ltd vs M/S Mudit Roadways,2023 SCC OnLine SC 1532, observed that In the realm of risk and uncertainty, individuals and organisations seek solace in the bastion of insurance  a covenant forged on the bedrock of trust. Trust serves as the cornerstone, forming the essence of the insurer-insured relationship. The fundamental principle is that insurance is governed by the doctrine of uberrimae fidei  there must be complete good faith on the part of the insured. The heart & soul of an insurance contract lies in the protection it accords to those who wish to be insured by it. This understanding encapsulates the foundational belief that insurance accords protection & indemnification, preserving the sanctity of trust within its clauses. Effectively, the insurer assumes a fiduciary duty to act in good faith and honour their commitment. This responsibility becomes particularly pronounced when the insured, in their actions, have not been negligent. In light of the vital role that trust plays in insurance contracts, it is important to ensure that the insurer adequately fulfils the duty that has been cast on it, by virtue of such a covenant.
46. In the present case, not a word about the negligence on the part of the plaintiff, has been made by either the Surveyor of the defendant in its Final Survey Report, or the defendant in their Email dated 26.03.2015 Ex PW1/59 ( vide which it approved the Claim amount to the extent of Rs. 24,97,284/-) or in the Reply to the Legal Notice dated 12.04.2017 Ex PW1/69. In fact, Final Survey Report clearly specifies that no breach was observed on the part of the plaintiff. 
47. Moreover, the employees of the plaintiff had immediately noticed the fire and acted appropriately to prevent its spread. The statement of the employee of the plaintiff narrating the incident of 21.04 2014 has been produced below:
I Souradip Ghosh (Production Engineer. Distillation Section) S/o- Jaydip Ghosh on 21st April, 2014 when I was passing through the Control Room, lot of smoke was coming from the first floor which caught my eye & workers were running here & there, which thus made me to run towards the scene of incident & found out that a heavy fire was there in Plant P-0l in the first column. Everyone were in rush to take control over the fire with fire extinguisher. I ran through stairs & in the third floor, after breaking the side glass, I have tried to put off the fire by pouring pressurizes water through pipes & thereby to cool the column. Doing the same thing in the successive floors, by fire we took control over the fire & were successful to extinguish. After that, the drain valve of the kettle was opened to recover the material, which was taken in drum

48. Thus, the plaintiff had taken immediate action to minimize the loss that could be suffered due to the fire. Having concluded that there has been no negligence on the part of the plaintiff, it is held that the plaintiff is entitled to be indemnified for the losses suffered to Stock and Plant & Machinery.

Value of Mentha Oil/ Stock lost in Fire:
49. Having concluded that the Plaintiff is entitled to the damages for Loss of Stock, the other aspect which needs consideration is the quantity of Stock lost and its value.
50. The distillation process takes place in Columns. Each Column consists of thirteen levels where the crude Mentha Oil undergoes a different process at each level at varying temperatures and there is complete vacuum within the column.
51. The methodology of calculating the quantum of Stock loss, adopted by the defendant was not challenged by the plaintiff. The dispute is the rate at which the loss of Mentha Oil/ Stock was to be calculated. The value of 28% Cis Terpene (the stock)was calculated by the plaintiff as under:


52. The Plaintiff had calculated the rate of 28% Cis Terpene using the price of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol i.e. Rs. 26,000.Invoices from November 2013 to May 2014 Ex. PW1/14 to Ex. PW-1/20 have been produced by the plaintiff wherein Cis 3 Hexenol has been priced between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 27,000 to substantiate its loss of Stock.
53. The Invoice dated 02.04.2014 specifies the price of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol as Rs. 26,912.25 per Kg. Thereafter, invoice dated 16.04.2014 records the price as Rs. 22,888.5 per Kg.
54. The defendant did not take the average of the various invoices produced by the plaintiff but took the selling price of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol  as Rs. 22,888.5  based on the last Invoice dated 16.04.2014 as the fire broke on 21.04.2014. However, the defendant  subtracted the Average Gross Profit to arrive at the Cost  for 98% Cis 3 Hexenol at Rs. 20,599.25.
55. Therefore, using the cost of 98% Cis 3 Hexenol i.e.Rs. 20,599.25, the cost of 28% Cis Terpene was arrived at Rs.4512.84 per Kg as under:

56. There is no evidence if the Cis 3 Hexenol lost in fire was the same as was purchased through the Invoices produced by the plaintiff. Further, the cost of loss of stock has to be assessed as on the date of loss. The defendant has rightly calculated the value of loss of stock.
57. The total assessment of loss of stocks by the Surveyor of the defendant was Rs. 2,61,06,328.00/- from which Under Insurance of Rs. 81,71,280.66/- was deducted leaving a total amount adjusted to be paid to be Rs. 1,79,35,047.34/-.The defendants Surveyor had calculated their proportional share for loss for 5784.9 Kg of 28% Cis Terpene as Rs.1,28,59,090@ Rs. 20,599.25. Pertinently, the stocks of the plaintiff have been insured for a sum of Rs.380,00,00,000. Thus, deduction of Rs. 5,858,654.06 towards under insurance becomes inapplicable and is wrongly deducted from the due amount. Therefore, the proportional share of the defendant Company  deducting under insurance was assessed at Rs. 1,87,17,744.60/-, which is hereby awarded to the plaintiff. 

II. Claim for Loss of Plant:
58. The loss of Plant & Machinery was assessed by the Surveyor at Rs. 24,97,283/- vide its email dated 26.03.2015 Ex PW1/59, which was stated to be admissible under the Policy. It was also informed  that the aforesaid amount would not be settled unless the plaintiff agreed to accept the loss computed by the defendant.
59. With respect to Loss of Plant and fire extinguishing expenses, the plaintiff had made a claim of Rs. 63,38,267/-. It was observed in the Final Survey Report that the plaintiff had replaced the damaged machinery for which the Invoices proving the replacement cost, had been provided. 
60. The Surveyor of the defendant has taken into account all the invoices produced by the plaintiff while computing the losses to the Plant as under:


61. It may be observed that the defendant has deducted the claim for VAT and Excise Duty, for which there is no cogent basis. Further, the defendant has reduced the dismantling charges and Heat Tracker charges by 50% of the charges claimed. There is no basis for these deductions. 
62. The Policy of the plaintiff is not subject to Underinsurance as the loss towards the Plant, machinery and accessories is covered upto Rs. 41,50,00,000 while the claim has been raised only for Rs. 63,38,267. Therefore, no underinsurance in the sum of Rs.87,633.38 could be deducted while calculating the loss.
63.  The defendant has further deducted depreciation amount at 34.06% amounting to Rs. 18,62,653.87 was deducted. The Insurance Policy Ex.PW1/4 in its first paragraph provides the Company shall pay to the insured the value of the property at the time of happening of its destruction or the amount of such damage or at its option reinstate or replace such property or any part thereof. This implies that there were three options with the defendant, viz. firstly to pay the value of the property at the time of damage, or secondly the amount of such damage or thirdly to reinstate or replace the property. Neither first nor third option has been exercised. The plaintiff has got the damaged facility restored for which details have been given, which are accepted by the defendant. In the circumstances, when this is the actual cost incurred by the plaintiff, there is no justification for Deduction of Rs.18,62,653.87 towards depreciation.
64. The defendant has calculated the salvage value of the scrap at 15% which came to Rs.5,40,913.37 which has been deducted from the Claim, which is held justified. 
65. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to a sum of Rs. 57,97,353.63 is held justified and payable towards loss of Plant and Machinery.

III. Fire extinguishing expenses:
66. A claim of Rs. 20,699 was made by the plaintiff. This claim amount was allowed by the Surveyor after the deduction of VAT at Rs. 958 i.e. Rs. 19,741. It is held that, the plaintiff is entitled to the said amount of Rs. 20,699 as Fire Extinguishing expenses.
Conclusion:
67. The plaintiff is held entitled to the following Claims:
			Loss of Stocks  			Rs. 1,87,17,744.60.
			Loss of Plant & Machinery  	Rs.57,97,353.63.
			Expenses for Fire Extinguishing -- Rs. 20,699.
Total-	Rs.2,45,35,797.20.

Interest:
68. The plaintiff has also claimed interest @ 12% p.a. However, considering the prevailing market rate, the interest is awarded @6% p.a. w.e.f. 01.05.2015 till the date of realization. 

Relief:
69. The plaintiff/Company is, therefore, held entitled to the recovery of amount Rs.2,45,35,797.20  (Two Crore  Forty-Five Lacs Thirty Five Thousand Seven Hundred Ninety Seven Rupees and Twenty Paise) along with interest @ 6 % w.e.f. 01.05.2015 till the date of realization. Parties to bear their own costs. 
70. The pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.
71. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed in the above terms. The Decree Sheet be prepared accordingly.

Governmental and Statutory Rules by the defendant Company with its other 
members, a Special Notice was issued against him for his removal , as per 
Section 284 of the Companies Act , 1956 ( now section 169 of  Companies 
Act, 2013 ). However, this Notice was not served to the plaintiff. Thereafter , 
on 24.10.2012 he was  summarily and unlawfully discharged from the office 
of Director ship that had  allegedly harmed his reputation in the industry.  
4. The plaintiff thus, filed the present suit for the Recovery of  money for 
the value of 51,273 shares of the defendant Company, as well as a 
compensation for the loss  of reputation suffered due to termination  of his 
Directorship in the defendant Company.  
5. The defendant/applicant in the application  under Order  VII Rule 
11 CPC, has taken a plea that the Suit is bad for non -joinder of necessary 
party  as the plaintiff has not made Lok -Beta Pharmaceuticals India Limited , 
the entity that issued shares in his favour, a  party to the present Suit . 
6. The second ground for rejection is that the suit is miserably barred by 
limitation . The plaintiff is seeking principal amount of Rs. 44,01,274/ - along 
with interest at the rate of 24%  from 31.03.2009.  The plaintiff as per his 
own averments , has asserted that the cause of action arose in March, 2009, 
but the present Suit had been filed on 27.02.2018 i.e., after a lapse of about  
nine years .  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 3 of 26 
 
7. The plaintiff has also alle ged that he was removed from the 
Directorship of the Company on 24.10.2012. The plaintiff has further 
claimed that the cause of action had also arisen on 23.03.2013, when the 
defendant allegedly admitted to have issued 21,558 shares. Even if the cause 
of action is taken to have arisen in the year 2012 -13 for filing the present 
suit, it would still be barred by limitation. Therefore, the suit is miserably 
barred by limitation.  
8. It is further submitted that the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit 
under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963  as the Company Petition filed 
for the appointment of a Liquidator , was not a petition for recovery.  The 
withdrawal of a Company petition to pursue a remedy of filing a suit for 
recovery, does not satisfy the condition s under Section 14 of the Limitation 
Act, 1963. The words “ or cause of a like nature ” would be required to be 
considered ejusdem generis  with earlier words “ of defect in jurisdiction ”. 
Therefore, where the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Company 
petition, but does not do so, it cannot be said that the Court did not grant the 
application due to defect similar to the want of jurisdiction.  
9. Reliance has been placed on judgements in Narayan Ambaji  Chavan 
vs Hari Ganesh Navare , AIR 1930  Bom 505; Ajab En terprises vs Jayant 
Vegoiles  & Chemicals Pvt. Ltd ., AIR 1991 Bom 35 ; Gurdit Singh &  Ors. vs 
Munsha Singh &  Ors, AIR (1997) SC 640; Yeshwant  Deorao vs Walchand  
Ramchand, 1950 SCR 852 . It is, therefore, submitted that the present Suit is 
liable to be rejected.  
10. The plaintiff in his Reply  to the present application , has averred that  
the Suit for recovery of  Rs. 1,54,10,305/ - is on account of his unlawful 
removal from the Directorship , without adhering to the statutory provisions  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 4 of 26 
 
prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013 and for non -payment of 
committed amount as well as other legitimate dues payable by the 
defendant -Company.  
11. It is stated that the defendant had issued two letters, one dated 
04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006 confirming that  the plaintiff was nominated as 
the Director of the defendant Company  and undertook to issue shares 
equivalent to 3% of the total paid up capital in lieu of the plaintiff’s 
intellectual services to be rendered  to the defendant Company . Accordingly , 
Defendant Company initially issued 4200 numbers of shares until 
31.03.2007 to the Plaintiff which amounted to 0.89 % of the total paid up 
capital at that time. The number of shares were increased to 21558 from 
31.03.2007 to 31.03.2008 which attained the threshold of 3% of the total 
paid up capital . 
12. It is submitted that thereafter, despite an exponential surge in total 
paid up capital of the Defendant, number of shares provided to the Plaintiff 
remained constant. Thus, the total number of shares allotted t o plaintiff 
amounted to 1.77% of the total paid up capital, which the defendant has 
admitted vide its letter dated 23.03.2013. This amounts to a clear admission 
of the unpaid shares.  
13. It is further asserted by the plaintiff that the shares were transferred by 
the defendant under the Certificate of EmProCell Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd. 
and the plaintiff was given an impression that the transfer was a result of 
some internal arrangement . The letter of Appointment dated 08.09.2006 was 
on the letter head of EmProCell Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd , the defendant  
and the letter was issued by the Board of Directors of defendant Company . 
Therefore, t he shares were transferred by the defendant and not by Lok Beta  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 5 of 26 
 
Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd , Mumb ai.Thus, Lok Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) 
Pvt. Ltd , Mumbai is not a necessary or proper  party to the present suit. 
14. With r egard to the cause of action for filing the suit , it is submitted 
that the Suit has been filed on 19.02.2018 for which  the cause of action  
arose on 24.10. 2012 when the plaintiff was illegally removed from his 
Directorship  without giving a Special Notice to him, tarnishing his well 
established reputation among the Biological Sciences fraternity and 
Healthcare Industry.  
15. The cause of action is claimed to have further arisen in March, 2013 
when the defendant Company pointed out that the plaintiff was acting 
against the interests of the defendant Company, when in fact the plaintiff 
was only making the defendant aware of the n egligen ce in comply ing with 
statutory provisions.  
16. Thereafter,  plaintiff had issued Statutory Notice dated 21.11.2015 
under the Companies Act, 2013 to the defendant to either allot the pending 
shares or make payment in lieu the reof. From the data pertaining to 
Financial year 2015 ending on 31.03.2015, the plaintiff calculated that he 
was entitled to get 32,527  more shares which the defendant continuously 
failed to issue or make payment of amount of Rs. 27,92,117/ - in lieu of the 
share s, despite various reminders. It gave a reason to the plaintiff to believe 
that defendant was unable to pay its debts and thus, he filed the Company 
Petition under S ection 271 and Section  272 of the Companies Act,  2013  
before the  Bombay High Court in Janua ry, 2016 . The said Petition was filed 
within the period of three years  as provided under Section 137 of the 
Limitation Act, 1963.  However, the Petition  was withdrawn on 04.08.2017 
with liberty to file a Suit before the competent jurisdiction for recovery of  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 6 of 26 
 
the amount claimed in the present petition.  
17. The plaintiff has assert ed that the petition under Sections 271 and 272 
of the Companies Act, 2013 is a civil proceeding  being a remedy against 
non-payment of legitimate dues coming under the definition of “cause of 
like nature ” and the time spent in pursuing the said Petition before the 
Company Court , is liable to be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation 
Act, 1963. Reliance has been placed on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. v. 
Inspira IT Products (P) Ltd ., 2018 SCC OnLineBom 21382; S.A.L. Narayan 
Row vs. Ishwarlal,  AIR 1965 SC 1818; Ramesh vs. Seth  Gendalal  Motilal  
Patni  1966 SCR (3) 198; M.P. Steel Corporation vs. Commissioner of 
Central Excise  (2015) 7 SCC 58 . 
18. The defendant/ applicant in its rejoinde r has submitted that the 
Company Petition filed by the plaintiff was itself barred by limitation  as the 
limitation period for a Company Petition for winding up , begins from the 
day the debt becomes due . The debt in the present case became due 
immediately on the day shares were offered to the plaintiff , in 2006. Section 
14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 c annot be applied to revive the already 
expired limitation period . 
19. It is further submitted that, though Winding up proceedings are civil 
in nature, it does not satisfy the ingredients under Section 14 of the 
Limitation Act, 1963.  While in the Company Petiti on the plaintiff claimed 
only Rs.27,92,11 7/-, the claim  in the present plaint is  for recovery  of 
Rs.1,54,10,305/. It is submitted that the plaintiff cannot be permitted to raise 
a fresh enhanced claim in the garb of Section 14 of the Limitation Act . The 
suit of the plaintiff is therefore liable to be rejected.  
20. Submissions heard.   
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 7 of 26 
 
Mis-joinder of Necessary Party:  
21. The first ground raised by the defendant for the rejection of the plaint 
is the non-joinder of Lok -Beta Pharmaceuticals, which had been admittedly 
transferred its shares held in  the defendant Company in favour of the 
plaintiff.  
22. Admittedly, the Defendant Company is a Joint Venture between M/s 
Citi Pharm K/s, Copenhagen, Demark and the Lok -Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) 
Pvt. Ltd , Mumbai. It is ap parent that the defendant Company is a separate 
legal entity in which Lok -Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd and M/s Citi 
Pharm K/s were shareholders holding 6.23% and 92.88% shares as on 
31.03.2007. The shares may have been of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals  but 
they were transferred admittedly by the defendant Company as is evident 
from the Covering Letter s dated 04.09.2006  and 08.09.2006 .The defendant 
is a joint venture of Lok -Beta Pharmaceuticals and M/s Citi Pharm K/s . 
Therefore, even though the shares are of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals, i.e.  the 
consideration may be of third party , but it was given by the defendant 
pursuant to the Service contract entered between the parties vide Letter s 
dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006. The claim of the plaintiff would thus, be 
only against the defendant Company, as it was they who promised the 
transfer of shares to the plaintiff. The very fact that the defendant had given 
the shares in performance of a part of its obligation , the privity of contra ct is 
between the plaintiff and the defendant Company . Therefore,  Lok-Beta 
Pharmaceuticals  is neither  a necessary nor proper  party .  
23. This objection taken by the defendant is therefore not tenable.  
 
I. Cause of Action:   
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 8 of 26 
 
24. The other ground on which rejection of suit is sought is that the reliefs 
claimed are barred by Limitation. By way of this Suit, the plaintiff has 
sought the recovery of money in lieu of the shares to which he claims he is 
entitled to, interest on the said  amount , and has sought  compensation for the 
loss of reputation due to the termination of his Directorship. The relief 
prayed by the plaintiff are as under: - 
“a)  Pass a decree for recovery of Rs. 44,01,274/ - 
(Rupees Forty Four Lakhs One Thousand Two Hundred 
and Seventy Four ) in favour of the Plaintiffs and against 
the Defendants;  
 
b)  Pass a decree directing the Defendants to pay interest 
at 24% per annum on the sum equivalent to the balance 
of shares year wise amounting to Rs. 50,09,031/ - till 
31.12 .2017 and till the actual date of payment of the said 
sum by the Defendants;  
 
c)  pass a decree directing the Defendants to pay Plaintiff 
Rs. 60,00,000/ - as compensation for loss of reputation in 
the Biological Science Fraternity and Health Care 
Industry c aused due to his unlawful removal from the 
office of Director;  
 
d)  to award the cost of the proceedings in favour of the 
plaintiff and against the Defendants.”  
 
25. In order to ascertain that whether the cause of action is beyond the 
period of limitation, it would be pertinent to reproduce the relevant 
Paragraphs of the Suit, describing the Cause of Action which are as under: - 
“31.  That the Cause of Action arose in the month of 
June, 2012 when the Defendant Company stopped 
adhering to the guidelines prescrib ed by Government of 
India and further failed to obtain clearance from the  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 9 of 26 
 
agency of the Government of India for use of stem cells 
from fetal sources for clinical testing thereby exposing 
the Company and the Plaintiff to penal action by the 
Health Councils.  
 
32.  That the Cause of Action arose on 23.03.2013 when 
the Defendant in his letter had admitted that the 
Company has issued 21558 shares to the Plaintiff which 
amounts to 1.77% of the total paid up capital of the 
Company as this is discrepant to what was  promised by 
the Defendant vide his letter date 08.09.2006.  
 
33.  That Cause of Action further arose in the month of 
March, 2013 when the Defendant Company pointed out 
that the Plaintiff was acting against the interest of the 
company while the Plaintiff wa s merely making the 
company aware that its negligence to comply with the 
statutory provision may result into serious penalties and 
actions from the Govt.  
 
34.  The Cause of Action also arose when the Plaintiff 
was not served with the Special Notice for his  removal as 
required under sub -Section 3 of Section 284 of the 
Companies Act 1956 (now section 169 of Companies Act, 
2013) and hence was deprived of his legal right under the 
said section to make representation before passing of any 
resolution of his remov al.  
 
35.  The Cause of Action arose on 24.10.2012 when the 
Plaintiff was summarily and unlawfully discharged from 
the office of Director as the same has resulted in a 
serious blot to his reputation among the biological 
sciences fraternity and health care industry.”  
 
26. It is the case of the plaintiff that the cause of action for all the reliefs 
sought by filing the Suit for Recovery, arose on several occasions between 
October, 2012 to March, 2013. For the sake of convenience, the events prior 
to the filing of  present suit has been chronologically tabulated below:

27. The plaintiff has sought the recovery of money in lieu of the shares 
that he is allegedly entitled to in the defendant Company. An offer for shares 
was first made to the plaintiff vide Letter dated 04.09.2006 which reads as 
under:  
 
“Dated: 04/09/2006.

Note: We will send you the second letter on 8th of this month .” 
 
28. Thereafter, as per Letter dated 08.09.2006 , the defendant Company 
decided to issue shares equivalent to 3% of the total share against the  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 12 of 26 
 
plaintiff‟s intellectual services . The relevant part of the letter has been 
reproduced below:  
 
“Dated:08/09/2006.

SUB: Issue of Shares and Appointment of Director in the 
Company:  
 
Dear Dr.Gandhi,  
 This is to inform you that after discussions held with 
Mr.Vladimir  E. Babiy and Mr.Victor  Radchenko who are 
the representatives of shareholders as well as nominated 
Directors of the Company EmPr oCell Research Pvt. Ltd., 
it has been decided to issue you with share equivalent to 
3% of total share in your name against your intellectual 
services.  We believe your association with the Company 
will help the Company to grow in the field desired by us.  
 It has also been unanimously decided to appoint 
you as the Director of the Company  and taking this 
opportunity we would like to invite you as a member in 
the Board of Directors.  
 
 … 
 
On behalf of the Board of Directors  
For EmProCell Research Pvt. Ltd.  
 
 
(ALOK KUMAR)  
DIRECTOR ” 
 
29. The Letters clearly expressed that it “has been decided to issue you 
with share equivalent to 3% of total share in your name against your  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 13 of 26 
 
intellectual services ”. The plaintiff himself has stated in their plaint that 
Defendant Compa ny initially issued 4200 number  of shares in their favour 
until 31.03.2007 , which amounted to 0.89 % of the total paid up capital at 
that time. The number of shares were increased to 21 ,558 from 31.03.2007 
to 31.03.2008 which attained  the threshold of 3% of the total paid up capital. 
It is the admission of the plaintiff himself that the entire agreed 3% of shares 
amounting to 21558 were given to the plaintiff  by 31.03.2008.  
30. Further, the plaintiff relies on a table showing the Pattern  of 
Shareholding from 31.03.2007 to 31.12.2013, in support of his submission 
that he only owned 1.77% of the share s in the defendant Company from 
31.03.2011 to 31.03.2012. The table has been reproduced below:  
 
31.  Pertinently, as per the  plaintiff’s own doc ument showing the 
Pattern of Shareholding from 31.03.2007 to 31.12.2013, the plaintiff was 
admittedly issued 21,558 shares which was 3% of the defendant 
 
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 14 of 26 
 
Company’s fully paid up share capital on 31.03.2008 .  
32. It is apodictic from the letters dated 04.09.2006  and 08.09.2006 that 
the defendant only promised to issue 3% of the Company’s fully paid -up 
share capital and never promised to maintain the said 3% shareholding of 
the plaintiff in its Company.  
33. The plaintiff never  made any grievance thereafter of there being any 
kind of shortfall in allotting the share capital  agreed at 3% in the subsequent 
years .  The plaintiff first resorted to a Company Petition in January, 2016 to 
claim recovery of the alleged amount due in lieu of the alleged balance 
shares  after the termination of his Directorship on 24.10.2012.  
34. Rather, it is his own admission that he received the promised 3% of 
the share capital of the Company in 2008 and thereafter , no grievance was 
raised by the plaintiff till his termination on 24.10.2 012. Clearly, as per the 
admissions of the plaintiff, he had been given 3% share capital in terms of 
his Letter of Engagement .  
35. There was no Agreement between the parties that plaintiff would 
perpetually be entitled to 3% of the defendant Company’s share  capitalas  
calculated annually. Thus, the defendant only promised to issue 3% of the 
Company’s fully paid up share capital and never promised to maintain the 
said 3% shareholding of the plaintiff in its Company. As discussed above, 
neither was this the ter m in the Letter of Appointment dated 08.09.2006 nor 
did the plaintiff ever make any claim for shares as per the annual capital of 
the Company  during his tenure . It is observed that the claim of the plaintiff, 
if accepted,  would lead to an anomalous  situati on; in case the authorised  
capital of the defendant reduced in a given year, would the plaintiff had 
returned the proportionate number of shares for the given number ?  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 15 of 26 
 
36. Clearly, 3% of the Company’s shares were given as one  time 
allotment at the time of Engagement and was not subject to annual 
adjustment . Thereafter, the defendant company may have  enlarged its  
Authorized  Capital through issuance of fresh shares in subsequent years, and 
the present shareholding of the plainti ff may have come down to  1.77% of 
the entire paid up capital ; however,  in light of express terms of the Letter of 
Engagement, the plaintiff is not entitled to any additional allotment of 
shares.  
37. The documents relied upon by the plaintiff coupled with his o wn 
assertions in the plaint , bely his claim for the compensation in lieu of  shares . 
He is neither entitled to any balance shares , nor the amount claimed in lieu 
thereof.  Since 3% of Company’s shares had already been issued in 
favour of the plaintiff as on 31.03.2008 a s reflected  in the Chart and also 
admitted by the plaintiff  in his plaint , there is no cause of action for 
recovery of the amount of Rs .44,01,274/ - on account of alleged deficit 
allotment of shares  under Prayer (a) .  
38. Further, the plaintiff has asserted that a fresh cause of action accrued 
in his favour in view of letters dated 04.01.2013 or 23.03.2013 wherein, the 
defendant Company had allegedly admitted that they had issued 21,558 
shares to the plaintiff which amounts to 1.77%  of the total paid up Cap ital of 
the Company which is discrepant to what was promised by the defendant . 
The relevant part of letter dated 04.01.2013 , which is a Reply to letter dated 
04.01.2012 has been reproduced below:  
“Dear Dr. Gandhi,  
 
Re: Your letter dated January 4, 2012  
  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 16 of 26 
 
… 
 
Please find below our para wise reply to your 
allegations:  
 
1. … In any event as clearly acknowledged by you the 
alleged issue of shares was towards certain intellectual 
services to be rendered by you. The Company has 
already issued 21558 shares to you amounting to 1.77% 
of the total paid up capital of the Company. The 
Company hereby calls upon you to kindly demonstrate 
and produce evidence of the services rendered by you to 
the Company, against which these shares have been 
issued.Furt hermore the Company hereby places on 
record that from 2011 till date you have neither 
rendered any intellectual services to the Company not 
acted in the interest of the Company  and consequently 
the Company is not liable to issue any further shares to 
you a s and by way of sweat equity.  
 
… 
Yours sincerely,  
 
Mr.Vladimir  Babiy  
Director ” 
 
39. Even if it is assumed for the sake of arguments that there was any 
fresh cause of action , it is observed that there is no admission in the letters 
dated 04.01.2013 or 23.03.2013 . The said letters  merely state  that that the 
shareholding of the plaintiff was 1.77% of the  total paid up Share  Capital of 
the defendant  Company . This is a factual statement about the value of the 
shares held by the plaintiff  and cannot be construed  as an admission on the 
entitlement of plaintiff to allotment of more shares. These letters do not 
yield any fresh cause of action in favour of the plaintiff.   
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 17 of 26 
 
40. The Letter dated 04.01. 2013 also does not give a cause of action for 
calculating the limitation.  
 
Limitation for the compensation for deficit share claimed under Prayer 
(a): 
41. The plaintiff has claimed Rs. Rs. 44,01,274/ - in lieu of allotment of 
deficit shares . It has already been held above that there is no cause of action 
for recovery of this amount. H owever, for the sake of arguments even if we 
consider the claim to be tenable, it needs to be further considered whether 
this claim is within limitation.  
42. The residuary provision under Article 113  of the Schedule to the 
Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable t o the present case which states that any 
suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this 
Schedule , the limitation period is three years from when the right to sue 
accrues.  
43. The phrase “ Right to Sue ” was succinctly explained by the Apex 
Court in the case of State of Punjab vs Gurdev Singh , (1991) 4 SCC 1 as 
under:  
“The words ""right to sue"" ordinarily mean the right to 
seek relief by means of legal proceedings. Generally, the 
right to sue accrues only w hen the cause of action arises, 
that is, the right to prosecute to obtain relief by legal 
means. The suit must be instituted when the right 
asserted in the suit is infringed or when there is a clear 
and unequivocal threat to infringe that right by the 
defendant against whom the suit is instituted.”  
 
44. Admittedly, the shares were offered vide letter dated 08.09.2006 and 
the promised 3 % shares were allotted by 31.03. 2008. In case there was any  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 18 of 26 
 
deficit share allotment, it had to be claimed within three years  i.e. upto 
March,  2011 . Even if the assertion of the plaintiff is accepted , that the 
quantum of shares was ascertainable according to the capital of the 
defendant Company at the time of his termination on 24.10.2012 , then too 
the claim is time barred as th e suit has been filed on 19.02.2018  which is 
beyond the period of three years from the date of his termination on 
24.10.2012.  
45. Irrespective of whether cause of action is taken as 31.03 .2008, 
24.10.2012 or 23.03.2013  (the date on which the plaintiff claims t hat a fresh 
cause of action arose), the Claim under Prayer (a) is blatantly barred by 
limitation.  
Limitation for the compensation claimed for illegal Termination, under 
Prayer (c):  
46. A compensation of Rs. 60,00,000/ - has been sought due to the alleged 
unlawful termination of the plaintiff from his position as the Director of the 
defendant Company which allegedly caused attrition to the reputation of the 
plaintiff in the  Biological  Science Fraternity and Health Care Industry.  
47.  The cause of action for the relief against his termination arose on 
24.10.2012 i.e. date of Termination. The compensation for such a discharge 
could have been claimed within three years from 24.10.2012 i.e. upto 
23.10.2015.  
48. The plaintiff however, has sought enlargement of time under S ection 
14 of the Limitation Act , 1963 . The relevant part of Section 14 of the 
Limitation Act, 1963, reads as under: - 
“Section 14. –– Exclusion of time of proceeding bona 
fide in court  without jurisdiction .–––  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 19 of 26 
 
(1) In computing the period of limitation for any suit the 
time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with 
due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a 
court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against th e 
defendant shall be excluded, where the proceeding relates 
to the same matter in issue and is prosecuted in good 
faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other 
cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.”  
 
49. The plaintiff claimed that  he had filed the Winding up petition under 
Section 433 of the Companies Act, 2013 in January , 2016  for recovery of his 
dues and had withdrawn the same on 04.08.2017  and this period is liable to 
be excluded for calculating the limitation period  under Section  14 of the 
Limitation Act .  
Scope of Section 14 of the Limitation Act:  
50. In the case of Suryachakra Power Corpn. Ltd. vs Electricity Deptt.,  
(2016) 16 SCC 152 the Apex Court held that the two main ingredients  for 
attracting the principles under Section 14 of  the Limitation Act, 1963 are 
that the party should be prosecuting another civil proceedings with  due 
diligence  and that the prosecution should be in good faith . Also, it should 
have been returned for defect in jurisdiction or similar defect.  It is not 
enough that one part is satisfied ; both due diligence and good faith must be 
established.  
51. In Consolidated Engg. Enterprises  v. Irrigation Deptt , (2008) 7 SCC 
169 it was explained that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 enables the 
exclusion of the bona fide time spent in a court without jurisdiction. 
Conditions to be satisfied to avail the benefit under Section 14 were 
stipulated as under:   
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 20 of 26 
 
“(1) Both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil 
proceedings prosecuted by the same party ; 
(2) The prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due 
diligence and in good faith ; 
(3) The failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect 
of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature ; 
(4) The earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must 
relate to the same matter in issue ; and  
(5) Both the proceedings are in a court.”  
 
52. From a plain reading of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, it is 
evident that the benefit under the section is available only when the 
proceeding before a wrong Forum results in the return of the plaint or 
withdrawal due to a defect of jurisdiction or such similar defects.  
53. In the case of Narayan Ambaji  Chavan vs. Hari Ganesh Navare  
(supra) , the Bombay High Court held that Section 14  Limitation Act applies 
in cases where the court could not entertain an application due to defects in 
jurisdiction or of similar nature . The court refused  to interfere on the ground 
that another remedy by way of Suit in the said matter was available and in 
such situation,  the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 had not 
been extended.   
 
Nature and Object of a Petition for winding up  in comparison to a Suit for 
Recovery : 
54. In order to avail the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, 
the nature and object of a winding up petition must satisfy the conditions 
specified in Section 14 . 
55. Perspicuously, any prior proceedings initiated must be with respect to 
the same matter in issue in the subsequent proceeding  in order to avail the  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 21 of 26 
 
benefit under  section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 .  
56. The expression 'other cause of like nature ' came up for 
consideration of this Court in Roshanlal  Kuthalia  vs. R.B. Mohan Singh 
Oberoi  (1975) 4 SCC 628 and it was held that Section 14 of the Limitation 
Act is wide enough to cover such cases where the defects are not strictly 
jurisdictional , but so-called  others more or less neighbors  to such 
deficiencies. Any circumstance, legal or factual, which inhibits 
entertainment or consideration by the court of the dispute on the merits 
comes within the scope of the section and a liberal touch must inform the 
interpretation of the Limitation Act which deprives the remedy of one who 
has a right. This interpretation was followed in M.P. Steel Corpor ation  
(supra) and  West Coast Paper Mills Ltd.  (supra).  
57. The counsel for the applicant/ defendant  has relied on t he Bombay 
High Court in Ajab Enterprises  (supra) , wherein it was held that the period 
in purs uing the Company Petition cannot be excluded under Section 14 of 
the Limitation Act, 1963. Even if the plaintiffs were pursuing a remedy of 
winding up proceeding under the Company Law, they ought to have filed 
suit for recovery of the amount due to them within the period of limitation.  
58. On the other hand, t he counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. vs. Inspira IT Products Pvt. Ltd (supra) 
wherein it was observed that there is no legal requirement for the prior 
proceeding to be for the recovery of debt or that the same r elief must be 
claimed in both the proceedings. In any case, a Winding up Petition is also a 
remedy for enforcing payment of a lawful debt as the end result of such 
petition is the winding up of the Company so that the assets and dividends of 
the Company can be declared towards payment of dues. It was also observed  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 22 of 26 
 
that in view of the findings in West Coast  Paper Mills Ltd.  (supra), Ajab 
Enterprises  (supra) is not good law.  
59. The nature and object of a “Company Petition ” under Section s 433 
and 434 has to be analysed in co ntradistinction  to a suit for recovery.  
60. In the case of Rishi Pal Gupta vs S.J. Knitting a nd Furnishing Mills 
Private Limited , 1998 (45) DRJ 522, the maintainability of a Winding up 
petition when a suit for recovery was pending against the Company came up 
for consideration. It was held that a recovery suit and a winding up petition 
serve different purposes. While recovery suit would only serve the 
petitioner, a winding up petition can benefit the shareholders, creditors and 
contributors of the Company as well.  
61. Similarly, in Indo Alusys Industries vs Assotech Contracts (India) Ltd . 
2009 (11 0) DRJ 384, the learned Single Judge of this Court echoed the same 
principal that while a suit for recovery is a proceeding in personam , a 
winding up petition is a proceeding in rem . It was further expounded as 
under:  
“12. So far as the objection that the petitioner has filed a 
suit disentitling it to maintain the present petition is 
concerned, it is well settled that the right to bring a 
winding up action is statutory conferred under Section 
433 of the Companies Act, 1956 . However, no person 
has a statutor y right to winding up of a company 
incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. Action to 
recover amounts and to winding up of the company are 
two wholly distinct and independent remedies.It is not 
necessary that every petition under Section 433 of the 
Comp anies Act, 1956 ends up in an order of winding up.  
Several essential factors as public interest, justice and 
convenience enter into the consideration before the 
prayed for order results. The nature of the defence and  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 23 of 26 
 
extent of dispute raised by the respond ent also impact 
adjudication in winding up action. At the same time , 
limitation for seeking the remedy of recovery against the 
company continues to run.  The two remedies are not 
alternative remedies. More often than not, as a matter of 
abundant caution, pa rties do not wait for final decision in 
one remedy before invoking the other .” 
 
62. The Supreme Court in the case of Gurdit Singh &  Ors. vs. Munsha 
Singh &  Ors. (supra) held that the words “or cause of a like nature”  would 
be required to be considered ejusdem generis with earlier words “of defect 
in jurisdiction”  and, therefore, where the Court had jurisdiction to entertain 
the Company Petition, but does not do so, it cannot be said that the Court did 
not grant the relief due to defect similar to the wa nt of jurisdiction.  
63. Likewise, the Supreme Court in Yeshwant  Deorao (supra) held that 
there can be no exclusion of the period spent in Insolvency proceedings 
against the Judgment Debtor while computing the period of limitation by 
giving the benefit of Secti on 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.  
64. The object of a petition under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 
1956 is to wind up a Company that is unable to clear its debts or fails to 
comply with statutory requirements. It is thus not a typical process for debt 
recovery.  The recovery of the dues or a part of the dues is only incidental to 
the winding up and liquidation of the company . In fact, even the quantum of 
dues recoverable is subject  to the amount raised from the liquidation for 
which the priority of repayment is towards the dues payable to workmen and 
secured creditors as per Section 529A of the Companies Act, 1956.  
65. Therefore, in the event the court d irects  to wind up the Company, 
after the  priority dues are cleared, the plaintiff would  stand a chance to  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 24 of 26 
 
recover his alleged dues in the said petition.  
66. Thus, in a Winding up proceeding , the scope of determination is 
confined to whether the Company is  “unable to pay its debts ”. This issue is 
answered in the affirmative as recovery of the debt is an incidental 
relief that would follow after the winding up of a Compa ny. Thus, 
though, a Court or Tribunal, while adjudicating a Winding up petition 
does not determine the recovery of debts , recovery would be a 
consequence . 
67. Therefore, a suit for recovery and a Winding up Petition are of a 
similar cause  or proceedings of like nature  as Winding up Petition may 
eventually result in recovery of dues . 
68. Thus,  the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusion of period from 
January, 2016 to 04.08.2017 spent in the Winding up proceedings, 
under section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 , but the question is would 
the suit of the plaintiff be still within the Limitation . 
69. As it has been held above, the cause of action with respect to the 
alleged balance shares in the defendant Company that the plaintiff is 
entitled , arose firstly on 08.09.2006  when the shares were agreed to be 
issued to the Plaintiff . It again arose in Marc h 2008 when the promised 3% 
shares were admittedly allotted to him. The grievance of any shortfall arose 
then. Even if the claim of plaintiff is accepted that it finally arose  on his day 
of resignation on 24.10.2012, t he present has been filed only on 19.02.2018. 
Therefore, even if the period of about 20 months  i.e. one and a half 
years from January, 2016 to 04.08.2017 (i.e. the period spent in 
pursuing the Company Petition) is excluded, then too , the present suit is 
barred by limitation , as having been  filed beyond a period of three  
CS(COMM ) 668/2018  Page 25 of 26 
 
years . 
70. Secondly , the Company Petition for the winding up of the defendant 
company was filed only in January , 2016 . The Apex Court in Jignesh Shah 
vs Union of India , (2019) 10 SCC 750  held that though it is clear that a 
winding up proceeding is a proceeding „in rem‟ and not a recovery 
proceeding, the trigger of limitation, so far as the Winding up petition is 
concerned, would be the date of default. Section 137 of the Limitation Act, 
1963 would b e attracted in such cases which provides for a period of three 
years from when the right to apply accrues.  The right to sue for the 
Company Petition also accrued on 24.10.2012 . Therefore, the said 
Company Petition was  also barred by limitation as it has be en filed in 
January, 2016 beyond three years  from the date of default.  
71. Once the Winding Up Petition is itself beyond a period of three years, 
the time spent by the plaintiff in Winding Up Petition, would not save the 
limitation of the plaintiff to recover y of the  claimed  amount. Therefore, even 
if the period during which the plaintiff had persued the Company Petition is 
excluded, the plaintiff would still not be able to bring his suit within the 
period of limitation.  
 
Conclusion:  
72. In view of the foregoing discussions, the two captioned applications 
are allowed, and the present Suit of the plaintiff is hereby rejected, as being 
barred by limitation.  
73. Accordingly, the applications are disposed of in the above terms.

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
I.A. 6003/2021(u/O VII Rule 11 r/w Section 151 of CPC by defendant for rejection of Suit)

I.A. 8685/2021(u/O VII Rule 11 r/w Section 151 of CPC by defendant for rejection of Suit)


1. The present Applications under Order VII Rule 11 read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as CPC, 1908) has been filed on behalf of the applicant/defendant seeking rejection of the Plaint.
2. The case of the plaintiff as stated in his plaint, is that vide Letter of Appointment dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006, the defendant Company which is a Joint Venture between M/s Citi Pharm K/s, Copenhagen, Demark and the Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd Mumbai, offered him 3% shares as intellectual service and Directorship of the Company. Accordingly, he was issued 21,588 shares by Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals Indian Limited (a shareholder of the defendant Company) which amounted to just over 0.888% of the total paid up capital.
3. According to the plaintiff, when he addressed the non-compliance of Governmental and Statutory Rules by the defendant Company with its other members, a Special Notice was issued against him for his removal, as per Section 284 of the Companies Act, 1956 (now section 169 of Companies Act, 2013). However, this Notice was not served to the plaintiff. Thereafter, on 24.10.2012 he was summarily and unlawfully discharged from the office of Directorship that had allegedly harmed his reputation in the industry.
4. The plaintiff thus, filed the present suit for the Recovery of money for the value of 51,273 shares of the defendant Company, as well as a compensation for the loss of reputation suffered due to termination of his Directorship in the defendant Company.
5. The defendant/applicant in the application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC, has taken a plea that the Suit is bad for non-joinder of necessary party as the plaintiff has not made Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals India Limited, the entity that issued shares in his favour, a party to the present Suit.
6. The second ground for rejection is that the suit is miserably barred by limitation. The plaintiff is seeking principal amount of Rs. 44,01,274/- along with interest at the rate of 24%  from 31.03.2009.  The plaintiff as per his own averments, has asserted that the cause of action arose in March, 2009, but the present Suit had been filed on 27.02.2018 i.e., after a lapse of about nine years.
7. The plaintiff has also alleged that he was removed from the Directorship of the Company on 24.10.2012. The plaintiff has further claimed that the cause of action had also arisen on 23.03.2013, when the defendant allegedly admitted to have issued 21,558 shares. Even if the cause of action is taken to have arisen in the year 2012-13 for filing the present suit, it would still be barred by limitation. Therefore, the suit is miserably barred by limitation.
8. It is further submitted that the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 as the Company Petition filed for the appointment of a Liquidator, was not a petition for recovery. The withdrawal of a Company petition to pursue a remedy of filing a suit for recovery, does not satisfy the conditions under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The words or cause of a like nature would be required to be considered ejusdem generis with earlier words of defect in jurisdiction. Therefore,where the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Company petition, but does not do so, it cannot be said that the Court did not grant the application due to defect similar to the want of jurisdiction.
9. Reliance has been placed on judgements in Narayan Ambaji Chavan vs Hari Ganesh Navare, AIR 1930 Bom 505; Ajab Enterprises vs Jayant Vegoiles & Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., AIR 1991 Bom 35; Gurdit Singh & Ors. vs Munsha Singh & Ors, AIR (1997) SC 640; Yeshwant Deorao vs Walchand Ramchand,1950 SCR 852. It is, therefore, submitted that the present Suit is liable to be rejected. 
10. The plaintiff in his Reply to the present application, has averred that the Suit for recovery of Rs. 1,54,10,305/- is on account of his unlawful removal from the Directorship, without adhering to the statutory provisions prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013 and for non-payment of committed amount as well as other legitimate dues payable by the defendant-Company. 
11. It is stated that the defendant had issued two letters, one dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006 confirming that the plaintiff was nominated as the Director of the defendant Company and undertook to issue shares equivalent to 3% of the total paid up capital in lieu of the plaintiffs intellectual services to be rendered to the defendant Company. Accordingly, Defendant Company initially issued 4200 numbers of shares until 31.03.2007 to the Plaintiff which amounted to 0.89 % of the total paid up capital at that time. The number of shares were increased to 21558 from 31.03.2007 to 31.03.2008 which attained the threshold of 3% of the total paid up capital.
12. It is submitted that thereafter, despite an exponential surge in total paid up capital of the Defendant, number of shares provided to the Plaintiff remained constant. Thus, the total number of shares allotted to plaintiff amounted to 1.77% of the total paid up capital, which the defendant has admitted vide its letter dated 23.03.2013. This amounts to a clear admission of the unpaid shares.
13. It is further asserted by the plaintiff that the shares were transferred by the defendant under the Certificate of EmProCell Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd. and the plaintiff was given an impression that the transfer was a result of some internal arrangement. The letter of Appointment dated 08.09.2006 was on the letter head of EmProCell Clinical Research Pvt. Ltd, the defendant and the letter was issued by the Board of Directors of defendant Company. Therefore, the shares were transferred by the defendant and not by Lok Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai.Thus, Lok Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai is not a necessary or proper party to the present suit.
14. With regard to the cause of action for filing the suit, it is submitted that the Suit has been filed on 19.02.2018 for which the cause of action arose on 24.10.2012 when the plaintiff was illegally removed from his Directorship without giving a Special Notice to him, tarnishing his well established reputation among the Biological Sciences fraternity and Healthcare Industry.
15. The cause of action is claimed to have further arisen in March, 2013 when the defendant Company pointed out that the plaintiff was acting against the interests of the defendant Company, when in fact the plaintiff was only making the defendant aware of the negligence in complying with statutory provisions.
16. Thereafter, plaintiff had issued Statutory Notice dated 21.11.2015 under the Companies Act, 2013 to the defendant to either allot the pending shares or make payment in lieu thereof. From the data pertaining to Financial year 2015 ending on 31.03.2015, the plaintiff calculated that he was entitled to get 32,527 more shares which the defendant continuously failed to issue or make payment of amount of Rs. 27,92,117/- in lieu of the shares, despite various reminders. It gave a reason to the plaintiff to believe that defendant was unable to pay its debts and thus, he filed the Company Petition under Section 271 and Section 272 of the Companies Act, 2013 before the Bombay High Court in January, 2016. The said Petition was filed within the period of three years as provided under Section 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.  However, the Petition was withdrawn on 04.08.2017 with liberty to file a Suit before the competent jurisdiction for recovery of the amount claimed in the present petition. 
17. The plaintiff has asserted that the petition under Sections 271 and 272 of the Companies Act, 2013 is a civil proceeding being a remedy against non-payment of legitimate dues coming under the definition of cause of like nature and the time spent in pursuing the said Petition before the Company Court, is liable to be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Reliancehas been placed on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. v. Inspira IT Products (P) Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLineBom 21382; S.A.L. Narayan Row vs. Ishwarlal, AIR 1965 SC 1818; Ramesh vs. Seth Gendalal Motilal Patni 1966 SCR (3) 198; M.P. Steel Corporation vs. Commissioner of Central Excise (2015) 7 SCC 58.
18. The defendant/applicant in its rejoinder has submitted that the Company Petition filed by the plaintiff was itself barred by limitation as the limitation period for a Company Petition for winding up, begins from the day the debt becomes due. The debt in the present case became due immediately on the day shares were offered to the plaintiff, in 2006.Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 cannot be applied to revive the already expired limitation period.
19. It is further submitted that, though Winding up proceedings are civil in nature, it does not satisfy the ingredients under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. While in the Company Petition the plaintiff claimed only Rs.27,92,117/-, the claim in the present plaint is for recovery  of Rs.1,54,10,305/. It is submitted that the plaintiff cannot be permitted to raise a fresh enhanced claim in the garb of Section 14 of the Limitation Act. The suit of the plaintiff is therefore liable to be rejected.
20. Submissions heard.
Mis-joinder of Necessary Party:
21. The first ground raised by the defendant for the rejection of the plaint is the non-joinder of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals, which had been admittedly transferred its shares held in the defendant Company in favour of the plaintiff. 
22. Admittedly, the Defendant Company is a Joint Venture between M/s Citi Pharm K/s, Copenhagen, Demark and the Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai. It is apparent that the defendant Company is a separate legal entity in which Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals (I) Pvt. Ltd and M/s Citi Pharm K/s were shareholders holding 6.23% and 92.88% shares as on 31.03.2007. The shares may have been of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals but they were transferred admittedly by the defendant Company as is evident from the Covering Letters dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006.The defendant is a joint venture of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals and M/s Citi Pharm K/s. Therefore, even though the shares are of Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals, i.e. the consideration may be of third party, but it was given by the defendant pursuant to the Service contract entered between the parties vide Letters dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006.The claim of the plaintiff would thus, be only against the defendant Company, as it was they who promised the transfer of shares to the plaintiff. The very fact that the defendant had given the shares in performance of a part of its obligation, the privity of contract is between the plaintiff and the defendant Company. Therefore, Lok-Beta Pharmaceuticals is neither a necessary nor proper party. 
23. This objection taken by the defendant is therefore not tenable.

I. Cause of Action:
24. The other ground on which rejection of suit is sought is that the reliefs claimed are barred by Limitation. By way of this Suit, the plaintiff has sought the recovery of money in lieu of the shares to which he claims he is entitled to, interest on the said amount, and has sought compensation for the loss of reputation due to the termination of his Directorship.The relief prayed by the plaintiff are as under: -
a)  Pass a decree for recovery of Rs. 44,01,274/- (Rupees Forty Four Lakhs One Thousand Two Hundred and Seventy Four ) in favour of the Plaintiffs and against the Defendants;

b)  Pass a decree directing the Defendants to pay interest at 24% per annum on the sum equivalent to the balance of shares year wise amounting to Rs. 50,09,031/- till 31.12.2017 and till the actual date of payment of the said sum by the Defendants;

c)  pass a decree directing the Defendants to pay Plaintiff Rs. 60,00,000/- as compensation for loss of reputation in the Biological Science Fraternity and Health Care Industry caused due to his unlawful removal from the office of Director;

d)  to award the cost of the proceedings in favour of the plaintiff and against the Defendants.

25. In order to ascertain that whether the cause of action is beyond the period of limitation, it would be pertinent to reproduce the relevant Paragraphs of the Suit, describing the Cause of Action which are as under: -
31.  That the Cause of Action arose in the month of June, 2012 when the Defendant Company stopped adhering to the guidelines prescribed by Government of India and further failed to obtain clearance from the agency of the Government of India for use of stem cells from fetal sources for clinical testing thereby exposing the Company and the Plaintiff to penal action by the Health Councils.

32.  That the Cause of Action arose on 23.03.2013 when the Defendant in his letter had admitted that the Company has issued 21558 shares to the Plaintiff which amounts to 1.77% of the total paid up capital of the Company as this is discrepant to what was promised by the Defendant vide his letter date 08.09.2006.

33.  That Cause of Action further arose in the month of March, 2013 when the Defendant Company pointed out that the Plaintiff was acting against the interest of the company while the Plaintiff was merely making the company aware that its negligence to comply with the statutory provision may result into serious penalties and actions from the Govt.

34.  The Cause of Action also arose when the Plaintiff was not served with the Special Notice for his removal as required under sub-Section 3 of Section 284 of the Companies Act 1956 (now section 169 of Companies Act, 2013) and hence was deprived of his legal right under the said section to make representation before passing of any resolution of his removal. 

35.  The Cause of Action arose on 24.10.2012 when the Plaintiff was summarily and unlawfully discharged from the office of Director as the same has resulted in a serious blot to his reputation among the biological sciences fraternity and health care industry.

(ALOK KUMAR)
DIRECTOR

29. The Letters clearly expressed that it has been decided to issue you with share equivalent to 3% of total share in your name against your intellectual services. The plaintiff himself has stated in their plaint that Defendant Company initially issued 4200 number of shares in their favour until 31.03.2007, which amounted to 0.89 % of the total paid up capital at that time. The number of shares were increased to 21,558 from 31.03.2007 to 31.03.2008 which attained the threshold of 3% of the total paid up capital. It is the admission of the plaintiff himself that the entire agreed 3% of shares amounting to 21558 were given to the plaintiff  by 31.03.2008. 
30. Further, the plaintiff relies on a table showing the Pattern of Shareholding from 31.03.2007 to 31.12.2013, in support of his submission that he only owned 1.77% of the shares in the defendant Company from 31.03.2011 to 31.03.2012. The table has been reproduced below: 

31.  Pertinently, as per the plaintiffs own document showing the Pattern of Shareholding from 31.03.2007 to 31.12.2013, the plaintiff was admittedly issued 21,558 shares which was 3% of the defendant Companys fully paid up share capital on 31.03.2008. 
32. It is apodictic from the letters dated 04.09.2006 and 08.09.2006 that the defendant only promised to issue 3% of the Companys fully paid-up share capital and never promised to maintain the said 3% shareholding of the plaintiff in its Company. 
33. The plaintiff never made any grievance thereafter of there being any kind of shortfall in allotting the share capital agreed at 3% in the subsequent years.  The plaintiff first resorted to a Company Petition in January, 2016 to claim recovery of the alleged amount due in lieu of the alleged balance shares after the termination of his Directorship on 24.10.2012. 
34. Rather, it is his own admission that he received the promised 3% of the share capital of the Company in 2008 and thereafter, no grievance was raised by the plaintiff till his termination on 24.10.2012. Clearly, as per the admissions of the plaintiff, he had been given 3% share capital in terms of his Letter of Engagement. 
35. There was no Agreement between the parties that plaintiff would perpetually be entitled to 3% of the defendant Companys share capitalas calculated annually. Thus, the defendant only promised to issue 3% of the Companys fully paid up share capital and never promised to maintain the said 3% shareholding of the plaintiff in its Company. As discussed above, neither was this the term in the Letter of Appointment dated 08.09.2006 nor did the plaintiff ever make any claim for shares as per the annual capital of the Company during his tenure. It is observed that the claim of the plaintiff, if accepted, would lead to an anomalous situation; in case the authorised capital of the defendant reduced in a given year, would the plaintiff had returned the proportionate number of shares for the given number?
36. Clearly, 3% of the Companys shares were given as one time allotment at the time of Engagement and was not subject to annual adjustment. Thereafter, the defendant company may have enlarged its Authorized Capital through issuance of fresh shares in subsequent years, and the present shareholding of the plaintiff may have come down to 1.77% of the entire paid up capital; however, in light of express terms of the Letter of Engagement, the plaintiff is not entitled to any additional allotment of shares.
37. The documents relied upon by the plaintiff coupled with his own assertions in the plaint, bely his claim for the compensation in lieu of shares. He is neither entitled to any balance shares, nor the amount claimed in lieu thereof. Since 3% of Companys shares had already been issued in favour of the plaintiff as on 31.03.2008 as reflected in the Chart and also admitted by the plaintiff in his plaint, there is no cause of action for recovery of the amount of Rs.44,01,274/- on account of alleged deficit allotment of shares under Prayer (a). 
38. Further, the plaintiff has asserted that a fresh cause of action accrued in his favour in view of letters dated 04.01.2013 or 23.03.2013 wherein, the defendant Company had allegedly admitted that they had issued 21,558 shares to the plaintiff which amounts to 1.77% of the total paid up Capital of the Company which is discrepant to what was promised by the defendant. The relevant part of letter dated 04.01.2013, which is a Reply to letter dated 04.01.2012 has been reproduced below:
Dear Dr. Gandhi,

Re:	Your letter dated January 4, 2012



Please find below our para wise reply to your allegations:

1.  In any event as clearly acknowledged by you the alleged issue of shares was towards certain intellectual services to be rendered by you. The Company has already issued 21558 shares to you amounting to 1.77% of the total paid up capital of the Company.The Company hereby calls upon you to kindly demonstrate and produce evidence of the services rendered by you to the Company, against which these shares have been issued.Furthermore the Company hereby places on record that from 2011 till date you have neither rendered any intellectual services to the Company not acted in the interest of the Company and consequently the Company is not liable to issue any further shares to you as and by way of sweat equity.


Yours sincerely,

Mr.Vladimir Babiy
Director

39. Even if it is assumed for the sake of arguments that there was any fresh cause of action, it is observed that there is no admission in the letters dated 04.01.2013or 23.03.2013. The said letters merely state that that the shareholding of the plaintiff was 1.77% of the total paid up Share Capital of the defendant Company. This is a factual statement about the value of the shares held by the plaintiff and cannot be construed as an admission on the entitlement of plaintiff to allotment of more shares. These letters do not yield any fresh cause of action in favour of the plaintiff. 
40. The Letter dated 04.01.2013 also does not give a cause of action for calculating the limitation.

Limitation for the compensation for deficit share claimed under Prayer (a):
41. The plaintiff has claimed Rs. Rs. 44,01,274/- in lieu of allotment of deficit shares. It has already been held above that there is no cause of action for recovery of this amount. However, for the sake of arguments even if we consider the claim to be tenable, it needs to be further considered whether this claim is within limitation. 
42. The residuary provision under Article 113 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable to the present case which states that any suit for which no period of limitation is provided elsewhere in this Schedule, the limitation period is three years from when the right to sue accrues.
43. The phrase Right to Sue was succinctly explained by the Apex Court in the case of State of Punjab vs Gurdev Singh, (1991) 4 SCC 1 as under:
The words ""right to sue"" ordinarily mean the right to seek relief by means of legal proceedings. Generally, the right to sue accrues only when the cause of action arises, that is, the right to prosecute to obtain relief by legal means. The suit must be instituted when the right asserted in the suit is infringed or when there is a clear and unequivocal threat to infringe that right by the defendant against whom the suit is instituted.

44. Admittedly, the shares were offered vide letter dated 08.09.2006 and the promised 3% shares were allotted by 31.03.2008. In case there was any deficit share allotment, it had to be claimed within three years i.e. upto March, 2011. Even if the assertion of the plaintiff is accepted, that the quantum of shares was ascertainable according to the capital of the defendant Company at the time of his termination on 24.10.2012, then too the claim is time barred as the suit has been filed on 19.02.2018 which is beyond the period of three years from the date of his termination on 24.10.2012.
45. Irrespective of whether cause of action is taken as 31.03.2008, 24.10.2012 or 23.03.2013 (the date on which the plaintiff claims that a fresh cause of action arose), the Claim under Prayer (a) is blatantly barred by limitation.
Limitation for the compensation claimed for illegal Termination, under Prayer (c):
46. A compensation of Rs. 60,00,000/- has been sought due to the alleged unlawful termination of the plaintiff from his position as the Director of the defendant Company which allegedly caused attrition to the reputation of the plaintiff in the  Biological Science Fraternity and Health Care Industry.
47.  The cause of action for the relief against his termination arose on 24.10.2012 i.e. date of Termination. The compensation for such a discharge could have been claimed within three years from 24.10.2012 i.e. upto 23.10.2015. 
48. The plaintiff however, has sought enlargement of time under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. The relevant part of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, reads as under: -
Section 14. Exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in court without jurisdiction.
(1) In computing the period of limitation for any suit the time during which the plaintiff has been prosecuting with due diligence another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance or of appeal or revision, against the defendant shall be excluded, where the proceeding relates to the same matter in issue and is prosecuted in good faith in a court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, is unable to entertain it.

49. The plaintiff claimed that he had filed the Winding up petition under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 2013 in January, 2016 for recovery of his dues and had withdrawn the same on 04.08.2017 and this period is liable to be excluded for calculating the limitation period under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. 
Scope of Section 14 of the Limitation Act:
50. In the case of Suryachakra Power Corpn. Ltd. vs Electricity Deptt., (2016) 16 SCC 152 the Apex Court held that thetwo main ingredients  for attracting the principles under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 are that the party should be prosecuting another civil proceedings with due diligence and that the prosecution should be in good faith. Also, it should have been returned for defect in jurisdiction or similar defect. It is not enough that one part is satisfied; both due diligence and good faith must be established.
51. In Consolidated Engg. Enterprises v. Irrigation Deptt, (2008) 7 SCC 169 it was explained that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 enables the exclusion of the bonafide time spent in a court without jurisdiction. Conditions to be satisfied to avail the benefit under Section 14 were stipulated as under:
(1) Both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party;
(2) The prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith;
(3) The failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature;
(4) The earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue; and
(5) Both the proceedings are in a court.

52. From a plain reading of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, it is evident that the benefit under the section is available only when the proceeding before a wrong Forum results in the return of the plaint or withdrawal due to a defect of jurisdiction or such similar defects. 
53. In the case of Narayan Ambaji Chavan vs. Hari Ganesh Navare (supra), the Bombay High Court held that Section 14 Limitation Act applies in cases where the court could not entertain an application due to defects in jurisdiction or of similar nature. The court refused to interfere on the ground that another remedy by way of Suit in the said matter was available and in such situation, the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 had not been extended.  

Nature and Object of a Petition for winding up in comparison to a Suit for Recovery:
54. In order to avail the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the nature and object of a winding up petition must satisfy the conditions specified in Section 14.
55. Perspicuously, any prior proceedings initiated must be with respect to the same matter in issue in the subsequent proceeding in order to avail the benefit under section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. 
56. The expression 'other cause of like nature' came up for consideration of this Court in Roshanlal Kuthalia vs. R.B. Mohan Singh Oberoi (1975) 4 SCC 628 and it was held that Section 14 of the Limitation Act is wide enough to cover such cases where the defects are not strictly jurisdictional, but so-called others more or less neighbors to such deficiencies. Any circumstance, legal or factual, which inhibits entertainment or consideration by the court of the dispute on the merits comes within the scope of the section and a liberal touch must inform the interpretation of the Limitation Act which deprives the remedy of one who has a right. This interpretation was followed in M.P. Steel Corporation (supra) and West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (supra).
57. The counsel for the applicant/ defendant has relied on the Bombay High Court in Ajab Enterprises (supra), wherein it was held that the period in pursuing the Company Petition cannot be excluded under Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. Even if the plaintiffs were pursuing a remedy of winding up proceeding under the Company Law, they ought to have filed suit for recovery of the amount due to them within the period of limitation.
58. On the other hand, the counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. vs. Inspira IT Products Pvt. Ltd(supra) wherein it was observed that there is no legal requirement for the prior proceeding to be for the recovery of debt or that the same relief must be claimed in both the proceedings. In any case, a Winding up Petition is also a remedy for enforcing payment of a lawful debt as the end result of such petition is the winding up of the Company so that the assets and dividends of the Company can be declared towards payment of dues. It was also observed that in view of the findings in West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (supra), Ajab Enterprises (supra) is not good law. 
59. The nature and object of a Company Petition under Sections 433 and 434 has to be analysed in contradistinction to a suit for recovery.
60. In the case of Rishi Pal Gupta vs S.J. Knitting and Furnishing Mills Private Limited, 1998 (45) DRJ 522, the maintainability of a Winding up petition when a suit for recovery was pending against the Company came up for consideration. It was held that a recovery suit and a winding up petition serve different purposes. While recovery suit would only serve the petitioner, a winding up petition can benefit the shareholders, creditors and contributors of the Company as well.
61. Similarly, in Indo Alusys Industries vs Assotech Contracts (India) Ltd. 2009 (110) DRJ 384, the learned Single Judge of this Court echoed the same principal that while a suit for recovery is a proceeding in personam, a winding up petition is a proceeding in rem. It was further expounded as under:
12. So far as the objection that the petitioner has filed a suit disentitling it to maintain the present petition is concerned, it is well settled that the right to bring a winding up action is statutory conferred under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956. However, no person has a statutory right to winding up of a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. Action to recover amounts and to winding up of the company are two wholly distinct and independent remedies.It is not necessary that every petition under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956 ends up in an order of winding up. Several essential factors as public interest, justice and convenience enter into the consideration before the prayed for order results. The nature of the defence and extent of dispute raised by the respondent also impact adjudication in winding up action. At the same time, limitation for seeking the remedy of recovery against the company continues to run. The two remedies are not alternative remedies. More often than not, as a matter of abundant caution, parties do not wait for final decision in one remedy before invoking the other.

62. The Supreme Court in the case of Gurdit Singh & Ors. vs. Munsha Singh & Ors. (supra) held that the words or cause of a like nature would be required to be considered ejusdem generis with earlier words of defect in jurisdiction and, therefore, where the Court had jurisdiction to entertain the Company Petition, but does not do so, it cannot be said that the Court did not grant the relief due to defect similar to the want of jurisdiction. 
63. Likewise, the Supreme Court in Yeshwant Deorao(supra) held that there can be no exclusion of the period spent in Insolvency proceedings against the Judgment Debtor while computing the period of limitation by giving the benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963. 
64. The object of a petition under Section 433 of the Companies Act, 1956 is to wind up a Company that is unable to clear its debts or fails to comply with statutory requirements. It is thus not a typical process for debt recovery. The recovery of the dues or a part of the dues is only incidental to the winding up and liquidation of the company. In fact, even the quantum of dues recoverable is subject to the amount raised from the liquidation for which the priority of repayment is towards the dues payable to workmen and secured creditors as per Section 529A of the Companies Act, 1956. 
65. Therefore, in the event the court directs to wind up the Company, after the priority dues are cleared, the plaintiff would stand a chance to recover his alleged dues in the said petition. 
66. Thus, in a Winding up proceeding, the scope of determination is confined to whether the Company is unable to pay its debts. This issue is answered in the affirmative as recovery of the debt is an incidental relief that would follow after the winding up of a Company. Thus, though, a Court or Tribunal, while adjudicating a Winding up petition does not determine the recovery of debts, recovery would be a consequence.
67. Therefore, a suit for recovery and a Winding up Petition are of a similar cause or proceedings of like nature as Winding up Petition may eventually result in recovery of dues.
68. Thus, the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusion of period from January, 2016 to 04.08.2017 spent in the Winding up proceedings, under section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, but the question is would the suit of the plaintiff be still within the Limitation.
69. As it has been held above, the cause of action with respect to the alleged balance shares in the defendant Company that the plaintiff is entitled, arose firstly on 08.09.2006 when the shares were agreed to be issued to the Plaintiff. It again arose in March 2008 when the promised 3% shares were admittedly allotted to him. The grievance of any shortfall arose then. Even if the claim of plaintiff is accepted that it finally arose on his day of resignation on 24.10.2012, the present has been filed only on 19.02.2018. Therefore, even if the period of about 20 months i.e. one and a half years from January, 2016 to 04.08.2017 (i.e. the period spent in pursuing the Company Petition) is excluded, then too, the present suit is barred by limitation, as having been filed beyond a period of three years.
70. Secondly, the Company Petition for the winding up of the defendant company was filed only in January, 2016. The Apex Court in Jignesh Shah vs Union of India, (2019) 10 SCC 750 held that though it is clear that a winding up proceeding is a proceeding in rem and not a recovery proceeding, the trigger of limitation, so far as the Winding up petition is concerned, would be the date of default. Section 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be attracted in such cases which provides for a period of three years from when the right to apply accrues. The right to sue for the Company Petition also accrued on 24.10.2012. Therefore, the said Company Petition was also barred by limitation as it has been filed in January, 2016 beyond three years from the date of default. 
71. Once the Winding Up Petition is itself beyond a period of three years, the time spent by the plaintiff in Winding Up Petition, would not save the limitation of the plaintiff to recovery of the claimed amount. Therefore, even if the period during which the plaintiff had persued the Company Petition is excluded, the plaintiff would still not be able to bring his suit within the period of limitation. 

Conclusion:
72. In view of the foregoing discussions, the two captioned applications are allowed, and the present Suit of the plaintiff is hereby rejected, as being barred by limitation. 
73. Accordingly, the applications are disposed of in the above terms.
CS(COMM) 668/2018 & I.As. 4317/2021, 6002/2021, 7829/2021, 8684/2021, 17520/2022, 15042/2023

74. In view of the Order passed in I.As. 6003/2021 and 8685/2021, the present Suit is hereby rejected, as being barred by limitation. 
75. The pending applications are also dismissed.

7. It is submitted that there were seven distillation plants (P -01 to  P -07) 
installed in t he manufacturing unit of the plaintiff/Company.  All the plants 
i.e., P -01 to P -07, except P -04 were in operation on 30.05.2014. At about  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 3 of 16 
 
05:00 PM, one of the Engineers noticed that the upper part of the Column of 
the plants i.e., P -01 to P -05, w ere leanin g towards the Property bearing No. 
C-17, SMA Industrial Estate due to severe squall/storm and within the 
minutes, the Columns along with the structure started falling towards the 
building of another factory at C -17, SMA Industrial Estate.  
8. The Engineer als o noticed a fire in the Columns and Vessels , and the 
Fire Department was intimated accordingly. The entire factory area was 
evacuated and as an additional precautionary measur e, the staff and workers 
were shifted out of the factory premises.  
9. The plaintiff on the next day itself i.e. on 31.05.2014 informed both 
the Insurance Companies  about the loss suffered by it due to the 
squall/storm on 30.05.2014.  
10. The defendant /Insurance Company  appointed M/s Cunningham & 
Lindsey International Insurance S urveyors and Loss Assessors Private 
Limited , who visited the site on 02.06.2014 for inspect ion to make an 
assessment of  the loss es caused to the stock .  
11. The other Insurance Company i.e., Universal Sompo General 
Insurance Company  appointed Mr. B.I. Subramani am as Surveyors to 
conduct the survey and assess the loss . 
12. The plaintiff/Company lodged a claim of Rs. 18,00,00,000/ - with the 
defendant for the loss of 12,090.21 Kgs. of CIS -3 Hexenol, Terpene cut in 
the distillation plants i.e., P -01 to P -03 and P -05  du e to squall/storm and 
fire. All the requisite documents, details and data were provided to the 
Surveyors.   
13. Mr. I.B. Subramanian, Surveyor appointed by the Universal Sompo 
General Insurance Company Limited , quantified the total loss of stock of  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 4 of 16 
 
CIS-3 Hexenol Terpene cut in the distillation in the aforesaid plants as 
12,090 Kgs. and assessed  the value of the  stocks at Rs. 15,01,66,7 83/-. 
After factoring 1/3rd proportionate share of Universal Sompo  General 
Insurance Company Limited, assessed its liability at Rs. 5,00,55,594/ - for 
the loss of stock.  
14. On the other hand, Mr. Anil Dhingra, Director of Cunningham 
Lindsey, while assessing the loss, wrongly formed an opinion that 12,090.21 
Kgs. of CIS cut in the distillation plants P -01 to P -03 and P -05 was “work in 
process”  (WIP ) and was not covered under the Insurance Policy as the 
Cover Note provided the coverage on “raw material, finished and                 
semi -finished goods  etc. and/or all other pac king material whilst stored 
and/or lying in the insured‟s factory” . 
15. The plaintiff has submitted that it tried to explain to Mr. Anil Dhingra 
that all the stocks and packing material whilst stored or lying in its factory 
premises in whatever form , were cove red under the Insurance Policy taken 
from the defendant /Company . 
16. The plaintiff further explained that it was maintain ing three types of 
inventory of stocks i.e., raw material, work in process (WIP) and finished 
goods . As per its Balance Sheet and in common parlance of the industry, 
semi -furnished goods are considered as WIP and the terms are used 
interchangeably . The plaintiff  had been declaring WIP to the Banker for all 
stocks excluding raw material and finished goods.  
17. However, Mr. Anil Dhin gra, Director of Cunningham Lindsey issued 
the Final Report dated 27.11.2014 by incorrectly  observing that the loss of 
12,090 Kgs. CIS -3 Hexenol Terpene of the affected premises was not 
covered under the Insurance Policy.  Mr. Dhingra, committed a grave er ror  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 5 of 16 
 
by failing to consider that   semi -finished goods are goods at intermediate 
stage between raw material and finished goods.   
18. The defendant, in a mechanical manner, without any justifiable reason 
repudiated the claim of the plaintiff vide Letter dated 23.12.2014 on  the 
pretext that the damaged stocks were undergoing process and thus, were not 
covered under the Insurance Policy.  The relevant portion of the Letter dated 
23.12.2014 reads as under: - 
“Now we are in receipt of  their Final Repor t of M/s 
Cunningham  Lindsey. In their report the Surveyor have given 
the following  observations:  
 
“The Policy provides coverage on ""Raw Material, Finished and  
semi finished goods etc and/or all other essential packing  
material sto red and/or lying in the In sured‟ s factory ”. 
 
The damaged material is neither Raw Material, finished or 
Semi  Finished Goods etc and/or all other essential packing 
material, it  is „Work -in-Process‟  as it was material within the 
plant,  undergoing processing/finishing etc. In the present case, 
it was  heated material undergoing extraction of cis cut.  
 
Since the loss/damage of stock undergoing process in not  
covered under the policy, hence the loss is not found tenable 
and accordingly your cla im has been closed as “NO CLAIM”.  
The inconvenience cause to you is deeply regretted ”. 
 
19. The plaintiff vide its Letter dated 14.07.2016 and followed by many 
other representations , requested the defendant to re -examine and reassess its 
claim, but the defendant had failed to consider the requests of  the plaintiff , 
constraining it to serve the Legal Notice dated 08.11.2017 upon the 
defendant making a claim for Rs. 13,47,03,033/ -. However, despite service 
of the said Legal Notice, the amount has yet not been paid.   
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 6 of 16 
 
20. Hence, the present Suit has been filed for recovery of Rs. 
10,01,11,189/ - as the loss suffered due to the damage caused to the stocks by 
the fire in the factory premises, in addition to Rs. 3,57,10,895/ - towards the 
interest for the period 23.12.2014 till 12.12.2017 and pendente lite  and 
future interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of the Suit till 
realisation.   
21. The defendant was served on 27.02 .2018, but it failed to file the 
Written Statement  and the right to file the same was closed on 10.10.2018.  
22. The plaintiff examined PW1 /Dr. Kamal Kumar, Vice -President of the 
plaintiff/Company to prove its assertion.   
23. PW2 /Ved Kumar Jain,  Charted Accountant, who is an expert, deposed 
that there is no difference between the work in progress or WIP and                
semi -finished goods.   
24. PW3 /Bhagwati I. Subramaniam, who was appointed as the Surveyor 
by Universal Sompo General Insurance Company had given his Report,  Ex. 
PW1/5.  
25. PW1/Dr. Kamal Kumar and PW3/Bhagwati I. Subramanian were not 
cross -examined, while PW2/Ved Kumar Jain was cross -examined on behalf 
of the defendant.  
26. Learned counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has argued  that                    
semi -finished goods and Work in Progress  are interchangeable terms as is 
also proved from the testimony of PW2/Ved  Kumar Jain, Charted 
Accountant. Therefore, the  claim of the plaintiff had been wrongly 
repudiated by the defendant and the said amount is liable to be paid to the 
plaintiff.    
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 7 of 16 
 
27. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the decisions 
in Texco  Marketing Pvt. Ltd. vs. Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd. and 
Ors. (2023) 15 SCC 428 and Schedule III, Division I, Financial Statements 
for a Company whose financial Statements are required to comply with the 
Companies (Accounting Standard) Rules, 2006 . 
28. Learned counsel on behalf of the defendant, however, has 
vehemently argued that in Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy 
Schedule, it has been clearly stated that risk cover was in support of the 
stocks of raw material, finished and semi -finishe d goods. As per the 
statements in documents of the plaintiff/Company itself, the goods were 
described as Work in Progress  and did not qualify as semi -finished goods 
which alone along with raw material and finished material were insured 
under the Insurance P olicy. The claim of the plaintiff/Company has been 
rightly repudiated and the present Suit is liable to be dismissed.  
29. Submissions heard  and the record perused .  
30. It is an admitted fact that the plaintiff had taken the Standard Fire &  
Special Perils Insurance Policy from the defendant/Insurance Company for 
which a Provisional Cover Note dated 07.05.2014 bearing No. 117305Ex. 
PW-1/4 followed by  Policy bearing No. 271400/11/2014/2019 covering risk 
from 08.05.2013 to 07.05.2014 Ex. PW -1/5 was issued. It was followed  for 
the subsequent year by the Insurance Policy bearing No. 
271400/400/11/2015/521 covering risk from 08.05.2014 to 07.05.2015 . 
31. It is also not denied that Delhi and the neighbour ing States witnessed 
the severe squall/storm foll owed by rainfall in the evening hours of 
30.05.2014. The report issued by the Indian Meteorological Department, 
New Delhi is Ex. PW -1/7.   
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 8 of 16 
 
32. Due to the storm,  damage was caused to all the plants i.e., P -01 to P -
07, except P -04 which were in operation, and the  Incident Report  Ex.               
PW-1/8 was immediately sent to the defendant/Company.  The Police and 
the Fire Department were also informed about the fire noticed in the 
Columns on 31.05.2014 Ex. PW -1/9. The Certificate issued by the Fire 
Department is Ex. PW -1/10.   
33. It is further not in dispute that M/s Cunningham & Lindsey 
International Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Limited was 
appointed by the defendant for conducting the survey and to assess the  
damage .  Mr. Anil Dhingra conducted the survey on 02.06.2014  and formed 
the opinion vide his Letter dated 20.10.2014 that 12,090.21 Kgs. of CIS -3 
Hexenol (cis -cut) in the distillation plants P -01 to P -03 and P -05 was “Work 
in Progress”  and was not covered under the Insurance Policy as the Cover 
Note provided coverage on “on stock of raw material, finished and semi 
finished goods, finished menthol oil, refer oil, spearmint oil and/or all other 
essential packing mat erial whilst stored and/or lying in the insured‟s 
factory” . 
34. It is further not in dispute that the plaintiff/Company had also taken an 
additional Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy from Universal Sompo 
General Insurance Company Limited in order to cove r its Building, Plant, 
machinery and stocks at the factory location for the period of 07.10.2013 to 
06.10.2014, Ex. PW -1/6.  The said policy had the cover loss for the Building 
upto Rs. 1,00,00,000/ - ;Plant and Machinery upto Rs. 4,00,00,000/ - and 
Stocks u pto Rs. 50,00,00,000/ -.  
35. The survey was conducted by PW3Bhagwati I. Subramaniam o n 
behalf of Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited o n the  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 9 of 16 
 
same date i.e., 02.06.2014 and had given his Final Survey Report dated 
14.03.2017, Ex. PW -1/5. He quantified the total loss of stock of CIS -3 
Hexenol Terpene cut in the distillation in the aforesaid Plants as 12,090 Kgs. 
and evaluated the value of the said stocks at Rs. 15,01,66,783/ -. He, after 
factoring 1/3rd proportionate share of Universal Sompo  General Insurance 
Company Limited, assessed its liability at Rs. 5,00,55,594/ - for the loss of 
stock.  
36. Admittedly,  the plaintiff/Company had filed its claim with the 
defendant/Insurance Company which was rejected by the defendant  its vide 
Letter dated 23. 12.2014, Ex. PW1/20,  essentially on the ground that the 
Insurance Cover was for the semi-finished goods , while the 
plaintiff /Company was claiming damages for the goods which were defined 
as „Work in Progress‟ (WIP ) as per the  Financial Statements  of the plaintiff . 
The Statement annexed to the Claim Form of the plaintiff Ex PW1/14 has 
been produced below:  
 
 
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 10 of 16

 Re: Claim No. 271400/11/2015/000040  
 Policy No. 271400/11/2015/521 D.O.L: 30.05.2014  
Dear Sir,  
 This has reference to your claim intimation dated 
31.05.2014 for the above claim. Accordingly, M/s Cunningham 
Lindsey International, Surveyors were deputed to carry out 
survey.  
 
 Now we are in receipt of their Final Report of M/s 
Cunningham Lindsey. In th eir report the Surveyors have given 
the following observations:  
 
 “The Policy provides coverage on “Raw Material, 
Finished and semi finished goods etc and /or all other essential 
packing material whilst stored and/or lying in the Insured‟s 
factory”.  
 
 The damaged material is neither Raw Material, 
Finished or Semi Finished Goods etc and/or all other 
essential packing material.It is „Work -in-Process‟, as it was 
material within the plant, undergoing processing/finishing 
etc. In the present case, it was heated material undergoing 
extraction of cis cut.  
 
 Since the loss/damage of stock undergoing process is not 
covered under the policy, hence the loss is found tenable and 
accordingly your claim file has been closed as „NO CLAIM‟.  
 
 The inconvenience caused to you  is deeply regretted.  
 
 Thanking you,  
 Yours faithfully,  
 
Authorized Signatory”  
  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 11 of 16 
 
38. The defendant has relied on the Final Survey Report  dated 
27.11.2014, Ex.PW1/19 of the Surveyor of Cunningham Lindsey 
International Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Limited 
appointed by the defendant.  The Final Survey Report has described  the 
process distillation  of the plaintiff/Company reads as under: - 
“The Insured procures Crude Mentha Oil (CMO), Crude 
Piperita  Oil and Neo Menthol fractions and uses the fractional 
distillation methodology to extract various fragrances present 
in the CMO.  The CMO after lab testing and caustic washing is 
sent to Fractional distillation columns.  
 
After first distillation three se parate tappings are made i.e.,  
 
 Menthol that has high boiling point is separated 
and crystallised and packed.  
 
 DMO that has medium boiling point is tapped and 
filtered, blended, packed and dispatched.  
 
 Cis cut i.e. Cis -3-Hexenol, having low boiling 
point is washed in boric solution and again sent for 
fractional distillation where it is separated in two 
components i.e. Terpene cut and Cis cut. The Cis cut is 
repeatedly sent to the fractional distillation to separate 
Terpene and finally purify the Cis cut until 98% purity.  
 
The affected item is work in process (WIP) of Cis cut of purity 
varying from 60% to 70% that was in fractional distillation, 
undergoing process for purification. The WIP either vaporised 
when column collapsed, or got washed away.”  
 
39. The aforesaid Survey Report further defines the nature and extent of 
damage/restoration as under : - 
“NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE/RESTORATION  
The distillation columns were operating with the CIS cut when 
the storm  hit the plant. Due to the collapse of the distillation 
columns from approximately the mid -way height, the joints, 
flanges etc had broken. The hot WIP started leaking and  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 12 of 16 
 
draining out of the columns. The thermic oil used for the 
heating the WIP also starte d leaking.  
The Insured have confirmed in their letter dated 21.08.2014 
that the valves on the inlet and outlet lines could not be closed 
as the hot oil at temperature at more than 100 deg centigrade 
and thermic fluid at temperature of about 200 deg centig rade 
was splashing and leaking. Thus the loss could not be mitigated.  
Following WIP is reportedly lost/leaked out and flowed out:  
 
Plant No  Status  Material  Loss (Kg)  
P-01 Damaged  Cis Cut  2278.6  
P-02 Damaged  Cis Cut  2283.2  
P-03 Damaged  Cis Cut  2351.8  
P-04 Damaged  Empty   
P-05 Damaged  Cis Cut  5526.6  
P-06 Saved  H/Cut   
P-07 Saved  Cis Cut   
Total    12440.2  
Less: Recovery (Water and oil Mix)  349.99  
Loss of qty claimed  12090.21  
 
40. The short question which falls for determination is whether the 
word „semi -finished goods‟  refers to „Work in Progress‟ as has been 
asserted by the plaintiff/Company and whether the two words are 
synonym ous to each  other .  
41. The aforesaid Survey Report  Ex. PW1/19 establishes that the 
plaintiff/Company was in the business of manufacturing menthol based 
chemicals/fragrances etc. This entails a process where the insured procures 
crude Mentha Oil (CMO), Crude Piperita Oil and Neo Menthol fractions and 
uses the fractional distillation methodology to extract various fragrances 
present in the CMO.  The process has been described to take place in three 
separate tappings i.e.,  
(i) Menthol that has high boiling point is separated and 
crystallised and packed;   
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 13 of 16 
 
(ii) DMO that  has medium boiling point is tapped and 
filtered, blended, packed and dispatched; and  
(iii) Cis cut i.e. Cis -3-Hexenol, having low boiling point is 
washed in boric solution and again sent for fractional 
distillation where it is separated in two components i.e. , 
Terpene cut and Cist cut. The Cis cut is repeatedly sent 
to the fractional distillation to separate Terpene and 
finally purify the Cis cut until 98% purity.  
42. From the aforesaid Survey Report itself , it is evident that Cis-3 
Hexanol  is the raw material which is processed through the distillation and 
the different components are extracted depending upon their respective 
boiling points.  After the extraction of the different components from the 
crude mentha oil, they are separately pac ked and dispatched.   
43. It is abundantly clear  from the Report that  Crude Mentha Oil (CMO) 
which is a raw product , undergoes various processes and is semi -finished till 
the final products are extracted, packed and dispatched.  It is the raw 
material  in form of oil and, it is a raw material which is in the process of 
being finished  till it reaches its final stage . Here, it is not any solid item 
which has different stages of completion into a final product. Here, it is a 
liquid which is being treated at differe nt levels to be moulded into the final 
product. Therefore, while the CMO  is in the distillation columns, it is the 
semi -finished product which is undergoing distillery  changes to result in a 
final product. It necessarily has to be held that CMO  at various stages in 
the distillation columns , is the product in semi -finished condition.   
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 14 of 16 
 
44. The plaintiff/Company has further explained that according to the In 
its Schedule III of the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 
formulated under Section 129 of the Companies Act, 2013  provides  the 
manner in which the inventories have to be presented in the Financial 
Statement by the Company.  It  provide s that the inventories shall be 
classified as:  
(a) Raw materials;  
(b) Work -in-Progress;  
(c) Finished goods;  
(d) Stock -in-trade (in respect of goods acquired for trading);  
(e) Stores and spares;  
(f) Loose tools;  
(g) Others (specify nature).  
45. The same format of accounting has been provided in Accounting 
Standard (AS) II, the objective of which reads as under:  
“A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the 
determination of the value at which inventories are 
carried in the financial statements until the related 
revenues are recognised. This Standard deals with the 
determination of such value, including the asc ertainment 
of cost of inventories and any write -down thereof to net 
realisable value.”  
 
46. It further provides that “ Inventories encompass goods purchased and 
held for resale, for example, merchandise purchased by a retailer and held 
for resale, computer software held for resale, or land and other property 
held for resale . Inventories also encompass finished goods produced, or 
work in progress being produced, by the enterprise and include materials,  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 15 of 16 
 
maintenance supplies, consumables and loose tools awaitin g use in the 
production process . Inventories do not include machinery spares which can 
be used only in connection with an item of fixed asset and whose use is 
expected to be irregular; such machinery spares are accounted for in 
accordance with Accounting S tandard (AS) 10, Accounting for Fixed 
Assets. ” 
47. It is evident that the goods were described in the language of 
accounting  as „Work in Progress‟ which are described as semi -finished in 
common parlance .  
48. From the process of manufacturing the final products fr om crude 
mentha oil, it is evident that the oil at various stages in the distillation 
columns is necessarily the semi-finished goods  which is in alternate word 
used to define the „ Work in Progress‟ . 
49. The defendant, therefore, was not justified in repudiating the claim of 
the plaintiff/Company solely on this ground of the description of the               
semi -finished goods as „Work in Progress‟. The damages, on account of 
material (raw, semi and final products), are well within the scope of 
Standar d Fire and Special Perils Insurance Policy.  
50. PW1/Dr. Kamal Kumar in his testimony has further deposed that the 
total damage that the plaintiff/Company has suffered  amounts to  Rs.

Sompo General Insurance Company Limited and, therefore, the liability of 
the defendant remains to the extent of Rs. 10,01,11,189.00/ -.

delineated in Schedule III formulated under Section 129 of the Companies 
Act, 2013 and AS II. This leads to the irresistible conclusion that the  
CS(COMM) 25/2018                                                                                                          Page 16 of 16 
 
phrase “semi -finished goods” referred to in the Policy related to 
inventories that are a “Work in Progress”. Therefore, the ground for 
rejection taken by the defendant insurer is nothing but a play of words 
and holds no merit.  
 
Relief: 
52. The plaintiff/Company is, therefore, held entitled to the recovery of  
amount Rs. 10,01,11,189.00/ -. The plaintiff/Company is also held entitled to 
interest @ 6 % w.e.f. 23.12.2014 (i.e. date rejection of the claim) till the date 
of realization.  
53. Accordingly, the present s uit is  decreed in the above terms.

HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA

     J    U    D    G    M    E    N    T
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
1. The present Suit for Recovery of Rs. 13,58,22,084/- has been filed on behalf of the plaintiff. 
2. Briefly stated, the plaintiff is a Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 having its registered Office at Sharp House, Plot No. 9, LSC, Gujranwala Town-I, Delhi-110009.
3. The plaintiff has a unit to manufacture aromatic chemicals and essential oils at C-15, SMA Co-operative Industrial Estate, New Delhi. The plaintiff/Company was initially known as Sharp Menthol India Limited. The name of the plaintiff Company was changed from 25.11.2011, to Sharp Global Ltd and w.e.f. 17.09.2014, but was subsequently again changed to Sharp Mint Ltd. The plaintiff/Company is a large producer of mint ingredients, including natural menthol and mind blends and has been accredited with ISO 9001: 2015 and ISO 22000 Certification and its products cater to various global industries. 
4. The case of the plaintiff is that it had obtained Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy from the defendant to cover its all stocks lying at its factory premises at C-15, SMA Co-operative Industrial Estate, Delhi upto Rs. 100 crores. It sought renewal of the said Policy to cover risk of its all stocks in whatever form lying in its factory premises. A Provisional Cover Note dated 07.05.2014 bearing No. 177305 was issued by the defendant to cover the risk under the Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy with additional covers for earthquake and Storm, Tempest, Flood, Inundation (STFI), from 08.05.2014 to 07.05.2015.  The schedule of the Policy was issued by the defendant on 31.07.2014. 
5. The plaintiff also obtained an additional Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy from Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited in order to cover its building, plant, machinery and stocks at the aforementioned location for the period of 07.10.2013 to 06.10.2014. The said Policy covered loss to the building upto Rs. 1,00,00,000/- ; plant and machinery upto Rs. 4,00,00,000/- and stocks upto Rs. 50,00,00,000/-.
6. It is stated that on 30.05.2014, Delhi and Districts of its neighbouring States Haryana and Uttar Pradesh i.e., Faridabad, Gurgaon, Noida and Greater Noida experienced a severe squall/storm followed by rainfall, in the evening hours of 30.05.2014 which uprooted many  trees, snapped off power lines and caused damage to many properties in and around Delhi. 
7. It is submitted that there were seven distillation plants (P-01 to  P-07) installed in the manufacturing unit of the plaintiff/Company.  All the plants i.e., P-01 to P-07, except P-04 were in operation on 30.05.2014. At about 05:00 PM, one of the Engineers noticed that the upper part of the Column of the plants i.e., P-01 to P-05, were leaning towards the Property bearing No. C-17, SMA Industrial Estate due to severe squall/storm and within the minutes, the Columns along with the structure started falling towards the building of another factory at C-17, SMA Industrial Estate. 
8. The Engineer also noticed a fire in the Columns and Vessels, and the Fire Department was intimated accordingly. The entire factory area was evacuated and as an additional precautionary measure, the staff and workers were shifted out of the factory premises. 
9. The plaintiff on the next day itself i.e. on 31.05.2014 informed both the Insurance Companies about the loss suffered by it due to the squall/storm on 30.05.2014. 
10. The defendant/Insurance Company appointed M/s Cunningham & Lindsey International Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Limited, who visited the site on 02.06.2014for inspection to make an assessment of the losses caused to the stock. 
11. The other Insurance Company i.e., Universal Sompo General Insurance Company appointed Mr. B.I. Subramaniam as Surveyors to conduct the survey and assess the loss.
12. The plaintiff/Company lodged a claim of Rs. 18,00,00,000/- with the defendant for the loss of 12,090.21 Kgs. of CIS-3 Hexenol, Terpene cut in the distillation plants i.e., P-01 to P-03 and P-05  due to squall/storm and fire. All the requisite documents, details and data were provided to the Surveyors.  
13. Mr. I.B. Subramanian, Surveyor appointed by the Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited, quantified the total loss of stock of CIS-3 Hexenol Terpene cut in the distillation in the aforesaid plants as 12,090 Kgs. and assessed the value of the  stocks at Rs. 15,01,66,783/-. After factoring 1/3rd proportionate share of Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited, assessed its liability at Rs. 5,00,55,594/- for the loss of stock. 
14. On the other hand, Mr. Anil Dhingra, Director of Cunningham Lindsey, while assessing the loss, wrongly formed an opinion that 12,090.21 Kgs. of CIS cut in the distillation plants P-01 to P-03 and P-05 was work in process (WIP) and was not covered under the Insurance Policy as the Cover Note provided the coverage on raw material, finished and                 semi-finished goods etc. and/or all other packing material whilst stored and/or lying in the insureds factory.
15. The plaintiff has submitted that it tried to explain to Mr. Anil Dhingra that all the stocks and packing material whilst stored or lying in its factory premises in whatever form, were covered under the Insurance Policy taken from the defendant/Company.
16. The plaintiff further explained that it was maintaining three types of inventory of stocks i.e., raw material, work in process (WIP) and finished goods. As per its Balance Sheet and in common parlance of the industry, semi-furnished goods are considered as WIP and the terms are used interchangeably. The plaintiff had been declaring WIP to the Banker for all stocks excluding raw material and finished goods. 
17. However, Mr. Anil Dhingra, Director of Cunningham Lindsey issued the Final Report dated 27.11.2014 by incorrectly observing that the loss of 12,090 Kgs. CIS-3 Hexenol Terpene of the affected premises was not covered under the Insurance Policy.  Mr. Dhingra, committed a grave error by failing to consider that   semi-finished goods are goods at intermediate stage between raw material and finished goods.  
18. The defendant, in a mechanical manner, without any justifiable reason repudiated the claim of the plaintiff vide Letter dated 23.12.2014 on the pretext that the damaged stocks were undergoing process and thus, were not covered under the Insurance Policy. The relevant portion of the Letter dated 23.12.2014 reads as under: -
Now we are in receipt of their Final Report of M/s Cunningham Lindsey. In their report the Surveyor have given the following observations:

The Policy provides coverage on ""Raw Material, Finished and semi finished goods etc and/or all other essential packing material stored and/or lying in the Insureds factory.

The damaged material is neither Raw Material, finished or Semi Finished Goods etc and/or all other essential packing material, it is Work-in-Process as it was material within the plant, undergoing processing/finishing etc. In the present case, it was heated material undergoing extraction of cis cut.

Since the loss/damage of stock undergoing process in not covered under the policy, hence the loss is not found tenable and accordingly your claim has been closed as NO CLAIM.
The inconvenience cause to you is deeply regretted.

19. The plaintiff vide its Letter dated 14.07.2016 and followed by many other representations, requested the defendant to re-examine and reassess its claim, but the defendant had failed to consider the requests of the plaintiff, constraining it to serve the Legal Notice dated 08.11.2017 upon the defendant making a claim for Rs. 13,47,03,033/-. However, despite service of the said Legal Notice, the amount has yet not been paid. 
20. Hence, the present Suit has been filed for recovery of Rs. 10,01,11,189/- as the loss suffered due to the damage caused to the stocks by the fire in the factory premises, in addition to Rs. 3,57,10,895/- towards the interest for the period 23.12.2014 till 12.12.2017 and pendente lite and future interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of the Suit till realisation.  
21. The defendant was served on 27.02.2018, but it failed to file the Written Statement and the right to file the same was closed on 10.10.2018.
22. The plaintiff examined PW1/Dr. Kamal Kumar, Vice-President of the plaintiff/Company to prove its assertion.  
23. PW2/Ved Kumar Jain, Charted Accountant, who is an expert, deposed that there is no difference between the work in progress or WIP and                semi-finished goods.  
24. PW3/Bhagwati I. Subramaniam, who was appointed as the Surveyor by Universal Sompo General Insurance Company had given his Report, Ex. PW1/5. 
25. PW1/Dr. Kamal Kumar and PW3/Bhagwati I. Subramanian were not cross-examined, while PW2/Ved Kumar Jain was cross-examined on behalf of the defendant. 
26. Learned counsel on behalf of the plaintiff has argued that                    semi-finished goods and Work in Progress are interchangeable terms as is also proved from the testimony of PW2/Ved Kumar Jain, Charted Accountant. Therefore, the claim of the plaintiff had been wrongly repudiated by the defendant and the said amount is liable to be paid to the plaintiff.  
27. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has placed reliance on the decisions in Texco Marketing Pvt. Ltd. vs. Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors. (2023) 15 SCC 428 and Schedule III, Division I, Financial Statements for a Company whose financial Statements are required to comply with the Companies (Accounting Standard) Rules, 2006.
28. Learned counsel on behalf of the defendant, however, has vehemently argued that in Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy Schedule, it has been clearly stated that risk cover was in support of the stocks of raw material, finished and semi-finished goods. As per the statements in documents of the plaintiff/Company itself, the goods were described asWork in Progress and did not qualify as semi-finished goods which alone along with raw material and finished material were insured under the Insurance Policy. The claim of the plaintiff/Company has been rightly repudiated and the present Suit is liable to be dismissed. 
29. Submissions heard and the record perused. 
30. It is an admitted fact that the plaintiff had taken the Standard Fire & Special Perils Insurance Policy from the defendant/Insurance Company for which a Provisional Cover Note dated 07.05.2014 bearing No. 117305Ex. PW-1/4 followed by Policy bearing No. 271400/11/2014/2019 covering risk from 08.05.2013 to 07.05.2014 Ex. PW-1/5 was issued. It was followed for the subsequent year by the Insurance Policy bearing No. 271400/400/11/2015/521 covering risk from 08.05.2014 to 07.05.2015.
31. It is also not denied that Delhi and the neighbouring States witnessed the severe squall/storm followed by rainfall in the evening hours of 30.05.2014. The report issued by the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi is Ex. PW-1/7. 
32. Due to the storm, damage was caused to all the plants i.e., P-01 to P-07, except P-04 which were in operation, and the Incident Report Ex.               PW-1/8 was immediately sent to the defendant/Company.  The Police and the Fire Department were also informed about the fire noticed in the Columns on 31.05.2014 Ex. PW-1/9. The Certificate issued by the Fire Department is Ex. PW-1/10.  
33. It is further not in dispute that M/s Cunningham & Lindsey International Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Limited was appointed by the defendant for conducting the survey and to assess the damage.  Mr. Anil Dhingra conducted the survey on 02.06.2014 and formed the opinion vide his Letter dated 20.10.2014 that 12,090.21 Kgs. of CIS-3 Hexenol (cis-cut) in the distillation plants P-01 to P-03 and P-05 was Work in Progress and was not covered under the Insurance Policy as the Cover Note provided coverage on on stock of raw material, finished and semi finished goods, finished menthol oil, refer oil, spearmint oil and/or all other essential packing material whilst stored and/or lying in the insureds factory.
34. It is further not in dispute that the plaintiff/Company had also taken an additional Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy from Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited in order to cover its Building, Plant, machinery and stocks at the factory location for the period of 07.10.2013 to 06.10.2014, Ex. PW-1/6.  The said policy had the cover loss for the Building upto Rs. 1,00,00,000/- ;Plant and Machinery upto Rs. 4,00,00,000/- and Stocks upto Rs. 50,00,00,000/-. 
35. The survey was conducted by PW3Bhagwati I. Subramaniam on behalf of Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited on the same date i.e., 02.06.2014 and had given his Final Survey Report dated 14.03.2017, Ex. PW-1/5. He quantified the total loss of stock of CIS-3 Hexenol Terpene cut in the distillation in the aforesaid Plants as 12,090 Kgs. and evaluated the value of the said stocks at Rs. 15,01,66,783/-. He, after factoring 1/3rd proportionate share of Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited, assessed its liability at Rs. 5,00,55,594/- for the loss of stock. 
36. Admittedly, the plaintiff/Company had filed its claim with the defendant/Insurance Company which was rejected by the defendant its vide Letter dated 23.12.2014, Ex. PW1/20, essentially on the ground that the Insurance Cover was for the semi-finished goods, while the plaintiff/Company was claiming damages for the goods which were defined as Work in Progress (WIP) as per the Financial Statements of the plaintiff. The Statement annexed to the Claim Form of the plaintiff Ex PW1/14 has been produced below:

37. The aforesaid Letter dated 23.12.2014, Ex. PW1/20 rejecting the Claim of the plaintiff reads as under: -
M/s Sharp Global Ltd.
C-15, SMA, CO-OP INDL. Estate,
DELHI-110033.
	Re: Claim No. 271400/11/2015/000040
	Policy No. 271400/11/2015/521 D.O.L: 30.05.2014
Dear Sir, 
	This has reference to your claim intimation dated 31.05.2014 for the above claim. Accordingly, M/s Cunningham Lindsey International, Surveyors were deputed to carry out survey. 

	Now we are in receipt of their Final Report of M/s Cunningham Lindsey. In their report the Surveyors have given the following observations:

	The Policy provides coverage on Raw Material, Finished and semi finished goods etc and /or all other essential packing material whilst stored and/or lying in the Insureds factory.

	The damaged material is neither Raw Material, Finished or Semi Finished Goods etc and/or all other essential packing material.It is Work-in-Process, as it was material within the plant, undergoing processing/finishing etc. In the present case, it was heated material undergoing extraction of cis cut.

	Since the loss/damage of stock undergoing process is not covered under the policy, hence the loss is found tenable and accordingly your claim file has been closed as NO CLAIM.

	The inconvenience caused to you is deeply regretted. 

	Thanking you, 
	Yours faithfully, 

     Authorized Signatory
        
38. The defendant has relied on the Final Survey Report dated 27.11.2014, Ex.PW1/19 of the Surveyor of Cunningham Lindsey International Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Limited appointed by the defendant. The Final Survey Report has described the process distillation of the plaintiff/Company reads as under: -
The Insured procures Crude Mentha Oil (CMO), Crude Piperita Oil and Neo Menthol fractions and uses the fractional distillation methodology to extract various fragrances present in the CMO.  The CMO after lab testing and caustic washing is sent to Fractional distillation columns. 

After first distillation three separate tappings are made i.e.,

> Menthol that has high boiling point is separated and crystallised and packed.

> DMO that has medium boiling point is tapped and filtered, blended, packed and dispatched.

> Cis cut i.e. Cis-3-Hexenol, having low boiling point is washed in boric solution and again sent for fractional distillation where it is separated in two components i.e. Terpene cut and Cis cut. The Cis cut is repeatedly sent to the fractional distillation to separate Terpene and finally purify the Cis cut until 98% purity.

The affected item is work in process (WIP) of Cis cut of purity varying from 60% to 70% that was in fractional distillation, undergoing process for purification. The WIP either vaporised when column collapsed, or got washed away.

39. The aforesaid Survey Report further defines the nature and extent of damage/restoration as under : -
NATURE AND EXTENT OF DAMAGE/RESTORATION
The distillation columns were operating with the CIS cut when the storm hit the plant. Due to the collapse of the distillation columns from approximately the mid-way height, the joints, flanges etc had broken. The hot WIP started leaking and draining out of the columns. The thermic oil used for the heating the WIP also started leaking. 
The Insured have confirmed in their letter dated 21.08.2014 that the valves on the inlet and outlet lines could not be closed as the hot oil at temperature at more than 100 deg centigrade and thermic fluid at temperature of about 200 deg centigrade was splashing and leaking. Thus the loss could not be mitigated. 
Following WIP is reportedly lost/leaked out and flowed out:

40. The short question which falls for determination is whether the word semi-finished goods  refers to Work in Progress as has been asserted by the plaintiff/Company and whether the two words are synonymous to each other. 
41. The aforesaid Survey Report Ex. PW1/19 establishes that the plaintiff/Company was in the business of manufacturing menthol based chemicals/fragrances etc. This entails a process where the insured procures crude Mentha Oil (CMO), Crude Piperita Oil and Neo Menthol fractions and uses the fractional distillation methodology to extract various fragrances present in the CMO. The process has been described to take place in three separate tappings i.e., 
(i) Menthol that has high boiling point is separated and crystallised and packed; 
(ii) DMO that has medium boiling point is tapped and filtered, blended, packed and dispatched; and 
(iii) Cis cut i.e. Cis-3-Hexenol, having low boiling point is washed in boric solution and again sent for fractional distillation where it is separated in two components i.e., Terpene cut and Cist cut. The Cis cut is repeatedly sent to the fractional distillation to separate Terpene and finally purify the Cis cut until 98% purity.
42. From the aforesaid Survey Report itself, it is evident that Cis-3 Hexanol is the raw material which is processed through the distillation and the different components are extracted depending upon their respective boiling points.  After the extraction of the different components from the crude mentha oil, they are separately packed and dispatched.  
43. It is abundantly clear from the Report that Crude Mentha Oil (CMO) which is a raw product, undergoes various processes and is semi-finished till the final products are extracted, packed and dispatched.  It is the raw material in form of oil and, it is a raw material which is in the process of being finished till it reaches its final stage. Here, it is not any solid item which has different stages of completion into a final product. Here, it is a liquid which is being treated at different levels to be moulded into the final product. Therefore, while the CMO is in the distillation columns, it is the semi-finished product which is undergoing distillery changes to result in a final product. It necessarily has to be held that CMO at various stages in the distillation columns, is the product in semi-finished condition. 
44. The plaintiff/Company has further explained that according to the In its Schedule III of the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 formulated under Section 129 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides the manner in which the inventories have to be presented in the Financial Statement by the Company.  It  provides that the inventories shall be classified as: 
(a) Raw materials;
(b) Work-in-Progress;
(c) Finished goods;
(d) Stock-in-trade (in respect of goods acquired for trading);
(e) Stores and spares;
(f) Loose tools;
(g) Others (specify nature).
45. The same format of accounting has been provided in Accounting Standard (AS) II, the objective of which reads as under:
A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the determination of the value at which inventories are carried in the financial statements until the related revenues are recognised. This Standard deals with the determination of such value, including the ascertainment of cost of inventories and any write-down thereof to net realisable value.

46. It further provides that Inventories encompass goods purchased and held for resale, for example, merchandise purchased by a retailer and held for resale, computer software held for resale, or land and other property held for resale. Inventories also encompass finished goods produced, or work in progress being produced, by the enterprise and include materials, maintenance supplies, consumables and loose tools awaiting use in the production process. Inventories do not include machinery spares which can be used only in connection with an item of fixed asset and whose use is expected to be irregular; such machinery spares are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standard (AS) 10, Accounting for Fixed Assets.
47. It is evident that the goods were described in the language of accounting as Work in Progress which are described as semi-finished in common parlance. 
48. From the process of manufacturing the final products from crude mentha oil, it is evident that the oil at various stages in the distillation columns is necessarily the semi-finished goods which is in alternate word used to define the Work in Progress.
49. The defendant, therefore, was not justified in repudiating the claim of the plaintiff/Company solely on this ground of the description of the               semi-finished goods as Work in Progress. The damages, on account of material (raw, semi and final products), are well within the scope of Standard Fire and Special Perils Insurance Policy. 
50. PW1/Dr. Kamal Kumar in his testimony has further deposed that the total damage that the plaintiff/Company has suffered  amounts to  Rs. 15,01,66,783/-.However, the part liability had been paid by the Universal Sompo General Insurance Company Limited and, therefore, the liability of the defendant remains to the extent of Rs. 10,01,11,189.00/-. 
51. In conclusion, it is clear that Inventories can only be categorised as delineated in Schedule III formulated under Section 129 of the Companies Act, 2013 and AS II. This leads to the irresistible conclusion that the phrase semi-finished goods referred to in the Policy related to inventories that are a Work in Progress. Therefore, the ground for rejection taken by the defendant insurer is nothing but a play of words and holds no merit.

Relief:
52. The plaintiff/Company is, therefore, held entitled to the recovery of amount Rs. 10,01,11,189.00/-. The plaintiff/Company is also held entitled to interest @ 6 % w.e.f. 23.12.2014 (i.e. date rejection of the claim) till the date of realization. 
53. Accordingly, the present suit is decreed in the above terms. 
54. The Decree Sheet be prepared accordingly. 
55. The pending application, if any, also stands disposed of.

1908 (hereinafter referred to  as “CPC”) has been filed on behalf of the 
applicant /defendant No. 1 -cum-Counter Claimant  seeking modification of 
the Preliminary Decree dated 18.10.2019.  
2. It is submitted in the application  that consequent to the demise of 
Shri Ravi Chand Garg, the father  of the parties, on 12.08.2016, the present 
Suit for Partition was filed inter se  the legal heirs of Late Shri Ravi Chand  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 2 of 11 
 Garg and other co -owners.  The parties arrived at a Settlement dated 
10.10.2019 in the Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Cent re and 
on the basis of said Settlement, a Preliminary Decree and a final Decree 
were made on 18.10.2019.    
3. Now, in the year 2023, the present application has been filed wherein 
it is submitted that Smt. Kaushalya Garg, the original defendant No. 2 has 
died on 23.04.2021 and Shri Sushil Garg, defendan t No. 5 has died on 
04.05.2021.  Both the deceased left their properties which has devolved upon 
their legal heirs. On account of the demise of the two defendant s, the parties 
are facing difficulty in execution o f the Final Decree and the Sale of the 
properties as there are concerns being raised by the prospective buyers about 
the entitlement of the legal heirs of the two deceased defendants  to the suit 
properties which is creating an impediment in realising the a ctual value of 
the suit properties.  
4. It is further submitted that since the final Decree is yet to be engrossed 
on non -judicial stamp paper, the Preliminary  and Final  Decree may be re -
drawn with the legal heirs of Smt. Kaushalya Garg, the original defenda nt 
No. 2 and Shri Sushil Garg, defendant No. 5 being substituted in the original 
Preliminary Decree itself .   
5. The learned counsel on behalf of the defendant No. 1 /judgment 
debtor No. 1/counter -claimant, has placed reliance upon Syed Mohiddin & 
Ors. vs. Abd ul Rahim & Ors ., AIR 1964 AP 260 ; Surjdeo Dubey & Ors. vs. 
Kripa narayan Tiwary , AIR 1969 PAT 284 ; S. Narayana Reddy & Ors. vs. 
S. Sai Reddy, 1990 SCC OnLine AP 12 ; Dharmaraja Vellalar vs. 
Ramachandra Vellalar & Ors ., MANU/TN/0397/1992 ; wherein, it was 
observed that the Final Decree becomes executable only on being engrossed  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 3 of 11 
 on the requisite stamp paper.  
6. Submissions heard.   
7. The controversy  in hand  is whether the legal heirs of the parties to a 
Final Decree can be permitted to seek a ch ange  in the Final Decree on 
account  of demise of some of the parties leading to change in the shares as 
defined in the Preliminary decree; especially when  Final Decree is yet to be  
engrossed on the requisite stamp paper.  
8. In Yeswant Deorao Deshmukh vs. Walchand Ramchand Kothar i, 1950 
SCC 766 , it was held that the payment of court fee i.e. on the amount found 
due was entirely in the power of the decree -holder and there was nothing to 
prevent him from paying it then and there ; a decree is capable of execution 
from the very date i t was passed.  
9. In the case of Hameed Joharan vs. Abdul Salam , AIR 2001 SC 3404 , 
while considering the bar under Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, it was 
held that the prescribed period shall not be allowed to remain suspended, 
until the stamp paper is fur nished and the partition decree is drawn thereon 
and subsequently signed by the Judge. The Apex Court differentiated 
between ‘executability’  and ‘enforceability’  of the decree. The word 
„execution‟  was held to mean the process for enforcing or giving effec t to the 
Judgment of the Court and it is completed when the decree holder gets the 
money or the relief awarded to him, by the Judgment. Though the decree 
may not be received in evidence or be acted upon / enforced  in execution due 
to the non -payment or defi cient payment of stamp duty on the decree, but 
the period of limitation cannot be said to remain under suspension at the 
volition and mercy of the litigant. The period of limitation starts from the 
date of Final Decree  and cannot be stopped from running at  the instance of  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 4 of 11 
 an individual unless the same has a statutory sanction  of being conditional.  
10. The Apex Court in the case of Chiranji  Lal through LRs  vs. Hari Dass  
through LRs , (2005) 10 SCC 746 , considered this very aspect. It was 
explained that a decree in a suit for P artition declare s a right of the part ies in 
an immovable property and divides  the share s by metes and bounds . Such a 
decree in a suit for partition is considered as an instrument liable for the 
payment of stamp duty under the Stamp Act. The object of the Stamp Act  is 
to secure the rev enue  for the State and the Scheme of the Act provides that a 
decree of partition not duly stamped can be impoun ded and once, the 
requisite stamp duty along with the penalty, if any, is paid, the decree can be 
acted upon.  
11. It was further observed in Chiranji  Lal (supra) that t he engrossment of 
the Final Decree in a suit for P artition , would rel ate back to the date of 
decree. The date of furnishing of stamp paper  is dependent and within the 
domain purview and contro l of the party. The Code of Civil Procedure , 1908  
or the Limitation Act , does not provide a period or a timeframe for 
furnishing of stamp paper. Pertinently, on the engrossment of a Final Decree 
in a suit for partition, it relates back to the date of the d ecree. Therefore, a 
party by its own act of not furnishing the stamp paper , cannot stop the 
running of the period of limitation. The limitation for execution of a decree 
within a period of 12 years , commences as soon as a Final Decree  is made 
and cannot be  suspended  due to the violation of either party in failing to 
provide the requisite stamp paper. Nor can the period of limitation be 
suspended , till the stamp paper is furnished and the decree is engrossed there 
upon.  
12. A reference was made to earlier Judgm ents of Shankar Balwant  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 5 of 11 
 Lokhande (Dead) by Lrs. vs. Chandrakant Shankar Lokhande , (1995) 3 SCC 
413 and  West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation vs. 
Swadesh Agro Farming and Storage Pvt. Ltd.  & Ors.,  (1999) 8 SCC 315 , to 
observe  that even if the re is a direction by the Court for furnishing of the 
stamp paper by a particular date for the purposes of engrossing of a decree, 
the period of lim itation commences from the date  when the Decree is passed 
and not from the date when the Decree is engrossed on the stamp papers 
supplied by the parties. The legislative mandate as sanctioned under Article 
136 of the Limitation Act, cannot be kept in abeyance unless the said 
legislation makes a provision thereof.  
13. In Chiranji Lal (supra ), it was further observed  that, the Indian Stamp 
Act, 1899  is a fiscal measure  enacted with  an object to secure revenue  for 
the State on certain classe s of instrument s. It is not enacted to arm a litiga nt 
with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent.  
14. Section 2(15 ) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 defines „instrument of 
partition‟ as an y instrument whereby co -owners of any property divide or 
agree  to divide such property in s everality , and includes also a final order for 
effecting a partition passed by any Civil Court /Arbitrator , directing partition. 
Article 45 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1989 , prescribes the proper 
stamp duty payable in case of an instrument of partition.  Section 33 of the 
Indian Stamp Act , 1989, provides for the impoundin g of the instrumen t not 
duly stamped and for ex amination of the instrument for ascertaining whether 
the instrument is proper ly stamped . Section 3 5 provides that no instrument 
chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any 
person having by law or c onsent of parties, authority to receive evidence or 
shall be acted upon , registered or authenticated unless such instrument  is  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 6 of 11 
 duly stamped. Section 40 (b) provides for impounding of an instrument not 
duly stamped.  
15. In Arjun Somdutt  vs. Vi van Somdutt , EFA (O S) No. 1/19, decided by 
the Division Bench of this Court on 17.11.2022, it was held that  the issue of 
stamp duty cannot be a stumbling  block to the enforcement of a decree by 
directing creation of the first charge on the sale proceeds for the payment of 
stamp duty. In this manner the interest of the State , shall be secured and the 
apportionment  of the sale proceeds amongst the decree holder and transfer of 
rights would only be done thereafter.  
16. The Co -ordinate Bench of this Court in Suma n Sapra  vs. Rosy Dabas 
and Others  (2023 SCC Online Delhi 1843 ), referred to the afore -discussed  
judgments and observed that the decree becomes executable , on the date of 
passing of the judgment and not from the date, it is engrossed on the 
requisite stamp paper.  
17. In a suit for  partition, the shares of the parties to the suit are declared 
by the Court, by passing of a preliminary decree and the allotment of 
specific portion of the property to different owners, is finally worked out by 
way of a final decree. Thus, if demise of an y of the legal heirs takes place 
after the passing of preliminary decree, but before the Final Decree, the 
Court is still in s eision????  of the matter and may pass a second Preliminary 
Decree on the basis of the change brought about by the death. This, 
however, cannot go on interminably and the power of the Court to effect 
alteration in the shares of the parties on the basis of death would 
terminate with the passing of a  Final Decree. Thereafter, the Court has no 
power to modify the decree and the Executing  Court is obligated to execute 
the decree as it stood on the day of final judgment.   
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 7 of 11 
 18. A decree in a suit of partition, declares the rights of the parties in the 
immovable properties and divides the shares by metes and bounds. Since the 
decree creates rights and liabilities of the parties in immovable properties, it 
is considered as an instrument liable for payment of stamp duty under the 
Indian Stamp Act and if it is submitted for execution, it has to be necessarily 
impounded. Only, on payment of requisite co urt fee and a stamp duty along 
with the penalty, it can be executed/acted upon.  
19. The Apex Court in Phool chand & Anr. vs. Gopal La l, AIR 1967 SC 
1470 , recognizing the pecu liar nature of a partition suit , observed that if an 
event trans pires  after the passing  of Preliminary Decree and necessitates a  
change in shares , the Court can and should  do so and if there is a d ispute  in 
that behalf, the Order of the Court deciding that dispute and making 
variation  in shares specified  in the Preliminary Decree already pas sed, would 
be a decree in itself which is liable to appeal. It was clarified that such 
change can be done only so long as the Final Decree has not been p assed . 
Therefore, the changes brought due to demise of any of the parties, which 
brings about alteratio n in the shares can be considered till the passing of 
Final Decree, after which this power ceases.   
20. The Executing Court  cannot go behind the Final Decree. The 
Executing Court would not be competent to either refuse or execute a decree 
or modify the shares  of the respective parties , by reason of death occurring 
subsequent to the passing of Final Decree.  
21. In the case of Gostha  Behari Ghosh  vs Anil Kumar Sa rkar & Ors. , 
1980 SC C Online Cal 21 , while considering this aspect, it was held that it 
would not be com petent for the executing Court to either refuse to execute a 
decree or to modify the same on the ground of alteration in the shares of the  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 8 of 11 
 respective patties by reason of death occurring subsequent to the pas sing of 
the decree .  
22. In the Case of Shivaramaiah  v. Mallikarjunaiah,  1977 SCC OnLine  
Kar 215 it was held that if shares get altered as a result of the death of any of 
the parties after the completion of the process o f partition by the Civil Court 
which made the decree under Order 20 Rule 18 of the C PC, the same court  
cannot be approached  for the purpose of adjustment of the shares of the 
parties in the very same proceedings . In such a case, the parties may have to 
seek relief in a separate suit, as has also been held in the Case of Phool chand 
& Anr. vs. Gopal Lal (supra)  and Parsu ram Raja ram Tewari vs. H ira Bat 
Raja ram T ewari, AIR 1957 Bom 59 . 
23. Coming to the facts of the present case, the Final Decree was 
admittedly passed on 18.10.2019, which means an executable Final Decree 
was made on the 18.10. 2019 . Merely because it is yet to be engrossed on the 
requisite no n-judicial stamp paper , it cannot be  claimed that there is 
anything further to be done by the Court. Essentially, it is a ministerial  act to 
be done on providing of the requisite stamp paper by the parties and nothing 
further survives before the Court . Non engrossing of the Final Decree does 
not make it inexecutable but shall be unenforceable till it is engrossed on the 
requisite stamp paper. In the light of the law , as discussed above, it has to be 
necessarily held that after the passing of Final Decree, the Court cannot take 
cognizance of subsequent events or alteration of shares , on account of death 
of some of the parties.  
24. In this regard, it would be pertinent to refer to Order XXII  Rule 6 
CPC, which reads as under: - 
  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 9 of 11 
 “Order XXII - 
 
6. No abatement by reason of death after hearing. —
Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing 
rules, whether the cause of action survives or not, there 
shall be no abatement by reason of the death of either 
party  between the conclusion of the hearing and the 
pronouncing of the judgment, but judgment may in such 
case be pronounced notwithstanding the death and shall 
have the same force and effect as if it had been 
pronounced before the death took place. ” 
 
25. From this  provision, it can be inferred that the legal heirs of a party 
may not be impleaded once the final arguments are concluded and 
irrespective of the death  of a party,  the final Judgment would  still be 
pronounced  in the name of the deceased  party. This implie s that the hearing 
of a case stands concluded once the final arguments are addressed and 
nothing more survives to be done by either party except that the Court on the 
basis of the pleadings  and the Judgment , has to make the final adjudication. 
Therefore, t he Rule itself  provide s that no suit shall abate  on demise of 
either party once the final hearing has been concluded. The Code of Civil 
Procedure , 1908 itself contemplates situations  where the demise of either 
party would not make it necessary to imple ad the legal heirs of a deceased 
party even though the Judgment is yet to be pronounced. In the cases where 
Final Decree has been passed there is nothing more to be done  even by the 
Court and therefore, the contention of the defendant/applicant that the 
procee dings do not stand concluded till the Final Decree is engrossed on the 
requisite stamp paper is fallacious  and not sustainable.  
26. It is also pertinent to refer to Order 41 Rule 1 CPC . The provision  
originally provided that an Appeal can be preferred only aga inst a “decree”,  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 10 of 11 
 however, the word “decree” stands substituted by word “Judgment ” vide 
amendment dated Civil Procedure (Amendment ) Act, 1999 Act 46 of 199 9 
w.e.f. 01.07. 2002. This amendment further re inforces  the conclusion that a 
drawing of a decree is no t essential  for the purpose of filing an Appeal as 
the last paragraph  of Judgment is to be cons trued  as the D ecree , implying a 
finality to the judgement once pronounced . Therefore, non-engrossing of the 
Final Decree  on the requisite stamp paper , is no  longer a pre-requisite for 
preferring the Appeal.  By the same logic, once the judgement has become 
final, drawing of decree is no longer a prerequisite for its executability  
though it shall not be enforceable till it is engrossed  on the requisite stamp 
paper.  
27. In light of the above discussion , the judgements relied upon by the 
learned counsel on behalf of the defendant No. 1/judgment debtor No. 
1/counter -claimant [ Surjdeo Dubey & Ors. (supra) ; S. Narayana Reddy & 
Ors. (supra) ; Dharmaraja Vellalar (supra) ; wherei n it was observed that the 
Final Decree becomes executable only on being engrossed on the requisite 
stamp paper , are of only persuasive value and not applicable in view of the 
express dictum of the Apex Court in the judgements discussed above . 
28. Now advertin g to the assertions  in the present case,  the defendant No. 
1, Smt. Kaush alya Garg  has died on 23.04.2021, i.e. subsequent to the Final 
Decree and has left a Will dated  20.09.2016, where by she has bequeathed  
her share in favour of the defendant No. 1. The validity of the Will would 
have to be necessarily established  by way of a separate Suit and may require 
not only impleadment of her other legal Heirs but also fresh adjudication in 
regard to he r share on the basis of subsequent events and Will . It is a fres h 
cause of action which cannot be transposed  to the events  which have  
CS(OS) 448/2016   Page 11 of 11 
 happened in the past and have be en concreti zed by way of a Final Decree.  
To interpret it otherwise would lead to an absurdity of there being no finality 
in Partition Suits where the shar es would keep devolving on the demise of 
parties, after the passing of Final Decree.  
29.  Likewise, f or the reasons  discussed above , the subsequent demise of 
defendant No. 5 cannot allow the  reopening the Final Decree dated 
18.10.2019 , which has already attain ed finality.  
30. The application of the defendants, is, therefore, not tenable in law and 
is here by dismissed.

I.A. 10007/2023 (u/S 151 of CPC, 1908 by D-1-cum-Counter Claimant for directions)

1. The Application under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as CPC) has been filed on behalf of the applicant/defendant No. 1-cum-Counter Claimant seeking modification of the Preliminary Decree dated 18.10.2019. 
2. It is submitted in the application that consequent to the demise of Shri Ravi Chand Garg, the father of the parties, on 12.08.2016, the present Suit for Partition was filed inter se the legal heirs of Late Shri Ravi Chand Garg and other co-owners. The parties arrived at a Settlement dated 10.10.2019 in the Delhi High Court Mediation and Conciliation Centre and on the basis of said Settlement, a Preliminary Decree and a final Decree were made on 18.10.2019.  
3. Now, in the year 2023, the present application has been filed wherein it is submitted that Smt. Kaushalya Garg, the original defendant No. 2 has died on 23.04.2021 and Shri Sushil Garg, defendant No. 5 has died on 04.05.2021. Both the deceased left their properties which has devolved upon their legal heirs. On account of the demise of the two defendants, the parties are facing difficulty in execution of the Final Decree and the Sale of the properties as there are concerns being raised by the prospective buyers about the entitlement of the legal heirs of the two deceased defendants to the suit properties which is creating an impediment in realising the actual value of the suit properties. 
4. It is further submitted that since the final Decree is yet to be engrossed on non-judicial stamp paper, the Preliminary and Final  Decree may be re-drawn with the legal heirs of Smt. Kaushalya Garg, the original defendant No. 2 and Shri Sushil Garg, defendant No. 5 being substituted in the original Preliminary Decree itself.  
5. The learned counsel on behalf of the defendant No. 1/judgment debtor No. 1/counter-claimant, has placed reliance upon Syed Mohiddin & Ors. vs. Abdul Rahim & Ors., AIR 1964 AP 260; Surjdeo Dubey & Ors. vs. Kripa narayan Tiwary, AIR 1969 PAT 284; S. Narayana Reddy & Ors. vs. S. Sai Reddy, 1990 SCC OnLine AP 12; Dharmaraja Vellalar vs. Ramachandra Vellalar & Ors., MANU/TN/0397/1992; wherein, it was observed that the Final Decree becomes executable only on being engrossed on the requisite stamp paper.
6. Submissions heard.  
7. The controversy in hand is whether the legal heirs of the parties to a Final Decree can be permitted to seek a change in the Final Decree on account of demise of some of the parties leading to change in the shares as defined in the Preliminary decree; especially when Final Decree is yet to be engrossed on the requisite stamp paper. 
8. In Yeswant Deorao Deshmukh vs. Walchand Ramchand Kothari, 1950 SCC 766, it was held that the payment of court fee i.e. on the amount found due was entirely in the power of the decree-holder and there was nothing to prevent him from paying it then and there; a decree is capable of execution from the very date it was passed.
9. In the case of Hameed Joharan vs. Abdul Salam, AIR 2001 SC 3404, while considering the bar under Section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act, it was held that the prescribed period shall not be allowed to remain suspended, until the stamp paper is furnished and the partition decree is drawn thereon and subsequently signed by the Judge. The Apex Court differentiated between executability and enforceability of the decree. The word execution was held to mean the process for enforcing or giving effect to the Judgment of the Court and it is completed when the decree holder gets the money or the relief awarded to him, by the Judgment. Though the decree may not be received in evidence or be acted upon/ enforced in execution due to the non-payment or deficient payment of stamp duty on the decree, but the period of limitation cannot be said to remain under suspension at the volition and mercy of the litigant. The period of limitation starts from the date of Final Decree and cannot be stopped from running at the instance of an individual unless the same has a statutory sanction of being conditional. 
10. The Apex Court in the case of Chiranji Lal through LRs vs. Hari Dass through LRs, (2005) 10 SCC 746, considered this very aspect. It was explained that a decree in a suit for Partition declares a right of the parties in an immovable property and divides the shares by metes and bounds. Such a decree in a suit for partition is considered as an instrument liable for the payment of stamp duty under the Stamp Act. The object of the Stamp Act is to secure the revenue for the State and the Scheme of the Act provides that a decree of partition not duly stamped can be impounded and once, the requisite stamp duty along with the penalty, if any, is paid, the decree can be acted upon. 
11. It was further observed in Chiranji Lal (supra) that the engrossment of the Final Decree in a suit for Partition, would relate back to the date of decree. The date of furnishing of stamp paper is dependent and within the domain purview and control of the party. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or the Limitation Act, does not provide a period or a timeframe for furnishing of stamp paper. Pertinently, on the engrossment of a Final Decree in a suit for partition, it relates back to the date of the decree. Therefore, a party by its own act of not furnishing the stamp paper, cannot stop the running of the period of limitation. The limitation for execution of a decree within a period of 12 years, commences as soon as a Final Decree is made and cannot be suspended due to the violation of either party in failing to provide the requisite stamp paper. Nor can the period of limitation be suspended, till the stamp paper is furnished and the decree is engrossed there upon. 
12. A reference was made to earlier Judgments of Shankar Balwant Lokhande (Dead) by Lrs. vs. Chandrakant Shankar Lokhande, (1995) 3 SCC 413 and West Bengal Essential Commodities Supply Corporation vs. Swadesh Agro Farming and Storage Pvt. Ltd. & Ors., (1999) 8 SCC 315, to observe that even if there is a direction by the Court for furnishing of the stamp paper by a particular date for the purposes of engrossing of a decree, the period of limitation commences from the date when the Decree is passed and not from the date when the Decree is engrossed on the stamp papers supplied by the parties. The legislative mandate as sanctioned under Article 136 of the Limitation Act, cannot be kept in abeyance unless the said legislation makes a provision thereof. 
13. In Chiranji Lal (supra), it was further observed that, the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is a fiscal measure enacted with an object to secure revenue for the State on certain classes of instruments. It is not enacted to arm a litigant with a weapon of technicality to meet the case of his opponent. 
14.

Article 45 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1989, prescribes the proper stamp duty payable in case of an instrument of partition. Section 33 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1989, provides for the impounding of the instrument not duly stamped and for examination of the instrument for ascertaining whether the instrument is properly stamped. Section 35 provides that no instrument chargeable with duty shall be admitted in evidence for any purpose by any person having by law or consent of parties, authority to receive evidence or shall be acted upon, registered or authenticated unless such instrument is duly stamped. Section 40(b) provides for impounding of an instrument not duly stamped.
15. In Arjun Somdutt vs. Vivan Somdutt, EFA (OS) No. 1/19, decided by the Division Bench of this Court on 17.11.2022, it was held that the issue of stamp duty cannot be a stumbling block to the enforcement of a decree by directing creation of the first charge on the sale proceeds for the payment of stamp duty. In this manner the interest of the State, shall be secured and the apportionment of the sale proceeds amongst the decree holder and transfer of rights would only be done thereafter. 
16. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Suman Sapra vs. Rosy Dabas and Others (2023 SCC Online Delhi 1843), referred to the afore-discussed judgments and observed that the decree becomes executable, on the date of passing of the judgment and not from the date, it is engrossed on the requisite stamp paper.
17. In a suit for partition, the shares of the parties to the suit are declared by the Court, by passing of a preliminary decree and the allotment of specific portion of the property to different owners, is finally worked out by way of a final decree. Thus, if demise of any of the legal heirs takes place after the passing of preliminary decree, but before the Final Decree, the Court is still in seision???? of the matter and may pass a second Preliminary Decree on the basis of the change brought about by the death. This, however, cannot go on interminably and the power of the Court to effect alteration in the shares of the parties on the basis of death would terminate with the passing of a Final Decree. Thereafter, the Court has no power to modify the decree and the Executing Court is obligated to execute the decree as it stood on the day of final judgment.
18. A decree in a suit of partition, declares the rights of the parties in the immovable properties and divides the shares by metes and bounds. Since the decree creates rights and liabilities of the parties in immovable properties, it is considered as an instrument liable for payment of stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act and if it is submitted for execution, it has to be necessarily impounded. Only, on payment of requisite court fee and a stamp duty along with the penalty, it can be executed/acted upon.
19. The Apex Court in Phoolchand & Anr. vs. Gopal Lal, AIR 1967 SC 1470, recognizing the peculiar nature of a partition suit, observed that if an event transpires after the passing of Preliminary Decree and necessitates a change in shares, the Court can and should do so and if there is a dispute in that behalf, the Order of the Court deciding that dispute and making variation in shares specified in the Preliminary Decree already passed, would be a decree in itself which is liable to appeal. It was clarified that such change can be done only so long as the Final Decree has not been passed. Therefore, the changes brought due to demise of any of the parties, which brings about alteration in the shares can be considered till the passing of Final Decree, after which this power ceases. 
20. The Executing Court  cannot go behind the Final Decree. The Executing Court would not be competent to either refuse or execute a decree or modify the shares of the respective parties, by reason of death occurring subsequent to the passing of Final Decree. 
21. In the case of Gostha Behari Ghosh vs Anil Kumar Sarkar & Ors., 1980 SCC Online Cal 21, while considering this aspect, it was held that it would not be competent for the executing Court to either refuse to execute a decree or to modify the same on the ground of alteration in the shares of the respective patties by reason of death occurring subsequent to the passing of the decree. 
22. In the Case of Shivaramaiah v. Mallikarjunaiah, 1977 SCC OnLine Kar 215 it was held that if shares get altered as a result of the death of any of the parties after the completion of the process of partition by the Civil Court which made the decree under Order 20 Rule 18 of the CPC, the same court cannot be approached for the purpose of adjustment of the shares of the parties in the very same proceedings. In such a case, the parties may have to seek relief in a separate suit, as has also been held in the Case of Phoolchand & Anr. vs. Gopal Lal (supra) and Parsuram Rajaram Tewari vs. Hira Bat Rajaram Tewari, AIR 1957 Bom 59.
23. Coming to the facts of the present case, the Final Decree was admittedly passed on 18.10.2019, which means an executable Final Decree was made on the 18.10.2019. Merely because it is yet to be engrossed on the requisite non-judicial stamp paper, it cannot be claimed that there is anything further to be done by the Court. Essentially, it is a ministerial act to be done on providing of the requisite stamp paper by the parties and nothing further survives before the Court. Non engrossing of the Final Decree does not make it inexecutable but shall be unenforceable till it is engrossed on the requisite stamp paper. In the light of the law, as discussed above, it has to be necessarily held that after the passing of Final Decree, the Court cannot take cognizance of subsequent events or alteration of shares, on account of death of some of the parties. 
24. In this regard, it would be pertinent to refer to Order XXII Rule 6 CPC, which reads as under:-

Order XXII-

6. No abatement by reason of death after hearing.Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing rules, whether the cause of action survives or not, there shall be no abatement by reason of the death of either party between the conclusion of the hearing and the pronouncing of the judgment, but judgment may in such case be pronounced notwithstanding the death and shall have the same force and effect as if it had been pronounced before the death took place.

25. From this provision, it can be inferred that the legal heirs of a party may not be impleaded once the final arguments are concluded and irrespective of the death of a party, the final Judgment would still be pronounced in the name of the deceased party. This implies that the hearing of a case stands concluded once the final arguments are addressed and nothing more survives to be done by either party except that the Court on the basis of the pleadings and the Judgment, has to make the final adjudication. Therefore, the Rule itself provides that no suit shall abate on demise of either party once the final hearing has been concluded. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 itself contemplates situations where the demise of either party would not make it necessary to implead the legal heirs of a deceased party even though the Judgment is yet to be pronounced. In the cases where Final Decree has been passed there is nothing more to be done even by the Court and therefore, the contention of the defendant/applicant that the proceedings do not stand concluded till the Final Decree is engrossed on the requisite stamp paper is fallacious and not sustainable.
26. It is also pertinent to refer to Order 41 Rule 1 CPC. The provision originally provided that an Appeal can be preferred only against a decree, however, the word decree stands substituted by word Judgment vide amendment dated Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1999 Act 46 of 1999 w.e.f. 01.07.2002. This amendment further reinforces the conclusion that a drawing of a decree is not essential  for the purpose of filing an Appeal as the last paragraph of Judgment is to be construed as the Decree, implying a finality to the judgement once pronounced. Therefore, non-engrossing of the Final Decree on the requisite stamp paper, is no longer a pre-requisite for preferring the Appeal. By the same logic, once the judgement has become final, drawing of decree is no longer a prerequisite for its executability though it shall not be enforceable till it is engrossed on the requisite stamp paper.
27. In light of the above discussion, the judgements relied upon by the learned counsel on behalf of the defendant No. 1/judgment debtor No. 1/counter-claimant [Surjdeo Dubey & Ors.(supra); S. Narayana Reddy & Ors. (supra); Dharmaraja Vellalar (supra); wherein it was observed that the Final Decree becomes executable only on being engrossed on the requisite stamp paper, are of only persuasive value and not applicable in view of the express dictum of the Apex Court in the judgements discussed above.
28. Now adverting to the assertions in the present case, the defendant No. 1, Smt. Kaushalya Garg has died on 23.04.2021, i.e. subsequent to the Final Decree and has left a Will dated 20.09.2016, whereby she has bequeathed her share in favour of the defendant No. 1. The validity of the Will would have to be necessarily established by way of a separate Suit and may require not only impleadment of her other legal Heirs but also fresh adjudication in regard to her share on the basis of subsequent events and Will. It is a fresh cause of action which cannot be transposed to the events which have happened in the past and have been concretized by way of a Final Decree. To interpret it otherwise would lead to an absurdity of there being no finality in Partition Suits where the shares would keep devolving on the demise of parties, after the passing of Final Decree.
29.  Likewise, for the reasons discussed above, the subsequent demise of defendant No. 5 cannot allow the reopening the Final Decree dated 18.10.2019, which has already attained finality. 
30. The application of the defendants, is, therefore, not tenable in law and is hereby dismissed.

1. The plaintiffs have claimed  Recovery of Damages in the sum of Rs. 15 
Crores  for intentional illegal detention, malicious prosecution and Tort of 
abuse of process of Court.  
2. The plaintiff No.1 Arun Gupta  is a B.Com (Hons), LLB, ICWA and 
MBA , having secured second position in B.Com (Hons) from Shri Ram  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 3 of 33 
 College of Commerce, University of Delhi, Gold Medalist in ICWA and 
secured second position in MBA from Faculty of Management Studies, 
Delhi.  He is a prominent share broker since 1990 and is an active member of 
different Trade Associations, Professional Bodies, Sports Associat ions, 
Social & Cultural Organizations, Residents Bodies, Hospital Trust and 
Alumni Association.  Plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 are brothers . 
3. The plight of the plaintiffs started when they received a Notice dated 
18.12.2003 from EOW requiring their appearance on 22. 12.2003 upon a 
complaint dated 24.12.2003 made against them by Shri N.S. Hoon  
(defendant no.4) . The EOW conducted its inquiry for about nine months 
during which the plaintiffs fully cooperated and appeared as and when 
required  and produced the documents as  required by EOW.  Eventually, 
without their knowledge an FIR No.221/2004 dated  25.08.2004 under 
Sections 406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC  was registered against 
them .  Pursuant thereto, they were arrested on 03.11.2004 , just a few days 
before Diwali , without any basis  or evidence . The Investigating Authority 
should have collected the documentary eviden ce to substantiate the  bald 
allegations made in the complaint that funds had been remitted  by way of 
cheques and shares , as loan by the complainant  to th e plaintiffs, before 
registering the FIR and arresting the plaintiffs  as it is the duty of the State 
Machinery to first collect evidence to substantiate the allegations mentioned 
in the complaint .  
4. It is further alleged that the  Charge  Sheet dated  27.12.2004 wrongly 
stated that the Report from Accounting Expert was awaited even though it 
had already been received in EOW , on 25.12.2004. The Accounting Expert 
Report dated 23.12.2004 , found no fraud in the accounts maintained for the  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 4 of 33 
 transactions carri ed out b y the complainant , but it  was intentionally and 
deliberately suppressed . No reason has been stated by the Investigating 
Agency for such delay  of three years in filing the Accounting Expert Re port 
before the Court . Further, the EOW received the GEQD/FSL Rep ort dated 
31.01.2005 , which confirmed that all the documents in question bore the 
original signatures of the complainant  and suggested that there was no 
forgery committed , but was only partially filed in the Court o n 05.02.2005.   
Thus, the two reports  prove that the plaintiffs were innocent and arrested 
without any basis .  
5. It is asserted that  the purpose of investigation is to collect the 
evidence and to find out the truthfulness of the allegations , as emphasized by 
the Supreme Court in various judgements.  The allegations of cheating and 
forgery should have been verified before arresting the plaintiffs ; in fact , it 
was only on 24.11.2004 , i.e.  after the arrest of the plaintiffs , that the 
documents relating to business relationships between the plaintiffs and  
complaint was sent to FSL and an Accountant for verification and audit , 
respectively.  Thus, the actions of the Investigation Authority  by firstly,  not 
collecting the requisite evidence prior to the arrest and secondly , deliberate ly 
withholding and suppres sing the available evidence , makes  the prosecution  
malicious.  
6. The plaintiffs filed Crl. M.C. 2183/2005 & Crl. M.C.2184/2005 for 
quashing of the FIR before this Court  on 20.05.2005 , but were dismissed on 
25.04.2007 by a neutral Order and the matter was refe rred back to the Trial 
Court.   
7. An application dated 07.07.2007 was filed by the plaintiffs before the 
framing of charge , for further investigations  on various points under Section  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 5 of 33 
 173 (8) of Cr.P.C. The I.O . appeared before the Learned Magistrate on 
04.08 .2007 and informed that further investigations are being undertaken 
which went on for about three years after which a Cancellation Report / 
Final Report  dated 25.06.2010 under Section 173 (8) of Cr.P.C , was filed by 
EOW .  
8. It is claimed that there were inher ent contradictions in the allegations  
as in the Charge Sheet, while on one hand it was  stated that the Delivery 
Instruction Slips were forged ; on the other hand , it stated that the shares 
were given on Loan.  There was malicious arrest of the plaintiffs an d no 
explanation has been given as to  why no Cancellation Report instead of 
Charge Sheet w as filed in the first instance.  Hence, the plaintiffs have 
claimed that the State machinery is guilty of taking away the right of the 
plaintiffs to live with dignity and integrity by arresting them without proper 
verification of the allegations , which continued for seven years before the 
Cancellation Report was finally submitted . 
9. The complainant filed a Protest Petition on 22.1.2010 which was 
dismissed by the Trial Cou rt vide Order dated 03.03.2011.  The Cancellation 
Report was accepted and the plaintiffs were discharged. A Revision Petition 
No.444/2011 was filed by the complainant on 26.08.2011 before this Court 
along with an application for Condonation of Delay.  The m atter on 
30.11.2011 was referred by this Court to SEBI. The plaintiffs appeared 
before SEBI on 26.04.2012 and explained the facts.  SEBI gave its affidavit 
on 22.01.2013 and the Revision Petition was dismissed by this Court on 
26.09.2013. This Order to the  knowledge of the plaintiffs , has not been 
challenged by the complainant.  
    
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 6 of 33 
 10. The plaintiffs have further asserted that the arrest of the plaintiffs was 
widely reported in newspapers and T.V which not only led to huge financial 
losses as they had to sell at a throw away price, their shares in property at 
Mausam Vihar, Delhi , but it also created problem in the marriage of their 
children.  R estrictions were put on the Companies of the plaintiff to trade 
w.e.f . 04.11.2004 by National Stock Exchange which were l ifted only on 
01.07.2005 after the Disciplinary Action Committee of the Stock Exchange 
gave a personal hearing to the plaintiffs on 30.06.2005 , at Mumbai. The 
plaintiffs ’ goodwill touched rock bottom and the debtors of the plaintiffs 
delayed the payments w hile the creditors knocked at their doors to take their 
money.  The Post Office Department has still not renewed their Agency and 
J& K Bank had not renewed plaintiff’s DP Operations.  Many clients have 
left them. The plaintiffs had to give formal represent ations to Broker 
Associations and even to their own Resident’s Welfare Association in 
August, 2005, after their release from jail to prove their innocence . 
11. The plaintiffs then filed a Writ Petition  bearing  No.7465/2014 on 
25.09.2014 to claim damages in the  sum of Rs.100 crores.   An objection 
was taken by learned counsel for Delhi State and Delhi Police  on 03.11.2014 
that Writ was not an appropriate remedy  and the plaintiff should claim 
damages by way of a suit. This Court in its Order dated 11.02.2016 obser ved 
that disputed question of facts were involved,  and the Writ petition was 
withdrawn by the plaintiff with the liberty to file a Civil Suit. 
12. Hence, the plaintiffs have claimed  Rs.15 Crores along with interest @ 
9% per annum from the date of their arrest till payment as damages for 
physical, mental, financial losses and for lowering of image, status, 
reputation in Society and also for their wrongful acts and detention in jail.   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 7 of 33 
 13. The defendant No. 2 in its  Written Statement (which was  adopted 
by defendant No.1  Vide order dated 25.04.2017) explained that the 
complainant , Shri N.S. Hoon,  had filed a complaint dated 24.11.2003 
against the plaintiffs , alleging  that the plaintiffs had  cheated him of Rs.3 .50 
crores and for misappropriation  of funds , in EOW .  
14. It is stated that t he Investigating Agency diligently enquired into the 
facts and circumstances surrounding  the complaint for about nine months 
and eventually registered the FIR No.221/2004  dated 25.08.2004 under 
Section 406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC.   During the course of the 
investigation, the plaintiff was arrested as it was required at that point of 
time and the  factum of arrest  was duly informed to the family members of 
the plaintiffs. It is asserted that there was sufficient ground/evidence to 
arrest the plaintiffs  and it is denied that the arrest was made mala fide.  It is 
claimed that the investigations were done diligently,  and the arrest was made 
after nine months of the complaint having been received in the office , and 
that too  after rigorous enqui ry.   
15. It was further submitted that it is a well -settled principle that in a case 
of malicious prosecution, there must be no reasonable or probable cause for 
the prosecution. In the present matter, there was reasonable cause for the 
defendants to proceed w ith the prosecution  as there was prima facie 
evidence to suggest that transactions between the complainant and plaintiffs 
had taken place.  
16. As per procedure, i n compliance of Section 57/167 of Cr.P.C , the 
plaintiff was produced before the learned Judicial M agistrate and the entire 
case was put before him , along with the application  for the plaintiffs’  
remand  in police custody . On being satisfied , police custody of the plaintiffs  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 8 of 33 
 was granted on 03.11.2004 for two days . There after, the plaintiffs were 
again pr oduced before the learned Judicial Magistrate and based on the 
grounds of the arrest, the plaintiffs were  sent to Judicial Custody.  
17. It is asserted by the defendant that from the date of the arrest on 
03.11.2004 till the  Charge Sheet was filed on 29.12.200 4, the judicial 
remand for custody was granted by the learned Court time and again and at 
no point of time did the Court observe that the plaintiffs were arrested 
without any ground.  Further, the plaintiffs filed bail application s four times, 
but they were  all dismissed by observing that the allegation against the 
plaintiffs were very grave. It is pointed out that t he bail under Section 439 
Cr.P. C. was also dismissed by the learned ASJ  as a huge  amount was 
involved  in the case .  
18.  The defendant ha s explained  that when new facts came to light and to 
the knowledge of EOW, the matter was further investigated and brought to 
the notice of the Court and on finding that the allegations against the 
plaintiffs were not substantiated, the Final Report/ Cancellation Rep ort was  
accordingly  submitted.   
19. It is explained that the Report of the Accounting Expert was received 
in the office of EOW on 25.12.2004 and was handed over to the I.O on 
27.12.2004 . It is because  certain clarifications were required in the Report 
from co ncerned Accounting Expert/ C.A., that the Report could not be filed 
on 29.12.2004 along with the Charge Sheet . The defendant a sserted that the 
FSL/GEQD and Audit Report  dated 31.01.2005 were only received  by the 
EOW on 1.02.2005 and it is explained that the report was filed partially as 
certain clarifications in the Report  were needed from the  concerned 
laboratory .    
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 9 of 33 
 20. Further investigations were directed to be conducted on the points 
raised by the plaintiffs and a detailed investigation was carried out and 
eventually a Cancellation Report was filed under Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C 
on 08.07.2010.  
21. It is denied that there was any malice in the acts of the answering 
defendants.  It is also denied that the plaintiffs are entitled to any damages 
on account of loss o f reputation or for mental/ physical trauma on account of 
acts of the defendants.  
22. The plaintiffs in their Replication to the  Written Statement 
denied the assertions made by the defendant Nos. 1 and 2.  
23.  Defendant No. 3 failed to file the Written Statement  within the  
Statutory period and was proceeded ex -parte  vide Order dated 29.08.2016.  
24. During the course of the proceedings , the suit has been rejected 
vide Order dated 03.12.2018 against  defendant No.4 , the complainant Shri 
N.S. Hoon , as being barred by limi tation .  
25. Upon the rejection of the suit against the complainant, the question 
that arose was  whether the Suit was maintainable against defendant Nos. 1 
to 3, as the cognizance was taken  on the Charge Sheet by the Court  and had 
eventually accepted the Cance llation Report . 
26. Arguments were addressed  on behalf of the parties on the 
maintainability of the suit . 
27. The plaintiffs filed a Written Synopsis on the issue of maintainability 
of the suit wherein it was asserted that a suit can be dismissed or rejected at 
the initial stage only  under Order 7 rule 11 CPC  and there is no application 
in this regard by the defendants . It was asserted that the present suit involves  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 10 of 33 
 intricate questions of law and facts which can be adjudicated only after the 
complete trial .  
28. It was  further asserted that Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC has limited 
application  and it must  be shown  from the averments made in the Plaint  that 
the Suit is barred under any law , to attract  its application . Reliance was 
placed on the case of C. Natranjan v. Ashim  Bai & Anr  2008 AIR (SC) 363 ; 
Bhau Ram vs Janak Singh  2012 AIR (SC) 3023 ; Mayar H.K Ltd vs Owners 
& Parties Vessel M.V.Fortune Express  AIR 2006 SC 1828 ; Ramesh B Desai 
vs Bipin Vadilal Mehta  AIR 2006 SC 3672 ; Balasria Construction (p) Ltd vs 
Hanuman Seva  Trust & other 2006 (5) SCC 658 ; and Popat And Kotecha 
Property vs State Bank of  India Staff Association  2005 (7) SCC 510 .  
29. The Plaintiff asserted that the proceedings were instituted by the 
defendant  without any reasonable and probable cause in the instant matter, 
and the Complainant did not provide any relevant documents to substantiate  
his complaint . Further , the Investigating Agency also did not try to find out 
the truth  and it was  only after the application under Section 173(8) CrPC 
was filed by the plai ntiffs that the Investigating Agency came out with the 
truth that no relevant  documents have been filed by the Complainant to 
substantiate the  claims.  
30. The plaintiff  conten ded that as i) there was no probable cause for 
instituting the  prosecution;  and ii) the prosecution or  suit terminated 
favorably to the defendant , the suit for malicious  prosecution was 
maintainable. Reliance was placed  on the case of West Bengal State 
Electricity v. Dilip Kumar Ray  AIR 2007 SC 976 ; S. Nambi Narayan vs. 
Siby Mathews (2018)  10 SCC 804  in this regard.   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 11 of 33 
 31. It was asserted that no arrest can be made merely because it is lawful 
for the police officer to do so , as the arrest and detention in police lock -up of 
a person can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self -esteem  of a 
person.  Reliance was placed on the case of D.K. Basu v. State of West 
Bengal  (1997) 1 SCC  416; S. Nambi Narayan  (Supra); Joginder Kumar v. 
State of U.P. and Ors.  (1994) 4 SCC  260; Pankaj Kumar Sharma v . GNTCD 
& Ors  in W.P. (C) 3851 of  2023 dated 05.10.202 3; Nilabati Behera alias 
Lalita Bahera v State of Orissa 1993 (2) SCC 746 ; Harshendra Kumar D. v 
Rebatilata Koley etc. (2011) 3 SCC 351 ; Kiran Bedi v. Committee of Inquiry 
and Anr  (1989) 25  SCC  494; Vishwanath Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath 
Agrawal  (2012) 7 SCC 288; Bhim Singh MLA v State  AIR 1986 SC 494 ; 
Prempal & Others v. CP and Others  2010  ILR Delhi 416 ; Saheli v. C.P. 
Delhi Police AIR 1990 SC  513; State  of Rajasthan v . Mst. Vidyawati  and 
another , 1962  AIR  SC 933 ; Bhola Kum har v. State of C hhattisgarh , 2022

1036; and Delhi Judicial Service Association v. State of Gujarat and Ors  
19913 SCR 936  to highlight the impa ct of malicious prosecution , malicious  
arrest, illegal arrest and malicious i nvestigation . 
32. It was argued that anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest 
or detention  ha s an enforceable right to compensation  as for the infraction 
of the right to life , the only practical form of redressal is by awarding 
monetary damages.  It was ass erted that  where the infringement of right is 
established , the Court  cannot stop by giving a mere declaration  and it must 
give compensatory relief  as has been observed in the case of Rudul Sah vs 
State of Bihar , (1983) 4 SCC 141 and Kasturi Lal Ralia  Ram Jain vs The 
State of U.P , AIR 1965 SC 1039 .  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 12 of 33 
 33. It was further a rgued  that the investigation s should be judicious, fair, 
transparent and expeditious to  ensure compliance with the basic rule of law.  
Reliance was placed on the case of  Mithilesh  Kumar  Singh v. State of 
Rajasthan  2015 9 SCC 795; Nirmal  Singh Kahlon  v. State of Punjab  and 
Others  (2009) 1 SCC 441; and Sidhartha  Vashistha  alias  Manu Sharma  v. 
State ( NCT of Delhi) (2010) 6 SCC 1. 
34. The learned counsel for defendant Nos. 1 to 3  relied on the dicta of  
Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh  (2014) 2 
SCC 1 , to contend that it is mandatory for the State machinery to register an 
FIR immediately on receiving a complaint of commission of an offence and, 
therefore,  the acts of answering  defendants were in accordance with Law. 
The suit does not disclose any cause of action against the answering 
defendants and must be dismissed as not maintainable.   
35. Submissions heard . 
The claim of the plaintiffs for damages rests on their averments that t hey 
were maliciously prosecuted by the defendants.  
 
Understanding  Malicious Prosecution : 
36. The plaintiffs have sought damages stating that they were subjected to  
malicious  prosecution and the proceedings against them have led to 
lowering of their reputation  and esteem in public eye.  
37. At this point it is pertinent to understand  the law on Malicious 
Prosecution.  Bouvier defined a malicious act as  'a wrongful act, 
intentionally done, without cause or excuse‟.   
38. The Salmond on Torts, 11th edu., p. 742,  defined the  lack of 
reasonable or probable cause  as follows -  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 13 of 33 
 “Reasonable and probable cause means a genuine belief, 
based on reasonable grounds, that the proceedings are 
justified.”  
39. American Jurisprudence, pp. 731 -732 (S. 47), defines probable cause 
as follows: — 
“Ma ny definitions of the term „probable cause‟ as used in 
actions for malicious prosecution, differing more or less 
in their language, are to be found in the decisions . Thus, 
for instance, probable cause for a criminal prosecution 
has been defined as a reason able ground for suspicion, 
supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in 
themselves to warrant a cautious, or as some Courts put 
it, a prudent man in the belief that the party is guilty of 
the offence with which he is charged as the existence of 
such f acts and circumstances as would excite belief in a 
reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the 
knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged 
was guilty of the offence for which he was prosecuted, 
and as such facts and circumstances as, when 
comm unicated to the generality of men of ordinary and 
impartial minds, are sufficient to raise in them a belief 
or real, grave suspicion of the guilt of the person . With 
reference to civil actions, probable cause has been said to 
be such reason supported by fa cts and circumstances as 
will warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action 
and the means taken in prosecuting it are legally just and 
proper. „Probable cause‟ in this connection, does not 
mean sufficient‟ cause; and the question in the action is 
not whether there was in fact a sufficient cause for the 
prosecution or proceeding complained of, since the 
acquittal or failure of the proceeding shows that there 
was not. A definition sufficiently exact to meet 
satisfactorily every possible test would be d ifficult, if not 
impossible, to furnish for the complete legal idea 
expressed by the term „probable cause‟ is not to be 
gathered from a mere definition. However, 
notwithstanding the different wordings of the many  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 14 of 33 
 judicial definitions before referred to, th ere seems to be 
sufficient substantial agreement among them to warrant 
the statement that the standard of conduct for beginning 
or continuing any proceeding, whether civil or criminal, 
is that of a reasonable or ordinarily prudent man placed 
in the same si tuation as the defendant. That is, if a 
reasonable man would have believed and acted under 
the circumstances as the defendant did, there would be 
probable cause; otherwise not.  It is to be noted that the 
conduct of the defendant is to be weighed in view of  what 
appeared to him at the time of instituting the prior 
proceeding, not in the light of subsequently appearing‟ 
facts.”  
 
40. The term 'malice,'  as used in the expression 'malicious prosecution' is 
not to be considered in the sense of spite or hatred against  an individual, but 
of malus animus , and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and 
indirect motives.  
41. The principles to be borne in mind in the case of actions for malicious 
prosecutions  is that Malice is not merely the doing of a wrongful act 
intentionally but it must be established that the defendant was actuated by 
malus animus , that is to say, by spite or ill will or any indirect or improper 
motive.  But if the defendant had reasonable or probable cause of launching 
the criminal prosecution n o amount of malice will make him liable for 
damages. Reasonable and probable cause must be such as would operate on 
the mind of a discreet and reasonable man; 'malice' and 'want of reasonable 
and probable cause,' have reference to the state of the defendan t's mind at 
the date of the initiation of criminal proceedings and the onus rests on the 
plaintiff to prove them.   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 15 of 33 
 42. In the case of the State of Bihar through District Magistrate, 
Bhagalpur v. Rameshwar Prasad Badiya & anr . 1980 SCC OnLine Pat 38, 
Apex Court explained that Malice and absence of reasonable and probable 
cause must unite in order to produce liability. Malice  in common acceptation 
means ill -will against a person, but in its legal sense it means a wrongful 
act, done intentionally, without just caus e or excuse . Malice signifies the 
presence of some improper and wrongful motive —that is to say, an intent 
to use the legal process in question for some other than its legally appointed 
and appropriate purpose. Reasonable and probable  cause means a genuine 
belief, based on reasonable grounds, that the proceedings are justified.  
43. The Apex Court in the case of West Bengal State Electricity Board vs. 
Dilip Kumar Ray  (2007) 14 SCC 568 discussed various facets of malice.  It 
observed that there may be malice in fa ct or malice in law .  Malice in fact   
relates to actual state or condition of mind of the person who did the act, 
while Malice in law simply means a depraved inclination on the part of a 
person to disregard the rights of others, which intent is manifested by his 
injurious acts.  
44. The Apex Court in West Bengal State Electricity Board (supra) 
further drew a distinction between malicious abuse of legal  process  and 
malicious abuse of process .  It was observed that w hile the former consisted 
of malicious misuse or  misapplication of process to accomplish a purpose 
not warranted or commanded by the order of the Court like malicious 
perversion of a regularly issued process, whereby an improper result is 
secured ,  the malicious abuse of process  means wilfully misapplyi ng court 
process to obtain object not intended by law.  For instance, initiation of 
vexatious civil proceedings known to be groundless is not abuse of process,  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 16 of 33 
 but is governed by substantially the same rules as the malicious prosecution 
of criminal proceed ings.  It was further iterated that t he term 'malicious 
prosecution'  imports a causeless as well as an ill -intended prosecution on 
some charge of crime which is willful , wanton, reckless, or against the 
prosecutor's sense of duty and right, or for ends he k nows or is bound to 
know are wrong and against the dictates of  public policy.  
45. In malicious prosecution there are two essential elements, namely, 
that no probable cause existed  for instituting the prosecution or suit 
complained of, and that such prosecutio n or suit terminated in some way 
favorably to the defendant therein.  
46. The Apex Court Rameshwar Prasad Badiya & anr . (supra) observed 
that the defendant in an action for malicious prosecution is not required to 
believe that the accused is guilty; it is enoug h if he believes there is 
reasonable and probable cause for a prosecution. He need only be satisfied 
that there is a proper case to lay before the court. It may not always be 
possible to have direct evidence of these two requirements of a suit for 
maliciou s prosecution but the connected relevant circumstances may 
sometimes furnish a clue to the same.  It propounded the following four 
conditions to succeed in a suit for malicious prosecution:  
“(1) that the proceedings must have been instituted or 
continued by  the defendant; (2) that he must have acted 
without reasonable and probable cause; (3) that he must 
have acted maliciously; and (4) that the proceedings must 
have been unsuccessful that is to say, must have 
terminated in favour of the plaintiff.”  
  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 17 of 33 
 47. Similar conditions for malicious prosecution, had been  laid down by 
the Privy Cou ncil in the case of Mohammad Amin v. Jogendra Kumar,  AIR 
1947 PC 108 . 
48. In the light of above propositions, the facts of this case may be 
examined to ascertain whether the plaintiffs h ave been able to show that, (i) 
act of defendants is „a wrongful act‟ done  „intentionally‟ ;  and (ii) it  was 
done „without a reasonable or probable cause‟.  
Was the registration of Complaint and consequent Investigations/arrest of 
the plaintiffs by the De fendants,  wrongful:  
49. The plaintiff has alleged that he was arrested without any evidence 
and th us, he has sought damages and compensation on account of his alleged 
illegal arrest for six months from 03.11.2004  to 26.04.2005 .  
50. It is also asserted by him that  evidence , such as Reports exonerating 
him were deliberately suppressed by the Investigating Agency and that  the 
entire  prosecution  was malicious in nature .  
51. It is not in dispute that a complaint was made by the complainant Shri 
N.S. Hoon dated 24.12.2003  against the plaintiffs wherein it was alleged that  
he was a non -resident Indian  and Chairman of  Turner Morrison  & Graham 
Group  of Company . He had been approached by M/s OJ Financial Services 
Ltd, owned by plaintiff no.1 and 2 which is purported ly a Renow ned 
Security &  Financial  Company of  Delhi Operation  in April 2002, through a 
share broker, Sunil Singhania. He had been told that the plaintiffs  would  
pay interest @ Rs. 1.5 % per month on cash deposit  as well as on the deposit 
of Public quoted acceptable  Shares calculated on current  quoted pri ces. He 
was incentivized to invest money with the plaintiffs. However, they stopped  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 18 of 33 
 paying him interest from November onwards and alleged that the 
complainant had been defrauded and cheated him to the tune of Rs. 3.5  cr.  
52. The question before this Court for consideration is wh ether the 
defendant Nos. 1 to 3  did not collecting the requisite evidence prior to the 
arrest ; and  whether they  deliberately withh eld and suppress ed the available 
evidence  while filing the Charge  Sheet in the Court .  
Non collecti on of  the requisite evidence prior to the arrest : 
53. The EOW conducted an initial inquiry  on this complaint, for about 
nine months  after which the FIR No.  221/2004  under Section 
406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC  was regist ered on 25.08.2004, 
against the plaintiffs. Thereafter, the plaintiffs were arrested on 03.11.2004 
i.e. after about two months of registration of FIR.  Pertinently, the 
Investigating Officer sought Police Remand for interrogation and 
investigations which w as allowed for two days  and thereafter, the plaintiffs 
were sent to judicial custody by the Court.  It is also not in dispute that the 
Bail applications of the plaintiffs were rejected four times by learned 
Metropolitan Magistrate and Additional Sessions J udge and they were 
eventually granted bail after six months of their arrest , by this Court on 
26.04.2005.  
54. Chapter 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  deals with the 
information to the Police and their powers to investigate. It lays out the 
procedure to be  followed during investigations to set the criminal law in 
motion and  provide s for all procedural safeguards so as to ensure that the 
investigation is fair and is not malafide and that there is no tampering with 
the evidence collected during the investiga tions.  
55.  Section 154 Cr.P.C . reads  as under: -  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 19 of 33 
 “Section 154.  Information in cognizable cases.  
(1) Every information relating to the commission of a 
cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in 
charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing 
by him or under his direction, and be read over to the 
informant; and every such information, whether given 
in writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be 
signed by the person giving it, and the substance 
thereof shall be entered in a book to be ke pt by such 
officer in such form as the State Government may 
prescribe in this behalf:  
Provided ….. 
(2)…. 
(3)….” 
 
56. The contours of Section 154 have been questioned many a times . The 
legislative intent behind Section 154 as is elaborated in the case of State o f 
Haryana v. Bhajan Lal  1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 as under:  
“49. Consequently, the condition that is sine qua non for 
recording an FIR under Section 154 of the Code is that 
there must be information and that information must 
disclose a cognizable offence. If any information disclosing 
a cognizable offence is led before an officer in charge of 
the police station satisfying the requirement of Section 
154(1), the said police officer has no other option except to 
enter the substance thereof in the prescribed form, that is 
to say, to register a case on the basis of such information . 
The provision of Section 154 of the Code is mandatory  and 
the concerned officer is duty bound to register the case on 
the basis of information disclosing a cognizable offence. 
Thus, the p lain words of Section 154(1) of the Code have to 
be given their literal meaning. ” 
  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 20 of 33 
 57. The Apex Court in the case of Bhajan Lal  (supra), emphasized that at 
the stage of registration of a crime on the basis of the information disclosing 
a cognizable offence und er Section 154(1) of the CrPC, the police officer 
concerned cannot embark upon any enquiry as to whether the information 
laid by the complainant is reliable or credible. In fact, the Office In charge 
of Police Station is statutorily obliged to register a c ase and then to proceed 
with the investigation, if he has reason to suspect the commission of an 
offence, which he is empowered by virtue of Section 156, subject to the 
proviso of Section 157.  
58. It was further explained in Bhajan Lal  (supra), that under 154( 1) of 
the CrPC, the legislature in its collective wisdom, has carefully and 
cautiously used the expression "" information "" without qualifying it as 
“reasonable complaint ” and “ credible information ” as used in Section 
41(1)(a) or (g) of the Code. Evidently, n on-qualification of the word 
“information ” under Section 154 (1) was for the reason that Police Officer 
should not refuse to record an information relating to commission of a 
cognizable offence or to register the FIR thereon, on the ground that he is 
not s atisfied with the reasonableness or credibility of the information. In 
other words, 'reasonableness and credibility'  is not a condition precedent for 
registration of FIR. Therefore, it is has to necessarily follow that if the 
complaint discloses a cognizab le offence, the Police Officer has no 
discretion and the use of word ""shall""  in Section 154(1) implies that it is a 
mandatory duty on the police officer to register the FIR. The only condition 
sine quo non for registration of FIR thus, is a complaint discl osing 
commission of a cognizable offence. This aspect has been reiterated and 
reaffirmed in the case of Khub Chand vs. State of Rajasthan , AIR 1967 SC  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 21 of 33 
 1074, Prakash Singh Badal vs. State of Punjab,  (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193, 
Ramesh Kumari vs. State  (NCT of De lhi), (2006) 1 SCC (Cri.) 678.  
59. Reference may also made to the case of CBI vs. Tapan Kumar Singh , 
2003 SCC (Cri) 1305, wherein it was observed that FIR is not an 
encyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details relating to the 
offence reported. If the information revealed a cognizable offence is prima 
facie made out, the FIR has to be necessarily registered.  Once an FIR is 
registered, the police machinery gets activated to conduct the investigations 
under Section 156 Cr.P.C. The question as to wheth er the complaint is true 
whether it discloses the manner of occurrence whether the accused is named 
and whether there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations are all 
matters which are alien to the consideration of the question whether the 
report discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. If these details are 
not available and are not given in the complaint, the investigating officer is 
obligated to investigate the facts and ascertain the complete details to 
ascertain and discover the true f acts. Similar observations were made in the 
Case of Madhu Bala vs. Suresh Kumar , 1998 SCC (Cri) 111.       
60. In Lalita Kumari   (supra),  it has been observed that the law must be 
interpreted to maintain a balance  from both the sides : grievance of the 
victim/i nformant of non -registration of valid FIRs, as well as that of the 
accused of being unnecessarily harassed  and investigated  for charges that 
are found to be  false . The Apex Court after referring to all the aforesaid 
Judgments,  concluded that there is no a mbiguity in regard to the mandatory 
registration of FIR on receipt of complaint disclosing cognizable offence 
under Section 154 CrPC. It was observed as under:   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 22 of 33 
 “44. ….A plain reading of Section 154(1) of the Code 
provides that any information relating to t he commission 
of a cognizable offence if given orally to an officer -in-
charge of a police station shall be reduced into writing by 
him or under his direction.  There is no ambiguity in the 
language of Section 154(1) of the Code. ” 
 
61. Section 154, therefore, ma ndates that when a complaint given in 
writing prima facie discloses a cognizable offence, the Investigating Agency 
is mandatorily required to register the FIR.  
62. Now coming to the facts of present case, a dmittedly, the writte n 
complaint dated 24.11.2003  was made by the Complainant Mr. N.S. Hoon.  
There is not a single averment  made that the allegations made in the 
Complaint did not prima facie disclose a cognizable offence. Investigating 
Agency  registered the FIR as required under Section 154 CrPC . Neither any 
ill intent or  that the defendants were in connivance with the defendant No.4 
Shri N.S. Hoon , is either alleged or made out from the record.   
63. The connected question which arises is whether a preliminary 
enquiry can be conducted before the registration of  FIR.  This aspect was 
again considered in detail in the case of Lalita Kumari  (Supra).  It was 
observed that since the registration of FIR on disclosure of cognizable 
offence in a complaint is a mandatory requirement, the maxim expressio  
unius est exclusio alterius  (expression of one thing is the exclusion of other ) 
gets applie d to the interpretation of Section 154 and thus, for conducting any 
investigation, the registration of FIR is the starting point . It was observed 
that conducting of investigations into  an offence after the registration of FIR 
is the procedure established by law and is thus , in conformity  with Article  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 23 of 33 
 21 of the Constitution.  Thus, the right of an accused under Article 21 of 
Constitution  is protected if the FIR is first registered and then  the 
investigations are undertaken . Twin objects  are achieved by the registration 
of FIR , at the earliest ; one is that the criminal process is set into motion and 
is well -documented from the start ;  and second  the earliest information 
received in relation to the commission of the offence is recorded so that 
there can be no embel lishment etc. later.  
64. It was explained in the case of Thulia Kali vs. State of T amilnadu , 
1972 SCC (Cri) 543,  that on account of the delay, the report not only gets 
bereft  of the adv antage or spontaneity , danger  creaps  of the introduction of 
coloured version , exaggerated account or concocted story  as a result of 
deliberation and consultation.  
65.  In the case of Lalita Kumari  (supra) , it was argued  that a Preliminary  
Enquiry was mandato ry in order to avoid the abuse of arbitrary arrest 
immediately on registration of FIR as it would be contrary to Article 21  of 
the Constitution. A reference was made to the observations of the Apex 
Court in Joginder Kumar vs. State of U.P ., 1994 SCC (Cri) 1172,  wherein it 
was clarified that a pe rson is not liable to arrest merely on the suspicion of 
complicity of an offence ; there must be some reasonable justification  in the 
opinion  of the officer affecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and 
justified. Except in heinous offences , arrest must be avoided if the police 
officer issues Notice  to the person to attend the Police Station and not to 
leave the station , without his permission. It was concluded that it is an 
imaginary fear that merely because FIR has been registered, it would require 
arrest of the accused and thereby le ad to loss of reputation. The remedy lies 
in strictly enforcing the safeguards available against the arbitrary arrest  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 24 of 33 
 made by the police and not in allowing the police  to avoid m andatory 
registration of FIR when the information discloses commission of a 
cognizable offence.  
66. It was clarified in Lalita Kumari  (supra ) that even though FIR 
registration is mandatory , arrest of an accused is not at all mandatory 
immediately on registrat ion of FIR . The registration of FIR and arrest of a 
person are two entirely different aspects  under the law and there are several 
safeguards available against the arrest.  
67. In Lalita Kumari  (supra),  it was thus stated that FIR is the initial point 
for co mme ncement of investigation s and it does not in any way contravene 
the Constitutional protection under Article 21 of the Constitution. It was 
thus held that preliminary enquiry before registration of FIR , is not 
mandated  except in certain cases where prelimin ary enquiry may be 
required owing to the change in genesis and novelty of crimes with the 
passage of time. The types of cases in which a preliminary enquiry may be 
undertaken , were defined as under: - 
(a) Matrimonial disputes/family disputes  
(b) Commercial  offences  
 (c ) Medical negligen ce cases  
 (d) Corruption Cases  
(e) Cases w herein abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal 
prosecution without satisfactory explanation of the reasons for delay. It was 
qualified that such list of category of cases, was no t exhaustive of all 
conditions, which may warrant preliminary enquiry.  
68. Thus, there are specific guidelines which are to be followed by the 
police before an arrest is made and the Magistrate is also required to ensure  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 25 of 33 
 that the arrest made is in accordance with law before further detention is 
authorised.  
69. In the present case , considering the compl exity of allegations made in 
the complaint, the I.O. made thorough preliminary inquiries which spread 
over nine mon ths to find if it prima facie disclosed commission  of 
cognizable offence,  before registering the FIR.  According to the plaintiffs 
themselves, they joined the investigations before registration of FIR and 
handed over the documents as sought by the I.O. Even thereafter, the arrest 
has been made after two mo nths.  
70. Significantly, on their arrest the Court granted police custody of two 
days, for effective investigation s and thereafter they were sent to judicial 
custody. In the case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar  (2014) 8 SCC 273, 
the Apex Court cautioned tha t ""before a Magistrate authorises detention 
under Section 167 CrPC, he has to be first satisfied that the arrest made is 
legal and in accordance with law and all the constitutional rights of the 
person arrested are satisfied. If the arrest effected by the police officer does 
not satisfy the requirements of Section 41 of the Code, Magistrate is duty -
bound not to authorise his further detention and release the accused. In other 
words, when an accused is produced before the Magistrate, the police officer 
effec ting the arrest is required to furnish to the Magistrate, the facts, reasons 
and its conclusions for arrest and the Magistrate in turn is to be satisfied that 
the condition precedent for arrest under Section 41 CrPC has been satisfied 
and it is only therea fter that he will authorise the detention of an accused"".  
71. There is no averment made by the plaintiffs that the arrest was made 
in contradiction of the guidelines enumerated by the Apex Court in the case 
of Arnesh Kumar (Supra) . The arrest  could have been t ermed as motivated  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 26 of 33 
 and malicious had the arrest been made on the asking of the complainant 
without any basis , which is not the case . The arrest, therefore, cannot be 
termed as illegal  since it was for the purpose of interrogation and 
investigation  to esta blish complicity of the plaintiffs in the alleged acts .  
72. Moreover , the Charge Sheet shows  that in support of the allegations 
made by Shri N.S. Hoon,  during the investigations, documents were seized 
from the plaintiffs such as Member Client Agreements betw een the 
Complainant and the Plaintiffs’ Company, Individual client registration 
carrying name, address and signature of Sh.  N.S. Hoon, introducers - S/Sh. 
Girish Aggarwal & Sunil Singhania , Risk Disclosure Documents , Letter 
dated 29.04.02 which prima facie  did disclose commission of the offence . 
Investigations were required to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations 
made in the Complaint. Thus, it cannot be said that there was no evidence 
found by the Investigating  Agency  for registration of FIR, the veracity of 
which could have been established only through investigations . Further,  on 
the filing of the Charge Sheet , the Court also did not deem it appropriate to 
discharge the plaintiffs  but they were remanded to police custody for two 
days and thereaft er to judicial custody ; thus neither the arrest nor the 
detention cannot be termed as illegal  or malafide . 
73. As already noticed above, the plaintiffs were denied bail four times by 
the Court s, before they were granted Bail by this Court,  in which the 
Investi gating Agency had the limited role of only presenting the 
investigations that were being carried out by them.  
74. A reference to the Order dated 10.11.2004 of the learned M.M. shows 
that while considering the bail application of the plaintiffs , the Court 
dism issed the application  in view the nature of the offence , which included   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 27 of 33 
 forgery , and the amount involved . The relevant part of the Order reads as 
under:  
“Arguments heard. The contentions of the Ld. Counsel for 
the accused are in  Lines to the averments con tained in the 
application. Against the Complainant certain material has 
been shown showing his involvement in other cases also. 
From the material shows it indeed suggests that the 
Complainant has been involved in other cases also. Here it 
may be mentioned that on the first date of hearing when the 
accused was produced after the arrest the Complaint denied 
being involved in any litigation whatsoever. Be that as it 
may. 1 have considered the present bail application as per 
the material of this case. The conte ntion raised by the 
Counsel for the accused in detail are also mentioned that 
the bail application  which 1 have perused. However, 
besides other allegations, the prosecution  case is also that 
accused persons forged certain documents while committing 
cheatin g in the present case which is still being investigated. 
So far as the transaction is concerned, the same is not 
denied by the accused but on behalf of the accused 
contentions were raised that the dispute is of evil nature 
since every penny of the Complain ant was accounted for 
and there was no inducement and no cheating has been 
committed. It is also submitted that the Complainant is 
conveniently denying his signatures to make out a case of 
forgery. I have given thoughtful considerations to the 
contentions raise on behalf both the sides. We need not go 
into much detail while, passing the present hail order. 
Police file which I have perused does show some complicity 
of the accused persons. The case is still at the stage of 
investigation.  
Keeping in view the n ature of the offence including forgery 
and the amount   
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 28 of 33 
 involved I am not inclined to accept the hail application of 
the accused at  
this stage. Bail application is rejected.”  
75. The observations in this Order as well establishes that the complaint 
required inve stigations and the acts of Defendants were not motivated by 
any malice or ulterior design. The Bail applications  were time and again 
dismissed by the learned MM . The plaintiff may have got the bail after 
about six months but that in no way, can be attribu ted to any misconduct of  
defendants No.1, 2 and 3.  
76. The obligation on the State Agency was to complete the investigations 
in 90 days ; since the plaintiff s were  in custody , the needful was done by the 
Police  and the Charge Sheet was filed within time , on 29.12.2004 .  The due 
process of law has been followed and no ulterior motive can be attributed to 
the defendants  in either ensuring that the complaint disclosed a prima facie 
cognizable offence by holding a preliminary inquiry and then registering the 
FIR. 
 
Whether the defendants  deliberately withheld and suppressed the 
available Exculpatory  evidence while filing the Charge Sheet in the Court : 
77. The defendants had during the investigations had sought the Auditors 
Report in respect of the share transactions and t he investments allegedly 
made by the complainant, to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations 
made in the complaint.  
78. The plaintiffs have claimed that the maliciousness of the defendants is 
evident as the Audit Report  exonerating the plaintiffs , had b een received in 
the Police Station on 25.12.2004 and was forwarded to the I.O. on  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 29 of 33 
 27.12.2004 . However, the Charge Sheet was filed in the Court on 
29.12.2004 without placing the Audit Report on record  and that it was 
deliberately suppressed.  
79. A perusal of t he Audit Report referred to by the plaintiffs shows that 
the Auditors  verifi ed the relevant Books of accounts, documents,  papers 
pertaining to the above case  and provided their conclusions therein. In the 
Report it was stated that the Comp laint made by Shr i N.S. Hoon was 
contradictory and confusing on various points. It was stated that there was 
neither  any Loan Agreement between the accused persons and Mr. N.S. 
Hoon nor  any need of making payment of interest by the accused persons to 
Mr. N.S.  Hoon.  The fin al Analysis arrived at by the Auditors read s as under - 
“From the aforesaid observations and also relying upon the 
supporting documents produced to us,we are of the firm 
opinion that there has been quite heavy share trading by Mr. 
N.S. Hoon through the accu sed persons, as a result of which 
Mr. N.S. Hoon lost quite heavily due to fluctuation in share 
prices. There has been no such agreement / contract or any 
other document between Mr. N.S. Hoon and the accused 
persons given to us to prove tha t there has been any loan 
transaction between them. Mr. Hoon was locally contacted 
on phone on 23/12/2004 to give any other proof of lending 
money to Gupta Brothers i.e. O.J. Financial Services Ltd. 
and O.J. Securities Pvt. Ltd. The Phone was attended by Mrs. 
Meera Ahuja a nd she informed that Mr. N.S. Hoon is away to 
Calcutta. After some time Mr. N.S. Hoon phoned back to us 
from Calcutta and denied having had any such written 
agreement with O.J. Financial Services Ltd. or O.J. 
Securities Pvt. Ltd. He denied having had any o ther 
document to prove his contention.”  
 
80. The above report provided the analysis of the Auditor and gave  an 
opinion that there was heavy share trading between the parties. It  may be  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 30 of 33 
 observed that the Report did not completely  exonerate the plaintiffs of al l 
the charges  against them but it only point ed out the contradictions in the 
complaint made by Shri N.S. Hoon.   
81. Regarding the Audit Report not being filed with the Charge Sheet is 
concerned,  the defendants have explained that the Report was received on 
25.12.200 4 and marked to the I.O. on 27.12.200 4 but the same was not filed 
as there were further clarifications needed.  
82. Further, it has been contended by the plaintiff that the GEQD/FSL 
Report dated 31.01.2005, which verified the signatures of the complainan t 
and absolved them of the charges of forgery, was only partly  filed in the 
Court on  05.02.2005 and  the complete Report was filed only on 03.03.2005 .  
83. In this regard, the defendants have stated that they had  received the 
GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005 o nly on 01.02.2005 which opined  
“that there was no divergence in the signatures sent for comparison and it 
leads to the conclusion that the documents were not forged” . The defendants 
in their Written Statement had explained that the same was partially filed  
deliberately at first, since certain clarifications in the report were needed 
from the concerned laboratory. Though it is not specified in the Written 
Statement what the nature of the clarifications were, however, the complete 
Report was filed on 03.03.20 05 i.e. one month after it was received. There 
might have been a delay by the Investigating Authority ; however, the same 
cannot be termed as malicious.   
84. The Court in its Order dated 20.01.2005  while considering the Bail 
application , commented  adverse ly ab out non-filing of the Audit Report  in 
the next line itself the Court stated that, “However, the question which 
arises is that the fact of not producing the chartered accountant's report and  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 31 of 33 
 other facts of merits entitles the accused persons to bail or not ”. The Court 
then proceed s to determine the question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled 
to bail based on the Charge Sheet and the materials placed on record, which 
made out a very grave offence. The final part of the Order reads as under:  
“I have peruse d the chargesheet and the material available 
on record.  Even if chartered accountant's report not filing 
gives rise to suspicion  against the prosecution but still in my 
considered view, the material makes  out a very grave offence 
in the present case. In th e present case, the  complainant 
came in contact with both these accused persons through one  
Sunil Singhania who is absconding. The accused  persons is 
stated to have induced the Complainant who invested a large  
amount promising 1.5% monthly interest in addi tion to 
bonds. The  Complainant deposited certain cash and shares 
with the accused. The  interest was paid for some time but 
thereafter was discontinued. The Complainant submits that 
an amount of Rs. 3.5 crores have been cheated by  the 
accused persons. Simil arly, another Complainant R.S. 
Hoon and Mira  Ahuja were cheated of a substantive 
amount. Even if the chartered  accountant's report has not 
been filed still in my view a very grave offence  of large 
amount of cheating is made out in the present case.  It is n ot 
that the  offences against him paid are only to be considered 
as grave but even the  economic offences are eating out the 
economy of this country. In my  considered view, after giving 
thoughtful consideration to all the contentions  raised in the 
applicatio n and as orally contended no ground for bail of 
the accused persons is made out keeping in view gravity of 
the offence. There  is no need to discuss further details of 
evidence in the present bail order.  The application for bail is 
accordingly dismissed. Fi le be put up on the date  already 
fixed. ”  
85. Thus, it was in view of the gravity of the offence that the bail 
application of the pla intiffs was dismissed . There might have been a delay 
by the Investigating Agency in producing the Audit Report  or the FSL  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 32 of 33 
 Repor t, however, the same cannot be said to be the sole reason for  their 
detention  as there was other material as well and delay in filing  the 
Auditor’s Report cannot be termed as malicious.  
86. As a general rule the Police Officer is bound to lay before the learn ed 
M.M., information relevant to establish the commission of criminal offence 
which has reasonable and probable link to the commission of the offence 
which leads to arrest, trial and punishment of the offender.  
87. Undeniably, it was on the application of the plaintiffs that further 
investigations were done which ultimately culminated in the filing 
Cancellation Report by the Investigating Authority . However, the Report  
was not only based on the Report of the Accounting Expert dated 
25.12.2004 and the GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005 , but they have also 
relied on the letters sent to the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock 
Exchange to verify the transaction executed by M/s O.J. Securities Pvt. Ltd. 
in the account  of Mr. N.S. Hoon . The reply was received in 2 008. Further, 
clarifications were also sought by the Investigating Authority from Sandeep 
Ramesh Gupta & Company, Chartered Ac countants  during the course of 
Investigation . Thus, from the Cancellation Report it is evident that the 
Investigating  Agency  condu cted a thorough investigation into the offences 
alleged against the Plaintiffs  and the same cannot be stated to be malicious.  
Conclusion  
88. In the present case , the plaintiff has not been able to show that there 
was any malice or any intentional wrong committ ed by the defendants in 
following the due process of law in prosecuting the plaintiff.  In fact, they 
had acted diligently and during the investigations, had sought the FSL 
Report as well as the Audit Report in order to investigate thoroughly in the  
CS (OS) No.  124/20 16                                                                                               Page 33 of 33 
 compla int made by the complainant Shri N.S. Hoon. The defendants, 
therefore, took the requisite steps for verification of the signatures of the 
plaintiff on the various Share Certificate s which had been alleged by the 
complainant to be false and fabricated.  The re may have been some delay in 
being diligent in filing the requisite Reports , but there is no averment that 
withholding of the Reports was intentional or with any malice.  Even if all 
the averments of the plaintiff are accepted , then too no malice is disc losed in 
the acts of the Police/ defendants which were done by them in discharge of 
their official duty.  It cannot be said  that the acts of defendants were lacking 
good faith.   Therefore, no case is made out for grant of damages on account 
of malicious pro secution  against the defendants . 
89. The suit is held to be not maintainable and is hereby dismissed.

     J    U    D    G    M    E    N    T
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
1. The plaintiffs have claimed Recovery of Damages in the sum of Rs.15 Crores for intentional illegal detention, malicious prosecution and Tort of abuse of process of Court.
2. The plaintiff No.1 Arun Gupta is a B.Com (Hons), LLB, ICWA and MBA, having secured second position in B.Com (Hons) from Shri Ram College of Commerce, University of Delhi, Gold Medalist in ICWA and secured second position in MBA from Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi. He is a prominent share broker since 1990 and is an active member of different Trade Associations, Professional Bodies, Sports Associations, Social & Cultural Organizations, Residents Bodies, Hospital Trust and Alumni Association. Plaintiff Nos.1 and 2 are brothers.
3. The plight of the plaintiffs started when they received a Notice dated 18.12.2003 from EOW requiring their appearance on 22.12.2003 upon a complaint dated 24.12.2003 made against them by Shri N.S. Hoon (defendant no.4). The EOW conducted its inquiry for about nine months during which the plaintiffs fully cooperated and appeared as and when required and produced the documents as required by EOW.  Eventually, without their knowledge an FIR No.221/2004 dated 25.08.2004 under Sections 406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC was registered against them.  Pursuant thereto, they were arrested on 03.11.2004, just a few days before Diwali, without any basis or evidence. The Investigating Authority should have collected the documentary evidence to substantiate the bald allegations made in the complaint that funds had been remitted by way of cheques and shares, as loan by the complainant to the plaintiffs, before registering the FIR and arresting the plaintiffs as it is the duty of the State Machinery to first collect evidence to substantiate the allegations mentioned in the complaint. 
4. It is further alleged that the Charge Sheet dated 27.12.2004 wrongly stated that the Report from Accounting Expert was awaited even though it had already been received in EOW, on 25.12.2004. The Accounting Expert Report dated 23.12.2004, found no fraud in the accounts maintained for the transactions carried out by the complainant, but it was intentionally and deliberately suppressed. No reason has been stated by the Investigating Agency for such delay of three years in filing the Accounting Expert Report before the Court. Further, the EOW received the GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005, which confirmed that all the documents in question bore the original signatures of the complainant and suggested that there was no forgery committed, but was only partially filed in the Court on 05.02.2005.  Thus, the two reports prove that the plaintiffs were innocent and arrested without any basis. 
5. It is asserted that the purpose of investigation is to collect the evidence and to find out the truthfulness of the allegations, as emphasized by the Supreme Court in various judgements. The allegations of cheating and forgery should have been verified before arresting the plaintiffs; in fact, it was only on 24.11.2004, i.e. after the arrest of the plaintiffs, that the documents relating to business relationships between the plaintiffs and complaint was sent to FSL and an Accountant for verification and audit, respectively. Thus, the actions of the Investigation Authority by firstly, not collecting the requisite evidence prior to the arrest and secondly, deliberately withholding and suppressing the available evidence, makes the prosecution malicious.
6. The plaintiffs filed Crl. M.C. 2183/2005 & Crl. M.C.2184/2005 for quashing of the FIR before this Court on 20.05.2005, but were dismissed on 25.04.2007 by a neutral Order and the matter was referred back to the Trial Court.  
7. An application dated 07.07.2007 was filed by the plaintiffs before the framing of charge, for further investigations on various points under Section 173 (8) of Cr.P.C. The I.O. appeared before the Learned Magistrate on 04.08.2007 and informed that further investigations are being undertaken which went on for about three years after which a Cancellation Report/ Final Report dated 25.06.2010 under Section 173 (8) of Cr.P.C, was filed by EOW. 
8. It is claimed that there were inherent contradictions in the allegations as in the Charge Sheet, while on one hand it was stated that the Delivery Instruction Slips were forged; on the other hand, it stated that the shares were given on Loan.  There was malicious arrest of the plaintiffs and no explanation has been given as to why no Cancellation Report instead of Charge Sheet was filed in the first instance. Hence, the plaintiffs have claimed that the State machinery is guilty of taking away the right of the plaintiffs to live with dignity and integrity by arresting them without proper verification of the allegations, which continued for seven years before the Cancellation Report was finally submitted.
9. The complainant filed a Protest Petition on 22.1.2010 which was dismissed by the Trial Court vide Order dated 03.03.2011.  The Cancellation Report was accepted and the plaintiffs were discharged. A Revision Petition No.444/2011 was filed by the complainant on 26.08.2011 before this Court along with an application for Condonation of Delay. The matter on 30.11.2011 was referred by this Court to SEBI. The plaintiffs appeared before SEBI on 26.04.2012 and explained the facts.  SEBI gave its affidavit on 22.01.2013 and the Revision Petition was dismissed by this Court on 26.09.2013. This Order to the knowledge of the plaintiffs, has not been challenged by the complainant.
  
10. The plaintiffs have further asserted that the arrest of the plaintiffs was widely reported in newspapers and T.V which not only led to huge financial losses as they had to sell at a throw away price, their shares in property at Mausam Vihar, Delhi, but it also created problem in the marriage of their children.  Restrictions were put on the Companies of the plaintiff to trade w.e.f. 04.11.2004 by National Stock Exchange which were lifted only on 01.07.2005 after the Disciplinary Action Committee of the Stock Exchange gave a personal hearing to the plaintiffs on 30.06.2005, at Mumbai. The plaintiffs goodwill touched rock bottom and the debtors of the plaintiffs delayed the payments while the creditors knocked at their doors to take their money.  The Post Office Department has still not renewed their Agency and J& K Bank had not renewed plaintiffs DP Operations.  Many clients have left them. The plaintiffs had to give formal representations to Broker Associations and even to their own Residents Welfare Association in August, 2005, after their release from jail to prove their innocence.
11. The plaintiffs then filed a Writ Petition bearing No.7465/2014 on 25.09.2014 to claim damages in the sum of Rs.100 crores.  An objection was taken by learned counsel for Delhi State and Delhi Police on 03.11.2014 that Writ was not an appropriate remedy and the plaintiff should claim damages by way of a suit. This Court in its Order dated 11.02.2016 observed that disputed question of facts were involved, and the Writ petition was withdrawn by the plaintiff with the liberty to file a Civil Suit.
12. Hence, the plaintiffs have claimed Rs.15 Crores along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of their arrest till payment as damages for physical, mental, financial losses and for lowering of image, status, reputation in Society and also for their wrongful acts and detention in jail.
13. The defendant No.2 in its Written Statement (which was adopted by defendant No.1 Vide order dated 25.04.2017) explained that the complainant, Shri N.S. Hoon, had filed a complaint dated 24.11.2003 against the plaintiffs, alleging that the plaintiffs had cheated him of Rs.3.50 crores and for misappropriation of funds, in EOW. 
14. It is stated that the Investigating Agency diligently enquired into the facts and circumstances surrounding the complaint for about nine months and eventually registered the FIR No.221/2004 dated 25.08.2004 under Section 406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC.  During the course of the investigation, the plaintiff was arrested as it was required at that point of time and the factum of arrest was duly informed to the family members of the plaintiffs. It is asserted that there was sufficient ground/evidence to arrest the plaintiffs and it is denied that the arrest was made mala fide.  It is claimed that the investigations were done diligently, and the arrest was made after nine months of the complaint having been received in the office, and that too after rigorous enquiry.  
15. It was further submitted that it is a well-settled principle that in a case of malicious prosecution, there must be no reasonable or probable cause for the prosecution. In the present matter, there was reasonable cause for the defendants to proceed with the prosecution as there was prima facie evidence to suggest that transactions between the complainant and plaintiffs had taken place.
16. As per procedure, in compliance of Section 57/167 of Cr.P.C, the plaintiff was produced before the learned Judicial Magistrate and the entire case was put before him, along with the application for the plaintiffs remand in police custody. On being satisfied, police custody of the plaintiffs was granted on 03.11.2004 for two days. Thereafter, the plaintiffs were again produced before the learned Judicial Magistrate and based on the grounds of the arrest, the plaintiffs were sent to Judicial Custody. 
17. It is asserted by the defendant that from the date of the arrest on 03.11.2004 till the Charge Sheet was filed on 29.12.2004, the judicial remand for custody was granted by the learned Court time and again and at no point of time did the Court observe that the plaintiffs were arrested without any ground. Further, the plaintiffs filed bail applications four times, but they were all dismissed by observing that the allegation against the plaintiffs were very grave. It is pointed out that the bail under Section 439 Cr.P.C. was also dismissed by the learned ASJ as a huge amount was involved in the case. 
18.  The defendant has explained that when new facts came to light and to the knowledge of EOW, the matter was further investigated and brought to the notice of the Court and on finding that the allegations against the plaintiffs were not substantiated, the Final Report/ Cancellation Report was accordingly submitted.  
19. It is explained that the Report of the Accounting Expert was received in the office of EOW on 25.12.2004 and was handed over to the I.O on 27.12.2004. It is because certain clarifications were required in the Report from concerned Accounting Expert/ C.A., that the Report could not be filed on 29.12.2004 along with the Charge Sheet. The defendant asserted that the FSL/GEQD and Audit Report dated 31.01.2005 were only received by the EOW on 1.02.2005 and it is explained that the report was filed partially as certain clarifications in the Report were needed from the concerned laboratory.  
20. Further investigations were directed to be conducted on the points raised by the plaintiffs and a detailed investigation was carried out and eventually a Cancellation Report was filed under Section 173(8) of Cr.P.C on 08.07.2010. 
21. It is denied that there was any malice in the acts of the answering defendants.  It is also denied that the plaintiffs are entitled to any damages on account of loss of reputation or for mental/ physical trauma on account of acts of the defendants.
22. The plaintiffs in their Replication to the Written Statement denied the assertions made by the defendant Nos. 1 and 2.
23.  Defendant No. 3 failed to file the Written Statement within the  Statutory period and was proceeded ex-parte vide Order dated 29.08.2016.
24. During the course of the proceedings, the suit has been rejected vide Order dated 03.12.2018 against defendant No.4, the complainant Shri N.S. Hoon, as being barred by limitation. 
25. Upon the rejection of the suit against the complainant, the question that arose was whether the Suit was maintainable against defendant Nos. 1 to 3, as the cognizance was taken on the Charge Sheet by the Court and had eventually accepted the Cancellation Report.
26. Arguments were addressed on behalf of the parties on the maintainability of the suit.
27. The plaintiffs filed a Written Synopsis on the issue of maintainability of the suit wherein it was asserted that a suit can be dismissed or rejected at the initial stage only under Order 7 rule 11 CPC and there is no application in this regard by the defendants. It was asserted that the present suit involves intricate questions of law and facts which can be adjudicated only after the complete trial. 
28. It was further asserted that Order 7 Rule 11 of the CPC has limited application and it must be shown from the averments made in the Plaint that the Suit is barred under any law, to attract its application. Reliance was placed on the case of C. Natranjan v. Ashim Bai & Anr 2008 AIR (SC) 363; Bhau Ram vs Janak Singh 2012 AIR (SC) 3023; Mayar H.K Ltd vs Owners & Parties Vessel M.V.Fortune Express AIR 2006 SC 1828; Ramesh B Desai vs Bipin Vadilal Mehta AIR 2006 SC 3672; Balasria Construction (p) Ltd vs Hanuman Seva Trust & other 2006 (5) SCC 658; and Popat And Kotecha Property vs State Bank of India Staff Association 2005 (7) SCC 510. 
29. The Plaintiff asserted that the proceedings were instituted by the defendant without any reasonable and probable cause in the instant matter, and the Complainant did not provide any relevant documents to substantiate his complaint. Further, the Investigating Agency also did not try to find out the truth and it was only after the application under Section 173(8) CrPC was filed by the plaintiffs that the Investigating Agency came out with the truth that no relevant documents have been filed by the Complainant to substantiate the claims.
30. The plaintiff contended that as i) there was no probable cause for instituting the prosecution; and ii) the prosecution or suit terminated favorably to the defendant, the suit for malicious prosecution was maintainable. Reliance was placed on the case of West Bengal State Electricity v. Dilip Kumar Ray AIR 2007 SC 976; S. Nambi Narayan vs. Siby Mathews (2018) 10 SCC 804 in this regard.
31. It was asserted that no arrest can be made merely because it is lawful for the police officer to do so, as the arrest and detention in police lock-up of a person can cause incalculable harm to the reputation and self-esteem of a person. Reliance was placed on the case of D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997) 1 SCC 416; S. Nambi Narayan (Supra); Joginder Kumar v. State of U.P. and Ors. (1994) 4 SCC 260; Pankaj Kumar Sharma v. GNTCD & Ors in W.P. (C) 3851 of 2023 dated 05.10.2023; Nilabati Behera alias Lalita Bahera v State of Orissa 1993 (2) SCC 746; Harshendra Kumar D. v Rebatilata Koley etc. (2011) 3 SCC 351; Kiran Bedi v. Committee of Inquiry and Anr (1989) 25 SCC 494; Vishwanath Agrawal v. Sarla Vishwanath Agrawal (2012) 7 SCC 288; Bhim Singh MLA v State AIR 1986 SC 494; Prempal & Others v. CP and Others 2010 ILR Delhi 416; Saheli v. C.P. Delhi Police AIR 1990 SC 513; State of Rajasthan v. Mst. Vidyawati and another, 1962 AIR  SC 933; Bhola Kumhar v. State of Chhattisgarh, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 837; Manoharan v. State of Tamil, 2021 SCC OnLine Mad 1036; and Delhi Judicial Service Association v. State of Gujarat and Ors 19913 SCR 936 to highlight the impact of malicious prosecution, malicious arrest, illegal arrest and malicious investigation.
32. It was argued that anyone who has been the victim of unlawful arrest or detention  has an enforceable right to compensation as for the infraction of the right to life, the only practical form of redressal is by awarding monetary damages. It was asserted that where the infringement of right is established, the Court cannot stop by giving a mere declaration and it must give compensatory relief as has been observed in the case of Rudul Sah vs State of Bihar, (1983) 4 SCC 141 and Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain vs The State of U.P, AIR 1965 SC 1039.
33. It was further argued that the investigations should be judicious, fair, transparent and expeditious to ensure compliance with the basic rule of law. Reliance was placed on the case of Mithilesh Kumar Singh v. State of Rajasthan 2015 9 SCC 795; Nirmal Singh Kahlon v. State of Punjab and Others (2009) 1 SCC 441; and Sidhartha Vashistha alias Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi) (2010) 6 SCC 1.
34. The learned counsel for defendant Nos. 1 to 3 relied on the dicta of Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh (2014) 2 SCC 1, to contend that it is mandatory for the State machinery to register an FIR immediately on receiving a complaint of commission of an offence and, therefore, the acts of answering defendants were in accordance with Law. The suit does not disclose any cause of action against the answering defendants and must be dismissed as not maintainable.  
35. Submissions heard.
The claim of the plaintiffs for damages rests on their averments that they were maliciously prosecuted by the defendants.

Understanding Malicious Prosecution:
36. The plaintiffs have sought damages stating that they were subjected to  malicious prosecution and the proceedings against them have led to lowering of their reputation and esteem in public eye.
37. At this point it is pertinent to understand the law on Malicious Prosecution. Bouvier defined a malicious act as 'a wrongful act, intentionally done, without cause or excuse. 
38. The Salmond on Torts, 11th edu., p. 742, defined the  lack of reasonable or probable cause as follows-
Reasonable and probable cause means a genuine belief, based on reasonable grounds, that the proceedings are justified.
39. American Jurisprudence, pp. 731-732 (S. 47), defines probable cause as follows:
Many definitions of the term probable cause as used in actions for malicious prosecution, differing more or less in their language, are to be found in the decisions. Thus, for instance, probable cause for a criminal prosecution has been defined as a reasonable ground for suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to warrant a cautious, or as some Courts put it, a prudent man in the belief that the party is guilty of the offence with which he is charged as the existence of such facts and circumstances as would excite belief in a reasonable mind, acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor, that the person charged was guilty of the offence for which he was prosecuted, and as such facts and circumstances as, when communicated to the generality of men of ordinary and impartial minds, are sufficient to raise in them a belief or real, grave suspicion of the guilt of the person. With reference to civil actions, probable cause has been said to be such reason supported by facts and circumstances as will warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action and the means taken in prosecuting it are legally just and proper. Probable cause in this connection, does not mean sufficient cause; and the question in the action is not whether there was in fact a sufficient cause for the prosecution or proceeding complained of, since the acquittal or failure of the proceeding shows that there was not. A definition sufficiently exact to meet satisfactorily every possible test would be difficult, if not impossible, to furnish for the complete legal idea expressed by the term probable cause is not to be gathered from a mere definition. However, notwithstanding the different wordings of the many judicial definitions before referred to, there seems to be sufficient substantial agreement among them to warrant the statement that the standard of conduct for beginning or continuing any proceeding, whether civil or criminal, is that of a reasonable or ordinarily prudent man placed in the same situation as the defendant. That is, if a reasonable man would have believed and acted under the circumstances as the defendant did, there would be probable cause; otherwise not. It is to be noted that the conduct of the defendant is to be weighed in view of what appeared to him at the time of instituting the prior proceeding, not in the light of subsequently appearing facts.

40. The term 'malice,' as used in the expression 'malicious prosecution' is not to be considered in the sense of spite or hatred against an individual, but of malus animus, and as denoting that the party is actuated by improper and indirect motives.
41. The principles to be borne in mind in the case of actions for malicious prosecutions is that Malice is not merely the doing of a wrongful act intentionally but it must be established that the defendant was actuated by malus animus, that is to say, by spite or ill will or any indirect or improper motive. But if the defendant had reasonable or probable cause of launching the criminal prosecution no amount of malice will make him liable for damages. Reasonable and probable cause must be such as would operate on the mind of a discreet and reasonable man; 'malice' and 'want of reasonable and probable cause,' have reference to the state of the defendant's mind at the date of the initiation of criminal proceedings and the onus rests on the plaintiff to prove them.
42. In the case of the State of Bihar through District Magistrate, Bhagalpur v. Rameshwar Prasad Badiya & anr. 1980 SCC OnLine Pat 38, Apex Court explained that Malice and absence of reasonable and probable cause must unite in order to produce liability. Malice in common acceptation means ill-will against a person, but in its legal sense it means a wrongful act, done intentionally, without just cause or excuse. Malice signifies the presence of some improper and wrongful motivethat is to say, an intent to use the legal process in question for some other than its legally appointed and appropriate purpose. Reasonable and probable cause means a genuine belief, based on reasonable grounds, that the proceedings are justified.
43. The Apex Court in the case of West Bengal State Electricity Board vs. Dilip Kumar Ray (2007) 14 SCC 568 discussed various facets of malice.  It observed that there may be malice in fact or malice in law.  Malice in fact  relates to actual state or condition of mind of the person who did the act, while Malice in law simply means a depraved inclination on the part of a person to disregard the rights of others, which intent is manifested by his injurious acts.
44. The Apex Court in West Bengal State Electricity Board (supra) further drew a distinction between malicious abuse of legal process and malicious abuse of process.  It was observed that while the former consisted of malicious misuse or misapplication of process to accomplish a purpose not warranted or commanded by the order of the Court like malicious perversion of a regularly issued process, whereby an improper result is secured,  the malicious abuse of process means wilfully misapplying court process to obtain object not intended by law.  For instance, initiation of vexatious civil proceedings known to be groundless is not abuse of process, but is governed by substantially the same rules as the malicious prosecution of criminal proceedings. It was further iterated that the term 'malicious prosecution' imports a causeless as well as an ill-intended prosecution on some charge of crime which is willful, wanton, reckless, or against the prosecutor's sense of duty and right, or for ends he knows or is bound to know are wrong and against the dictates of  public policy.
45. In malicious prosecution there are two essential elements, namely, that no probable cause existed for instituting the prosecution or suit complained of, and that such prosecution or suit terminated in some way favorably to the defendant therein.
46. The Apex Court Rameshwar Prasad Badiya & anr. (supra) observed that the defendant in an action for malicious prosecution is not required to believe that the accused is guilty; it is enough if he believes there is reasonable and probable cause for a prosecution. He need only be satisfied that there is a proper case to lay before the court. It may not always be possible to have direct evidence of these two requirements of a suit for malicious prosecution but the connected relevant circumstances may sometimes furnish a clue to the same. It propounded the following four conditions to succeed in a suit for malicious prosecution:
(1) that the proceedings must have been instituted or continued by the defendant; (2) that he must have acted without reasonable and probable cause; (3) that he must have acted maliciously; and (4) that the proceedings must have been unsuccessful that is to say, must have terminated in favour of the plaintiff.

47. Similar conditions for malicious prosecution, had been  laid down by the Privy Council in the case of Mohammad Amin v. Jogendra Kumar, AIR 1947 PC 108.
48. In the light of above propositions, the facts of this case may be examined to ascertain whether the plaintiffs have been able to show that, (i) act of defendants is a wrongful act done intentionally;  and (ii) it  was done without a reasonable or probable cause. 
Was the registration of Complaint and consequent Investigations/arrest of the plaintiffs by the Defendants, wrongful:
49. The plaintiff has alleged that he was arrested without any evidence and thus, he has sought damages and compensation on account of his alleged illegal arrest for six months from 03.11.2004 to 26.04.2005. 
50. It is also asserted by him that evidence, such as Reports exonerating him were deliberately suppressed by the Investigating Agency and that the entire  prosecution was malicious in nature. 
51. It is not in dispute that a complaint was made by the complainant Shri N.S. Hoon dated 24.12.2003 against the plaintiffs wherein it was alleged that  he was a non-resident Indian and Chairman of Turner Morrison & Graham Group of Company. He had been approached by M/s OJ Financial Services Ltd, owned by plaintiff no.1 and 2 which is purportedly a Renowned Security & Financial Company of Delhi Operation in April 2002, through a share broker, Sunil Singhania. He had been told that the plaintiffs would  pay interest @ Rs. 1.5 % per month on cash deposit as well as on the deposit of Public quoted acceptable Shares calculated on current quoted prices. He was incentivized to invest money with the plaintiffs. However, they stopped paying him interest from November onwards and alleged that the complainant had been defrauded and cheated him to the tune of Rs. 3.5 cr. 
52. The question before this Court for consideration is whether the defendant Nos. 1 to 3 did not collecting the requisite evidence prior to the arrest; and whether they 	deliberately withheld and suppressed the available evidence while filing the Charge Sheet in the Court. 
Non collection of the requisite evidence prior to the arrest:
53. The EOW conducted an initial inquiry on this complaint, for about nine months after which the FIR No. 221/2004 under Section 406/409/420/467/468/477A/120B of IPC was registered on 25.08.2004, against the plaintiffs. Thereafter, the plaintiffs were arrested on 03.11.2004 i.e. after about two months of registration of FIR.  Pertinently, the Investigating Officer sought Police Remand for interrogation and investigations which was allowed for two days and thereafter, the plaintiffs were sent to judicial custody by the Court.  It is also not in dispute that the Bail applications of the plaintiffs were rejected four times by learned Metropolitan Magistrate and Additional Sessions Judge and they were eventually granted bail after six months of their arrest, by this Court on 26.04.2005.
54. Chapter 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the information to the Police and their powers to investigate. It lays out the procedure to be followed during investigations to set the criminal law in motion and  provides for all procedural safeguards so as to ensure that the investigation is fair and is not malafide and that there is no tampering with the evidence collected during the investigations.
55.  Section 154 Cr.P.C. reads as under:-
Section 154.	Information in cognizable cases.
(1) Every information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to the informant; and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf:
     Provided..
(2).
(3).

56. The contours of Section 154 have been questioned many a times. The legislative intent behind Section 154 as is elaborated in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 as under:
49. Consequently, the condition that is sine qua non for recording an FIR under Section 154 of the Code is that there must be information and that information must disclose a cognizable offence. If any information disclosing a cognizable offence is led before an officer in charge of the police station satisfying the requirement of Section 154(1), the said police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the prescribed form, that is to say, to register a case on the basis of such information. The provision of Section 154 of the Code is mandatory and the concerned officer is duty bound to register the case on the basis of information disclosing a cognizable offence. Thus, the plain words of Section 154(1) of the Code have to be given their literal meaning.

57. The Apex Court in the case of Bhajan Lal (supra), emphasized that at the stage of registration of a crime on the basis of the information disclosing a cognizable offence under Section 154(1) of the CrPC, the police officer concerned cannot embark upon any enquiry as to whether the information laid by the complainant is reliable or credible. In fact, the Office In charge of Police Station is statutorily obliged to register a case and then to proceed with the investigation, if he has reason to suspect the commission of an offence, which he is empowered by virtue of Section 156, subject to the proviso of Section 157.
58. It was further explained in Bhajan Lal (supra), that under 154(1) of the CrPC, the legislature in its collective wisdom, has carefully and cautiously used the expression ""information"" without qualifying it as reasonable complaint and credible information as used in Section 41(1)(a) or (g) of the Code. Evidently, non-qualification of the word information under Section 154 (1) was for the reason that Police Officer should not refuse to record an information relating to commission of a cognizable offence or to register the FIR thereon, on the ground that he is not satisfied with the reasonableness or credibility of the information. In other words, 'reasonableness and credibility' is not a condition precedent for registration of FIR. Therefore, it is has to necessarily follow that if the complaint discloses a cognizable offence, the Police Officer has no discretion and the use of word ""shall"" in Section 154(1) implies that it is a mandatory duty on the police officer to register the FIR. The only condition sine quo non for registration of FIR thus, is a complaint disclosing commission of a cognizable offence. This aspect has been reiterated and reaffirmed in the case of Khub Chand vs. State of Rajasthan, AIR 1967 SC 1074, Prakash Singh Badal vs. State of Punjab, (2007) 1 SCC (Cri) 193, Ramesh Kumari vs. State (NCT of Delhi), (2006) 1 SCC (Cri.) 678. 
59. Reference may also made to the case of CBI vs. Tapan Kumar Singh, 2003 SCC (Cri) 1305, wherein it was observed that FIR is not an encyclopaedia, which must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported. If the information revealed a cognizable offence is prima facie made out, the FIR has to be necessarily registered. Once an FIR is registered, the police machinery gets activated to conduct the investigations under Section 156 Cr.P.C. The question as to whether the complaint is true whether it discloses the manner of occurrence whether the accused is named and whether there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations are all matters which are alien to the consideration of the question whether the report discloses the commission of a cognizable offence. If these details are not available and are not given in the complaint, the investigating officer is obligated to investigate the facts and ascertain the complete details to ascertain and discover the true facts. Similar observations were made in the Case of Madhu Bala vs. Suresh Kumar, 1998 SCC (Cri) 111.      
60. In Lalita Kumari  (supra), it has been observed that the law must be interpreted to maintain a balance from both the sides: grievance of the victim/informant of non-registration of valid FIRs, as well as that of the accused of being unnecessarily harassed and investigated for charges that are found to be false. The Apex Court after referring to all the aforesaid Judgments,  concluded that there is no ambiguity in regard to the mandatory registration of FIR on receipt of complaint disclosing cognizable offence under Section 154 CrPC. It was observed as under:
44. .A plain reading of Section 154(1) of the Code provides that any information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence if given orally to an officer-in-charge of a police station shall be reduced into writing by him or under his direction. There is no ambiguity in the language of Section 154(1) of the Code.

61. Section 154, therefore, mandates that when a complaint given in writing prima facie discloses a cognizable offence, the Investigating Agency is mandatorily required to register the FIR. 
62. Now coming to the facts of present case, admittedly, the written complaint dated 24.11.2003 was made by the Complainant Mr. N.S. Hoon. There is not a single averment made that the allegations made in the Complaint did not prima facie disclose a cognizable offence. Investigating Agency registered the FIR as required under Section 154 CrPC. Neither any ill intent or  that the defendants were in connivance with the defendant No.4 Shri N.S. Hoon, is either alleged or made out from the record. 
63. The connected question which arises is whether a preliminary enquiry can be conducted before the registration of FIR. This aspect was again considered in detail in the case of Lalita Kumari (Supra). It was observed that since the registration of FIR on disclosure of cognizable offence in a complaint is a mandatory requirement, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius (expression of one thing is the exclusion of other) gets applied to the interpretation of Section 154 and thus, for conducting any investigation, the registration of FIR is the starting point. It was observed that conducting of investigations into an offence after the registration of FIR is the procedure established by law and is thus, in conformity with Article 21 of the Constitution. Thus, the right of an accused under Article 21of Constitution is protected if the FIR is first registered and then the investigations are undertaken. Twin objects are achieved by the registration of FIR, at the earliest; one is that the criminal process is set into motion and is well-documented from the start;  and second the earliest information received in relation to the commission of the offence is recorded so that there can be no embellishment etc. later. 
64. It was explained in the case of Thulia Kali vs. State of Tamilnadu, 1972 SCC (Cri) 543, that on account of the delay, the report not only gets bereft of the advantage or spontaneity, danger creaps  of the introduction of coloured version, exaggerated account or concocted story as a result of deliberation and consultation. 
65.  In the case of Lalita Kumari (supra), it was argued that a Preliminary Enquiry was mandatory in order to avoid the abuse of arbitrary arrest immediately on registration of FIR as it would be contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution. A reference was made to the observations of the Apex Court in Joginder Kumar vs. State of U.P., 1994 SCC (Cri) 1172, wherein it was clarified that a person is not liable to arrest merely on the suspicion of complicity of an offence; there must be some reasonable justification in the opinion of the officer affecting the arrest that such arrest is necessary and justified. Except in heinous offences, arrest must be avoided if the police officer issues Notice to the person to attend the Police Station and not to leave the station, without his permission. It was concluded that it is an imaginary fear that merely because FIR has been registered, it would require arrest of the accused and thereby lead to loss of reputation. The remedy lies in strictly enforcing the safeguards available against the arbitrary arrest made by the police and not in allowing the police to avoid mandatory registration of FIR when the information discloses commission of a cognizable offence. 
66. It was clarified in Lalita Kumari (supra) that even though FIR registration is mandatory, arrest of an accused is not at all mandatory immediately on registration of FIR. The registration of FIR and arrest of a person are two entirely different aspects under the law and there are several safeguards available against the arrest. 
67. In Lalita Kumari (supra), it was thus stated that FIR is the initial point for commencement of investigations and it does not in any way contravene the Constitutional protection under Article 21 of the Constitution. It was thus held that preliminary enquiry before registration of FIR, is not mandated except in certain cases where preliminary enquiry may be required owing to the change in genesis and novelty of crimes with the passage of time. The types of cases in which a preliminary enquiry may be undertaken, were defined as under:-
(a)	Matrimonial disputes/family disputes
(b)	Commercial offences
	(c )	Medical negligence cases
	(d)	Corruption Cases
     (e)	Cases wherein abnormal delay/laches in initiating criminal prosecution without satisfactory explanation of the reasons for delay. It was qualified that such list of category of cases, was not exhaustive of all conditions, which may warrant preliminary enquiry. 
68. Thus, there are specific guidelines which are to be followed by the police before an arrest is made and the Magistrate is also required to ensure that the arrest made is in accordance with law before further detention is authorised.
69. In the present case, considering the complexity of allegations made in the complaint, the I.O. made thorough preliminary inquiries which spread over nine months to find if it prima facie disclosed commission of cognizable offence, before registering the FIR. According to the plaintiffs themselves, they joined the investigations before registration of FIR and handed over the documents as sought by the I.O. Even thereafter, the arrest has been made after two months. 
70. Significantly, on their arrest the Court granted police custody of two days, for effective investigations and thereafter they were sent to judicial custody. In the case of Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273, the Apex Court cautioned that ""before a Magistrate authorises detention under Section 167 CrPC, he has to be first satisfied that the arrest made is legal and in accordance with law and all the constitutional rights of the person arrested are satisfied. If the arrest effected by the police officer does not satisfy the requirements of Section 41 of the Code, Magistrate is duty-bound not to authorise his further detention and release the accused. In other words, when an accused is produced before the Magistrate, the police officer effecting the arrest is required to furnish to the Magistrate, the facts, reasons and its conclusions for arrest and the Magistrate in turn is to be satisfied that the condition precedent for arrest under Section 41 CrPC has been satisfied and it is only thereafter that he will authorise the detention of an accused"".
71. There is no averment made by the plaintiffs that the arrest was made in contradiction of the guidelines enumerated by the Apex Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar (Supra). The arrest could have been termed as motivated and malicious had the arrest been made on the asking of the complainant without any basis, which is not the case. The arrest, therefore, cannot be termed as illegal  since it was for the purpose of interrogation and investigation to establish complicity of the plaintiffs in the alleged acts. 
72. Moreover, the Charge Sheet shows that in support of the allegations made by Shri N.S. Hoon,  during the investigations, documents were seized from the plaintiffs such as Member Client Agreements between the Complainant and the Plaintiffs Company, Individual client registration carrying name, address and signature of Sh. N.S. Hoon, introducers - S/Sh. Girish Aggarwal & Sunil Singhania, Risk Disclosure Documents, Letter dated 29.04.02 which prima facie did disclose commission of the offence. Investigations were required to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations made in the Complaint. Thus, it cannot be said that there was no evidence found by the Investigating Agency for registration of FIR, the veracity of which could have been established only through investigations. Further, on the filing of the Charge Sheet, the Court also did not deem it appropriate to discharge the plaintiffs but they were remanded to police custody for two days and thereafter to judicial custody; thus neither the arrest nor the detention cannot be termed as illegal or malafide.
73. As already noticed above, the plaintiffs were denied bail four times by the Courts, before they were granted Bail by this Court, in which the Investigating Agency had the limited role of only presenting the investigations that were being carried out by them. 
74. A reference to the Order dated 10.11.2004 of the learned M.M. shows that while considering the bail application of the plaintiffs, the Court dismissed the application in view the nature of the offence, which included  forgery, and the amount involved. The relevant part of the Order reads as under:
Arguments heard. The contentions of the Ld. Counsel for the accused are in Lines to the averments contained in the application. Against the Complainant certain material has been shown showing his involvement in other cases also. From the material shows it indeed suggests that the Complainant has been involved in other cases also. Here it may be mentioned that on the first date of hearing when the accused was produced after the arrest the Complaint denied being involved in any litigation whatsoever. Be that as it may. 1 have considered the present bail application as per the material of this case. The contention raised by the Counsel for the accused in detail are also mentioned that the bail application which 1 have perused. However, besides other allegations, the prosecution case is also that accused persons forged certain documents while committing cheating in the present case which is still being investigated. So far as the transaction is concerned, the same is not denied by the accused but on behalf of the accused contentions were raised that the dispute is of evil nature since every penny of the Complainant was accounted for and there was no inducement and no cheating has been committed. It is also submitted that the Complainant is conveniently denying his signatures to make out a case of forgery. I have given thoughtful considerations to the contentions raise on behalf both the sides. We need not go into much detail while, passing the present hail order. Police file which I have perused does show some complicity of the accused persons. The case is still at the stage of investigation.
Keeping in view the nature of the offence including forgery and the amount
involved I am not inclined to accept the hail application of the accused at
this stage. Bail application is rejected.
75. The observations in this Order as well establishes that the complaint required investigations and the acts of Defendants were not motivated by any malice or ulterior design. The Bail applications  were time and again dismissed by the learned MM. The plaintiff may have got the bail after about six months but that in no way, can be attributed to any misconduct of defendants No.1, 2 and 3.
76. The obligation on the State Agency was to complete the investigations in 90 days; since the plaintiffs were in custody, the needful was done by the Police and the Charge Sheet was filed within time, on 29.12.2004.  The due process of law has been followed and no ulterior motive can be attributed to the defendants in either ensuring that the complaint disclosed a prima facie cognizable offence by holding a preliminary inquiry and then registering the FIR.

Whether the defendants	deliberately withheld and suppressed the available Exculpatory evidence while filing the Charge Sheet in the Court:
77. The defendants had during the investigations had sought the Auditors Report in respect of the share transactions and the investments allegedly made by the complainant, to ascertain the truthfulness of the allegations made in the complaint. 
78. The plaintiffs have claimed that the maliciousness of the defendants is evident as the Audit Report exonerating the plaintiffs, had been received in the Police Station on 25.12.2004 and was forwarded to the I.O. on 27.12.2004. However, the Charge Sheet was filed in the Court on 29.12.2004 without placing the Audit Report on record and that it was deliberately suppressed. 
79. A perusal of the Audit Report referred to by the plaintiffs shows that the Auditors verified the relevant Books of accounts, documents, papers pertaining to the above case and provided their conclusions therein. In the Report it was stated that the Complaint made by Shri N.S. Hoon was contradictory and confusing on various points. It was stated that there was neither any Loan Agreement between the accused persons and Mr. N.S. Hoon nor any need of making payment of interest by the accused persons to Mr. N.S. Hoon. The final Analysis arrived at by the Auditors reads as under-
From the aforesaid observations and also relying upon the supporting documents produced to us,we are of the firm opinion that there has been quite heavy share trading by Mr. N.S. Hoon through the accused persons, as a result of which Mr. N.S. Hoon lost quite heavily due to fluctuation in share prices. There has been no such agreement / contract or any other document between Mr. N.S. Hoon and the accused persons given to us to prove that there has been any loan transaction between them. Mr. Hoon was locally contacted on phone on 23/12/2004 to give any other proof of lending money to Gupta Brothers i.e. O.J. Financial Services Ltd. and O.J. Securities Pvt. Ltd. The Phone was attended by Mrs. Meera Ahuja and she informed that Mr. N.S. Hoon is away to Calcutta. After some time Mr. N.S. Hoon phoned back to us from Calcutta and denied having had any such written agreement with O.J. Financial Services Ltd. or O.J. Securities Pvt. Ltd. He denied having had any other document to prove his contention.

80. The above report provided the analysis of the Auditor and gave an opinion that there was heavy share trading between the parties. It  may be observed that the Report did not completely exonerate the plaintiffs of all the charges against them but it only pointed out the contradictions in the complaint made by Shri N.S. Hoon. 
81. Regarding the Audit Report not being filed with the Charge Sheet is concerned, the defendants have explained that the Report was received on 25.12.2004 and marked to the I.O. on 27.12.2004 but the same was not filed as there were further clarifications needed. 
82. Further, it has been contended by the plaintiff that the GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005, which verified the signatures of the complainant and absolved them of the charges of forgery, was only partly filed in the Court on 05.02.2005 and  the complete Report was filed only on 03.03.2005. 
83. In this regard, the defendants have stated that they had received the GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005 only on 01.02.2005 which opined that there was no divergence in the signatures sent for comparison and it leads to the conclusion that the documents were not forged. The defendants in their Written Statement had explained that the same was partially filed deliberately at first, since certain clarifications in the report were needed from the concerned laboratory. Though it is not specified in the Written Statement what the nature of the clarifications were, however, the complete Report was filed on 03.03.2005 i.e. one month after it was received. There might have been a delay by the Investigating Authority; however, the same cannot be termed as malicious. 
84. The Court in its Order dated 20.01.2005 while considering the Bail application, commented  adversely about non-filing of the Audit Report in the next line itself the Court stated that, However, the question which arises is that the fact of not producing the chartered accountant's report and other facts of merits entitles the accused persons to bail or not. The Court then proceeds to determine the question of whether the plaintiffs are entitled to bail based on the Charge Sheet and the materials placed on record, which made out a very grave offence. The final part of the Order reads as under:
I have perused the chargesheet and the material available on record. Even if chartered accountant's report not filing gives rise to suspicion against the prosecution but still in my considered view, the material makes out a very grave offence in the present case. In the present case, the complainant came in contact with both these accused persons through one
Sunil Singhania who is absconding. The accused persons is stated to have induced the Complainant who invested a large
amount promising 1.5% monthly interest in addition to bonds. The Complainant deposited certain cash and shares with the accused. The interest was paid for some time but thereafter was discontinued. The Complainant submits that an amount of Rs. 3.5 crores have been cheated by the accused persons. Similarly, another Complainant R.S. Hoon and Mira Ahuja were cheated of a substantive amount. Even if the chartered accountant's report has not been filed still in my view a very grave offence of large amount of cheating is made out in the present case. It is not that the offences against him paid are only to be considered as grave but even the economic offences are eating out the economy of this country. In my considered view, after giving thoughtful consideration to all the contentions raised in the application and as orally contended no ground for bail of the accused persons is made out keeping in view gravity of the offence. There is no need to discuss further details of evidence in the present bail order. The application for bail is accordingly dismissed. File be put up on the date already fixed. 
85. Thus, it was in view of the gravity of the offence that the bail application of the plaintiffs was dismissed. There might have been a delay by the Investigating Agency in producing the Audit Report or the FSL Report, however, the same cannot be said to be the sole reason for their detention as there was other material as well and delay in filing  the Auditors Report cannot be termed as malicious.
86. As a general rule the Police Officer is bound to lay before the learned M.M., information relevant to establish the commission of criminal offence which has reasonable and probable link to the commission of the offence which leads to arrest, trial and punishment of the offender.
87. Undeniably, it was on the application of the plaintiffs that further investigations were done which ultimately culminated in the filing Cancellation Report by the Investigating Authority. However, the Report  was not only based on the Report of the Accounting Expert dated 25.12.2004 and the GEQD/FSL Report dated 31.01.2005, but they have also relied on the letters sent to the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange to verify the transaction executed by M/s O.J. Securities Pvt. Ltd. in the account of Mr. N.S. Hoon. The reply was received in 2008. Further, clarifications were also sought by the Investigating Authority from Sandeep Ramesh Gupta & Company, Chartered Accountants during the course of Investigation. Thus, from the Cancellation Report it is evident that the Investigating Agency conducted a thorough investigation into the offences alleged against the Plaintiffs and the same cannot be stated to be malicious.
Conclusion
88. In the present case, the plaintiff has not been able to show that there was any malice or any intentional wrong committed by the defendants in following the due process of law in prosecuting the plaintiff.  In fact, they had acted diligently and during the investigations, had sought the FSL Report as well as the Audit Report in order to investigate thoroughly in the complaint made by the complainant Shri N.S. Hoon. The defendants, therefore, took the requisite steps for verification of the signatures of the plaintiff on the various Share Certificates which had been alleged by the complainant to be false and fabricated.  There may have been some delay in being diligent in filing the requisite Reports, but there is no averment that withholding of the Reports was intentional or with any malice.  Even if all the averments of the plaintiff are accepted, then too no malice is disclosed in the acts of the Police/defendants which were done by them in discharge of their official duty.  It cannot be said that the acts of defendants were lacking good faith.  Therefore, no case is made out for grant of damages on account of malicious prosecution against the defendants.
89. The suit is held to be not maintainable and is hereby dismissed.

JUDGMENT    
SURESH KUMAR KAIT, J  
1. The present petition has been filed by the appellant /husband under 
Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955  read with Section 19 of the 
Family Courts Act, 1984 in HMA No . 371/ 17 , against Judgment dated 
25.11.2019 , whereby  his petition under Section 13(1)  (ia) of the HMA, 
1955 , seeking  dissolution of marriage with respondent -wife on the grounds 
of cruelty , was dismissed.  
2. The circumstances , as spelt out in the present appeal, which led the 
appellant to file petition for divorce befo re the learned Family Court , are 
that appellant/ husband  married with the respondent/wife on 10.03.2007  in   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 2 of 16 
 accordance with Hindu R ites and Ceremonies and one son  was born from 
the said wedlock on 08.02.2008 .  
3. According to appellant,  his marriage has been tu multuous since the 
beginning due to the quarrelsome and uncompromising  conduct of the 
respondent  towards him and his family members at every juncture of life. It 
is claimed that the  respondents ‟ non-contribution in household chores , 
threats of suicide and false implication followed by recurring abandonment 
of matrimonial home , has been a chord of contention  and was pleaded as a 
ground s for di ssolution of marriage  in his petition before the learned Family 
Court.   
4. The appellant  has averred  that ever since he moved to  Orissa for his 
training with CISF  on 16.04.2007 , the relationship between the respondent  
and his parents  turned sour d ue to which  the respondent  briefly moved back 
to her maternal home with their new born son , only to return after much 
persuasion . However, due to continued disturbances , the appellant took a 
separate accommodation to live with respondent  in December of 2008 at the 
place of his posting at Jharkhand.  
5. The appellant  claims that despite living separatel y, the responden t‟s 
resistance to household  chores and unruly behavior towards him  persisted . 
Ultimately , he was constrained to send her back to her matrimonial home in 
February,  2009  due to her threat s to tarnish hi s image  at his work place , 
from where the respondent went back to her pare nts house.  
6. The appellant has alleged that the respondent, along with his family 
members, approached his Superior Officer and filed a complaint against 
him, due to which he had to take leave for 20 -25 days to arrange for a 
separate accommodation at the insi stence of respondent.  However, the said    
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 3 of 16 
 accommodation  too was abandoned by the respondent  soon after the 
appellant  left to Jharkhand  to resume his duties .  
7. The appellant has alleged  that on 21.12.2010, at a family gathering  
(Bhandara ceremony for the brot her of the petitioner) , the respondent  got 
into a quarrel with him and made a phone call to her parents. On 
24.12.2010,  her parents came to their  matrimonial home along -with 10 -12 
persons  and  assaulted the appellant and his family members . The appellant 
was constrained to file  a complaint bearing No. 4999051/2016, under 
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C against the respondent and her family members.   
8. The appellant has alleged that respondent -wife thereafter deserted him 
and started living with  her parents. As a counte r blast, the respondent on 
28.02.2011 filed a complaint under Section 498A IPC, which culminated 
into registration of FIR No. 46/2011  at police station  against him and his 
family members wherein allegations of dowry demand and physical abuse 
were raised by  the respondent.  
9. The appellant has averred that in order to save his matrimonial life, he 
preferred a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act , 1955 , on 
03.03.2011 however, the same withdrawn by him on resistance by  
respondent .  
10. Before the learn ed Family Court, respondent -wife in her written 
statement pleaded that she was  constantly tortured  at her matrimonial home 
on account of dowry  demand  and was beaten mercilessly.  She pleaded  that   
their marriage was solemnized with pomp and show and her  father had spent 
a lot of money beyond his capacity  and gave all necessary utensils, articles 
and jewelry  etc. The respondent denie d the allegation that she was reluctant   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 4 of 16 
 to do house hold chores and instead stated that she always performed  her 
social and mat rimonial obligations with responsibility . 
11. The respondent further averr ed that at the time of selection of the  
petitioner  in CISF , appellant‟s father demand Rs. 2,00,000/ - from her father, 
which amount was  given to him  on 14 .05.2007 . However, their behavio r 
towards her did not change and her father -in-law asked her to go to her 
parents house on the assurance that after completion of appellant‟s training, 
she would be brought back to her matrimonial home.  
12. The respondent in her written statement denied the a llegation of 
appellant of having left for her parents house directly from the hospital after 
birth of their son in February, 2008 and pleaded that she had accompanied 
her in -laws to the matrimonial home , where the appellant and his family 
raised further de mands of dowry as gifts of one car and go ld ornaments for 
all their family members in Pilia . However, her family was  unable to fulfil l 
these demands , and so, she was shun ted out from her matr imonial house 
along with her child .  
13. The respondent averred in he r written statement that appellant‟s father 
again demanded Rs. 1,00 ,000/ - from her father at the time of selection of the 
appellant‟s younger brother in Delhi Police and same was given on 
29.04.2009.  
14. The respondent stated that  in an effort to reconcile th e differences, she 
along with her family members  went to Jharkhand on  06.03.2010 where 
appellant  was posted and they met his C ommanding Officer , who assured to 
send him on leave to resolve their conflict s. Thereafter , a panchayat  was 
called by both s ides at her village and it was resolved tha t respondent  would 
accompany her husband to her matrimonial home  but since her mother -in-  
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 5 of 16 
 law refused to live with her, the appellant  arranged a separate 
accommodation in his native village Gangdwa , where he kept the bas ic 
required house hold things but he continued to reside with his parents . 
15. The respondent alleged that appellant‟s family had hosted a Bhandara 
ceremony  on 21.12.2010 after appointment of his younger brother in Delhi 
Police, however, her parents were not i nvited and instead  demand of one car 
and plot was raised from respondent‟s father.  However, since the demand 
were not fulfilled, she was confined and locked in a room and so, on 
24.12.2010 she made a complaint calling police from her brother in law's 
mobil e and also called  her parents . Her father, mother and elder brother 
came to her rescue at around 1.30  PM but they were beaten b y appellant  and 
his family members  with the help of  other persons of the locality. 
Respondent‟s brother made a call on 100 number  and DD R No. 17 A was 
lodged at police station Baba Haridas Nagar. The respondent and her family 
members were taken to hospital and their MLC was conducted.  
16. The respondent pleaded before the learned Family Court  that the 
appellant and his family had commi tted cruelty upon her and she was forced 
to live at her parents ‟ house with the child of the parties and his petition 
seeking divorce on the  grounds of cruelty deserved dismissal.  
17. On the pleading of the parties, the learned Family Court framed the 
followi ng Issues: - 
“i. Whether the petitioner is entitled to divorce on 
the ground of cruelty? (OPP).  
i. Relief .” 
   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 6 of 16 
 18. In order to prove h is case, t he appellant/ husband  exam ined himself as 
PW-1 and the  respondent examined herself as RW -1. Besides, respondent 
also got e xamined her father as RW -2 and her Fufa Ji  as RW -3. 
19. The learned Family Court in the light of testimony of the witnesses 
recorded and other material placed before it, observed that the appellant had 
failed to point out any specific instance against the resp ondent -wife which 
could be termed as cruel treatment on her part and that the allegations 
levelled by the appellant were vague, non -specific and general in nature.  
20. Aggrieved against the impugned judgment dated 25.11.2019  passed 
by the learned Family Court . the appellant has filed the present appeal.  
21. During the course of hearing learned counsel appearing on behalf of 
appellant submitted that the impugned judgment is contrary to the settled 
principles of law and deserves to be set aside. Learned Family Court  has 
failed to appreciate that appellant and his family members were forced to 
fight a false charge of dowry demand for more than six years, in which they 
were acquitted, however, they were forces to suffer ample agony and loss of 
reputation. The Family Co urt erred in holding that appellant could not prove 
that respondent was not willing to do household work and also that 
respondent after discharge from the hospital, had gone to her parental home 
instead of returning to matrimonial home. The respondent and her family 
members had committed physical assault on appellant and the allegations 
levelled by the respondents are based upon oral testimony and no evidence 
in support thereof has been placed on record.  
22. Further submitted that the appellant and his family members have 
been acquitted by the learned Appellate Court of the allegations under   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 7 of 16 
 Section 498A IPC and so, allegations of dowry demand and cruelty at their 
hand are not meted out. Hence, setting aside of impugned judgment is 
sought by the appellant.  
23. To the contrary learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent 
submitted that the judgment passed by the Learned Family Court is well 
merited and no interfer ence is required by  this Court. Hence dismissal of the 
present appeal is sought.  
24. Submissions advan ced by learned counsel representing both the sides 
were heard at length and the testimony of the witnesses, impugned judgment 
and other material placed on record has been perused.  
25. The parties to the present petition got married on 30.03.2007 and on 
08.02.2 008, a child was born out of this wedlock. There is no dispute to the 
position that soon after their marriage, certain differences arose between the 
parties. The appellant has alleged that respondent was reluctant to perform 
household chores and was not wi lling to take responsibility, which is denied 
by the respondent, who claimed to have performed all household chores but 
appellant and his family were not satisfied. On this aspect, learned Family 
Court has held that appellant has not led any evidenc e to su bstantiate his 
allegation.  
26. We find that when the parties enter into a wedlock, their intent is to 
share the responsibilities of future life. In a catena of decisions, it has 
already been held that if a married woman is asked to do household work, 
the same cannot be equated to the work of a maid servant and shall be 
counted as her love and affection for her family . In certain strata , the 
husband takes over the financial obligations and wife accepts house hold   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 8 of 16 
 responsibility. Such is the present case.  Even if  appellant expected the 
respondent to do household chores, it cannot be termed as cruelty.     
27. What is Cruelty has been spelt out in a catena of decisions. T he 
Hon‟ble Supreme Court in Savitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra Pandey  
(2002) 2 SCC 73  has recited “Cru elty” in married life in the following 
words: - 
“6. Cruelty has not been defined under the Act but 
in relation to matrimonial matters it is 
contemplated as a conduct of such type which 
endangers the living of the petitioner with the 
respondent. Cruelty cons ists of acts which are 
dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty for the 
purpose of the Act means where one spouse has so 
treated the other and manifested such feelings 
towards her or him as to have inflicted bodily 
injury, or to have caused reasonable 
apprehension of bodily injury, suffering or to have 
injured health. Cruelty may be physical or mental. 
Mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse 
which causes mental suffering or fear to the 
matrimonial life of the other. “Cruelty”, 
therefore, postulates a treatment of the petitioner 
with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable 
apprehension in his or her mind that it would be 
harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with 
the other party. Cruelty, however, has to be 
distinguished from the ordinary wear  and tear of 
family life.  It cannot be decided on the basis of 
the sensitivity of the petitioner and has to be 
adjudged on the basis of the course of conduct 
which would, in general, be dangerous for a 
spouse to live with the other.”  
   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 9 of 16 
 28. The Hon‟ble Supreme C ourt in Roopa Soni Vs. Kamalnarayan Soni 
2023 SCC OnLine SC 1127 has observed  “the word „cruelty 
under  Section  13(1)(ia)  of the   Act of 1955  has got no fixed meaning, and 
therefore, gives a very wide discretion to the Court to apply it liberally and 
contex tually. What is cruelty  in one case may not be the same for another. 
As stated, it has to be applied from person to person while taking note of the 
attending circumstances.”  The Hon‟ble Supreme Court further held “on the 
question of burden in a petition fo r divorce, burden of proof lies on the 
petitioner. However, the degree of probability is not one beyond reasonable 
doubt, but of preponderance.”  
29. It is the case of both the sides that  while the appellant  was away for 
his dut y, there were discords between re spondent and his family members . 
So, the  respondent most of the time  chose to stay  at her parents‟ house. The 
appellant has alleged that respondent and his family had put a condition to 
live separately from his family. Pursuant to intervention of the Panch ayat 
and appellant‟s Commanding Officer, the appellant took a separate 
accommodation in Gangwda.  
30. In the  case of Narendra Vs. K. Meena  (2016) 9 SCC 455, it has been 
observed by the Supreme Court that asking a son to separate from his family 
amount to cruel ty. It was stated that, for a Hindu son in India, it is not a 
common practise or desirable culture to get separated from his family after 
marriage. A son has a moral and legal obligation to take care of his parents 
when they become old and have negligible or no income.  
31. Even in the present case, the appellant bowed to the desires of 
respondent and arranged for a separate accommodation to save his 
matrimonial life. Even though respondent has alleged that while she lived in   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 10 of 16 
 the said accommodation at Gangwda, the appellant stayed away most of the 
time and so, she was constrained to live with her parents.  
32. Relevantly, the appellant is a member of Force i.e. CISF and he has to 
be away on duty. The respondent on one pretext or the other abandoned her 
matrimonial ho me and lived with her parents. On one hand respondent 
denied to live with her in -laws and over it, she chose to frequently live with 
her parents.  To nurture the matrimonial bond, it is of high significance that 
parties live together and avoid leaving each  other‟s company frequently. 
Temporary separation gives a sense of insecurity in the mind of a spouse 
that the other is not willing to c ontinue the matrimonial bond.  
33. The marital discord between the parties sparked when both the sides 
entered into an alterc ation on 24.12.2010 which resulted into cross 
complaints with the police against the other. On the complaint of appellant 
in respect of alleged incident of 24.12.2010, the Magistrate took cognizance 
under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and summoned the family memb ers of 
respondents under Section 451 and 323 IPC.  
34. Similarly the respondent‟s brother had called PCR on the same day, 
on the basis of which DDR No . 17 A was lodged at police station Baba 
Haridas Nagar , however, outcome of the same has neither been mentione d 
in the impugned judgment nor in the present appeal.  
35. The impugned judgment notes that tr ial in the complaint under 
Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. was at the stage of  defence evidence  when  hearing in 
divorce proceedings was going on. However, in  the present appeal  no 
document has been placed on record to show the outcome of the said 
complaint .   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 11 of 16 
 36. In the impugned judgment, even though learned Family Court has 
observed upon the MLC of respondent‟s family and also that no MLC of 
appellant and his family members was condu cted, yet the final outcome of 
both the cross -complaints has neither been discussed in the judgment nor 
any document has been placed by either side before this Court . 
37. It is relevant  to note here that subsequent to the incident of 
24.12.2010, the respondent  lodged  a complaint against the appellant and his 
family members for dowry demand, which culminated into  registration of 
FIR No. 46/2011, under Sections 498A, 323 & 406 IPC  against them and 
they were  put to trial for the said offences . Even though appellan t was first 
held guilty of the offences in the said FIR, however, in the appeal they were 
acquitted vide judgment dated 04.05.2019,  inter alia  holding as under: - 
“17…..A perusal of testimony of PW11 Umesh 
Devi (complainant) & PW2 Om Parkash (father 
of the complainant) reflect that both the witnesses 
have alleged that the appellants/accused have 
raised illegal demand of dowry and tortured and 
maltreated the complainant and thereafter, turned 
her from her matrimonial house but needless to 
say that no specif ic date and time has been 
mentioned by the complainant when appellants -
accused demanded from him in the shape of Rs.2 
lacs & Rs .1 lac, respectively. Moreover, there is 
no specific time has been mentioned when the 
alleged demand of plot was made by the 
appe llants. Suffice to say, that marriage of 
appellant Parmod was solemnized with the 
complainant in the year 2007 but the case was 
registered in the year 2011 and therefore, it was 
incumbent upon the prosecution to prove 
specifically the time and period when the alleged  
demand was raised by acc used. The complainant   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 12 of 16 
 as well as her father and Umed Singh (PW I) has 
stated that payment of Rs. 1 lac & Rs.2 lacs was 
made to the appellants but again the fact remains 
that no specific documentary evidence has been 
produced on record when the alleged payment of 
aforesaid amount was made to the 
appellants/accused and who received the same . 
Suffice to say, that PW3 Ram Bhagat has stated 
that appellants/accused started demanding plot 
and a vehicle from the complainant but  such 
demand of car when was raised by 
appellants/accused was also not mentioned 
specifically by the complainant. Needless to say, 
that all the witnesses U med Singh (PW 1), Om 
Parkash (PW2), Ram Bhagat (PW3), Rajwanti 
(PW4), Raje nder Panch (PW5) are intere sted and 
related witnesses and several contradictions 
appearing in their testimony regarding the time of 
demand of car and a plot and the allegations of 
torturing the complainant makes them the 
interested witnesses and could not be relied upon. 
In the pres ent case while convicting the appellants 
/accused the learned trial court has held that the 
demand of dowry and misappropriation of dowry 
articles by the appellants have been duly proved 
by the oral testimony of PW1 to PW6 and 
complainant herself as PW 11 but since none of 
the witness has specifically mentioned about the 
time, date and year and even the complainant fails 
to prove the payment of Rs.2 lac and Rs. 1 lac to 
the appellants then merely on the oral testimony  
of the aforesaid witnesses it could not  be held that 
appellants have treated the complainant with 
cruel ty and she was beaten severally to attract  
Section 498A I.P.C. Accordingly, it is held that 
merely on the one instance of scuffle took place on 
24.12.20 I0, the charge under Section 498A LP.C.  
does not prove against the appellants/accused up   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 13 of 16 
 to the hilt in the present case.  
18. Further, the appellant s/accused have 
also charge -sheeted under section 406 I.P.C. In 
the present case but again the fact remains that 
there is no iota  of evidence on m uch prima facie 
on record to prove that to which of the accused 
either husband, father -in-law and mother -in-law 
the istridhan of the complainant was entrusted 
and from whom the demand was made and there 
was a refusal on the part of accused. A perusal of 
the file shows that prosecution has placed on 
record the copy of the alleged dowry articles 
given to the appellants/accused and same were 
received by the complainant vide recovery memo 
(Ex.PW8/A) and thus, in these circumstances, no 
offence under Section 406  I.P.C. was made out.  
 
19. ………..it is apparent that Dr. A.S. Yadav, CM 
.O. at R.T.R.M. Hospital , Jaffarpur, New Delhi 
(PWl3) has proved on record M.L.R. of Om 
Parkash son of Juglal dated 24.12.20 10 
(Ex.PWI3/A), M.L.R. of Dinesh son of Om 
Parkash dated 24 .12.2010 (Ex.PWI3/B), M.L.R. of 
Umesh Devi wife of Pannod dated 24.12.2010 
(Ex.PWI 3/C), M.L.R. of Rajwanti wife of Om 
Parkash dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.PWI3/D). During 
his cross -examination he has also proved the 
M.L.R. of Parmod son of Shiv Narayan dated 24. 
12.2010 (Ex.D 1), M.L.R. of Bharat son of Shiv 
Narayan dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.D2), M.L.R. of 
Savitri Devi dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.D3) and the 
M.L.R. of Shiv Narayan son of Mathura dated 
24.10.2010 (Ex.D4) and thus, it can be safely 
concluded that the appellant's  family and family 
of complainant were not having cordial relation 
to each other and both the parties had a fight with 
each other. However, as regard to the allegations 
under Section 323 I.P.C. is concerned it is held   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 14 of 16 
 that aforesaid incident had took place  at 
Najafgarh, Delhi on 24.12.2010 and not at 
Jhajjar and thereafter, the F.I.R. was lodged in 
this case on 28.02.20 II and thus, the alleged 
incident took place much prior to the registration 
of F. I.R. and this, Section 323 I.P.C. is not 
attracted in the present case as alleged.  
21. In view of my aforesaid discussions and 
observations, it is held that prosecution has 
miserably failed to bring home the guilt of 
appellants/accused for the commission of offence 
under Section 498A, 406 & 323 of I.P.C. in the 
present case and thus, the judgment of conviction 
dated 07.06.2017 and order of sentence dated 
08.06.2017 passed by the learned trial court is not 
sustainable in the eyes of law and thus, liable to 
be set aside. Hence, appellants/accused, named 
Parmod, Shiv  Narayan and Savini were acquitted 
of the charges levelled against them. Accordingly, 
the judgment of conviction dated 07.06.2017 and 
order of sentence dated 08.06.2017 passed by the 
learned trial court is hereby set aside. The appeal 
filed by the appellan ts/accused stands allowed. 
Lower court record be sent back along with the 
copy of judgment. Appeal file be consigned to the 
record room after due compliance.”  
 
38.  Every aggrieved person has an absolute right to initiate appropriate 
legal action and approach the State machinery, however, such allegations 
have to be supported by cogent evidence. Though filing of a criminal 
complaint per-se does not amount to cruelty, however, grave and 
uncorroborated allegations amounts to cruelty.  
39. The Supreme Court in the cas e of Ravi Kumar Vs. Julmidevi  (2010) 
4 SCC 476 has categorically held that “reckless, false and defamatory 
allegations against the husband and family members would have an effect of   
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 15 of 16 
 lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society”  and it amounts to 
„cruelty‟. Similar observations were made by the Coordinate Bench of this 
Court in the case of Rita Vs. Jai Solanki  (2017) SCC OnLine Del 907. 45. 
Further, in the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita  (2014) SLT 126 the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false complaint against the 
husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the 
purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act.  
40. It is also worthy note here that parties to the present appeal have been 
living separately sinc e August, 2010. During pendency of afore -noted FIR 
proceedings, the appellant had also filed an application under Section 9 of 
the Act on 03.03.2011 seeking Restitution of Conjugal Rights, which was 
withdrawn by him. However, respondent did not file any su ch application to 
join company of her husband.  
41. It has already been held that instances of cruelty are not to be taken in 
isolation but cumulative effect of facts and circumstances emerging from 
evidence on record and then drawing a fair inference whether a spouse  has 
been subjected to mental cruelty due to conduct of other spouse has to be 
culled out.  
42. The facts of the present case clearly demonstrate that soon after their 
marriage, parties had marital conflicts. The respondent -wife had no intention 
to live  in joint family and to make herself comfortable, left her matrimonial 
home very frequently to live with h er parents. The appellant on the other 
hand by arranging separate accommodation tried his best to keep her happy, 
however, by choosing to stay with he r parents, she has not only ignored her 
matrimonial obligations but also deprived the appellant of his fatherhood by 
keeping him away from his son.     
  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 63/2021                                                                                                            Page 16 of 16 
 43. In the light of aforesaid, this Court is of the considered opinion that 
appellant has been subjected to cr uelty at the hands of respondent -wife. The 
impugned judgment dated 25.11.2019  is hereby set aside and appellant is 
granted divorce  under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  
44. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly.  
45. With directions, as aforesaid , the present appeal and pending 
application, if any, are accordingly disposed of.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT
     HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA

     JUDGMENT  
SURESH KUMAR KAIT, J
1. The present petition has been filed by the appellant/husband under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 read with Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 in HMA No. 371/ 17, against Judgment dated 25.11.2019, whereby his petition under Section 13(1) (ia) of the HMA, 1955, seeking dissolution of marriage with respondent-wife on the grounds of cruelty, was dismissed.
2. The circumstances, as spelt out in the present appeal, which led the appellant to file petition for divorce before the learned Family Court, are that appellant/husband married with the respondent/wife on 10.03.2007 in accordance with Hindu Rites and Ceremonies and one son was born from the said wedlock on 08.02.2008. 
3. According to appellant, his marriage has been tumultuous since the beginning due to the quarrelsome and uncompromising conduct of the respondent towards him and his family members at every juncture of life. It is claimed that the respondents non-contribution in household chores, threats of suicide and false implication followed by recurring abandonment of matrimonial home, has been a chord of contention and was pleaded as a grounds for dissolution of marriage in his petition before the learned Family Court. 
4. The appellant has averred that ever since he moved to Orissa for his training with CISF on 16.04.2007, the relationship between the respondent and his parents turned sour due to which the respondent briefly moved back to her maternal home with their new born son, only to return after much persuasion. However, due to continued disturbances, the appellant took a separate accommodation to live with respondent in December of 2008 at the place of his posting at Jharkhand. 
5. The appellant claims that despite living separately, the respondents resistance to household chores and unruly behavior towards him persisted. Ultimately, he was constrained to send her back to her matrimonial home in February, 2009 due to her threats to tarnish his image at his work place, from where the respondent went back to her parents house.
6. The appellant has alleged that the respondent, along with his family members, approached his Superior Officer and filed a complaint against him, due to which he had to take leave for 20-25 days to arrange for a separate accommodation at the insistence of respondent.  However, the said accommodation too was abandoned by the respondent soon after the appellant left to Jharkhand to resume his duties. 
7. The appellant has alleged that on 21.12.2010, at a family gathering (Bhandara ceremony for the brother of the petitioner), the respondent got into a quarrel with him and made a phone call to her parents. On 24.12.2010, her parents came to their matrimonial home along-with 10-12 persons and  assaulted the appellant and his family members. The appellant was constrained to file a complaint bearing No. 4999051/2016, under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C against the respondent and her family members. 
8. The appellant has alleged that respondent-wife thereafter deserted him and started living with her parents. As a counter blast, the respondent on 28.02.2011 filed a complaint under Section 498A IPC, which culminated into registration of FIR No. 46/2011 at police station against him and his family members wherein allegations of dowry demand and physical abuse were raised by the respondent. 
9. The appellant has averred that in order to save his matrimonial life, he preferred a petition under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, on 03.03.2011 however, the same withdrawn by him on resistance by respondent. 
10. Before the learned Family Court, respondent-wife in her written statement pleaded that she was constantly tortured at her matrimonial home on account of dowry demand and was beaten mercilessly. She pleaded that   their marriage was solemnized with pomp and show and her father had spent a lot of money beyond his capacity and gave all necessary utensils, articles and jewelry etc. The respondent denied the allegation that she was reluctant to do house hold chores and instead stated that she always performed her social and matrimonial obligations with responsibility.
11. The respondent further averred that at the time of selection of the petitioner in CISF, appellants father demand Rs. 2,00,000/- from her father, which amount was  given to him on 14.05.2007. However, their behavior towards her did not change and her father-in-law asked her to go to her parents house on the assurance that after completion of appellants training, she would be brought back to her matrimonial home. 
12. The respondent in her written statement denied the allegation of appellant of having left for her parents house directly from the hospital after birth of their son in February, 2008 and pleaded that she had accompanied her in-laws to the matrimonial home, where the appellant and his family raised further demands of dowry as gifts of one car and gold ornaments for all their family members in Pilia. However, her family was unable to fulfill these demands, and so, she was shunted out from her matrimonial house along with her child. 
13. The respondent averred in her written statement that appellants father again demanded Rs. 1,00,000/- from her father at the time of selection of the appellants younger brother in Delhi Police and same was given on 29.04.2009. 
14. The respondent stated that in an effort to reconcile the differences, she along with her family members went to Jharkhand on 06.03.2010 where appellant was posted and they met his Commanding Officer, who assured to send him on leave to resolve their conflicts. Thereafter, a panchayat was called by both sides at her village and it was resolved that respondent would accompany her husband to her matrimonial home but since her mother-in-law refused to live with her, the appellant arranged a separate accommodation in his native village Gangdwa, where he kept the basic required house hold things but he continued to reside with his parents.
15. The respondent alleged that appellants family had hosted a Bhandara ceremony on 21.12.2010 after appointment of his younger brother in Delhi Police, however, her parents were not invited and instead demand of one car and plot was raised from respondents father. However, since the demand were not fulfilled, she was confined and locked in a room and so, on 24.12.2010 she made a complaint calling police from her brother in law's mobile and also called her parents. Her father, mother and elder brother came to her rescue at around 1.30 PM but they were beaten by appellant and his family members with the help of other persons of the locality. Respondents brother made a call on 100 number and DDR No. 17 A was lodged at police station Baba Haridas Nagar. The respondent and her family members were taken to hospital and their MLC was conducted. 
16. The respondent pleaded before the learned Family Court that the appellant and his family had committed cruelty upon her and she was forced to live at her parents house with the child of the parties and his petition seeking divorce on the  grounds of cruelty deserved dismissal.
17. On the pleading of the parties, the learned Family Court framed the following Issues:-
i.	Whether the petitioner is entitled to divorce on the ground of cruelty? (OPP).

18. In order to prove his case, the appellant/ husband examined himself as PW-1 and the respondent examined herself as RW-1. Besides, respondent also got examined her father as RW-2 and her Fufa Ji as RW-3.
19. The learned Family Court in the light of testimony of the witnesses recorded and other material placed before it, observed that the appellant had failed to point out any specific instance against the respondent-wife which could be termed as cruel treatment on her part and that the allegations levelled by the appellant were vague, non-specific and general in nature. 
20. Aggrieved against the impugned judgment dated 25.11.2019 passed by the learned Family Court. the appellant has filed the present appeal.
21. During the course of hearing learned counsel appearing on behalf of appellant submitted that the impugned judgment is contrary to the settled principles of law and deserves to be set aside. Learned Family Court has failed to appreciate that appellant and his family members were forced to fight a false charge of dowry demand for more than six years, in which they were acquitted, however, they were forces to suffer ample agony and loss of reputation. The Family Court erred in holding that appellant could not prove that respondent was not willing to do household work and also that respondent after discharge from the hospital, had gone to her parental home instead of returning to matrimonial home. The respondent and her family members had committed physical assault on appellant and the allegations levelled by the respondents are based upon oral testimony and no evidence in support thereof has been placed on record. 
22. Further submitted that the appellant and his family members have been acquitted by the learned Appellate Court of the allegations under Section 498A IPC and so, allegations of dowry demand and cruelty at their hand are not meted out. Hence, setting aside of impugned judgment is sought by the appellant. 
23. To the contrary learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent submitted that the judgment passed by the Learned Family Court is well merited and no interference is required by this Court. Hence dismissal of the present appeal is sought. 
24. Submissions advanced by learned counsel representing both the sides were heard at length and the testimony of the witnesses, impugned judgment and other material placed on record has been perused.
25. The parties to the present petition got married on 30.03.2007 and on 08.02.2008, a child was born out of this wedlock. There is no dispute to the position that soon after their marriage, certain differences arose between the parties. The appellant has alleged that respondent was reluctant to perform household chores and was not willing to take responsibility, which is denied by the respondent, who claimed to have performed all household chores but appellant and his family were not satisfied. On this aspect, learned Family Court has held that appellant has not led any evidence to substantiate his allegation.
26. We find that when the parties enter into a wedlock, their intent is to share the responsibilities of future life. In a catena of decisions, it has already been held that if a married woman is asked to do household work, the same cannot be equated to the work of a maid servant and shall be counted as her love and affection for her family. In certain strata, the husband takes over the financial obligations and wife accepts house hold responsibility. Such is the present case. Even if appellant expected the respondent to do household chores, it cannot be termed as cruelty.    
27. What is Cruelty has been spelt out in a catena of decisions. The Honble Supreme Court in Savitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra Pandey (2002) 2 SCC 73 has recited Cruelty in married life in the following words:-
6. Cruelty has not been defined under the Act but in relation to matrimonial matters it is contemplated as a conduct of such type which endangers the living of the petitioner with the respondent. Cruelty consists of acts which are dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty for the purpose of the Act means where one spouse has so treated the other and manifested such feelings towards her or him as to have inflicted bodily injury, or to have caused reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, suffering or to have injured health. Cruelty may be physical or mental. Mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse which causes mental suffering or fear to the matrimonial life of the other. Cruelty, therefore, postulates a treatment of the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party. Cruelty, however, has to be distinguished from the ordinary wear and tear of family life. It cannot be decided on the basis of the sensitivity of the petitioner and has to be adjudged on the basis of the course of conduct which would, in general, be dangerous for a spouse to live with the other.

28. The Honble Supreme Court in Roopa Soni Vs. Kamalnarayan Soni 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1127 has observed the word cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of the  Act of 1955 has got no fixed meaning, and therefore, gives a very wide discretion to the Court to apply it liberally and contextually. What is cruelty in one case may not be the same for another. As stated, it has to be applied from person to person while taking note of the attending circumstances. The Honble Supreme Court further held on the question of burden in a petition for divorce, burden of proof lies on the petitioner. However, the degree of probability is not one beyond reasonable doubt, but of preponderance.
29. It is the case of both the sides that while the appellant was away for his duty, there were discords between respondent and his family members. So, the respondent most of the time chose to stay at her parents house. The appellant has alleged that respondent and his family had put a condition to live separately from his family. Pursuant to intervention of the Panchayat and appellants Commanding Officer, the appellant took a separate accommodation in Gangwda. 
30. In the case of Narendra Vs. K. Meena (2016) 9 SCC 455, it has been observed by the Supreme Court that asking a son to separate from his family amount to cruelty. It was stated that, for a Hindu son in India, it is not a common practise or desirable culture to get separated from his family after marriage. A son has a moral and legal obligation to take care of his parents when they become old and have negligible or no income. 
31. Even in the present case, the appellant bowed to the desires of respondent and arranged for a separate accommodation to save his matrimonial life. Even though respondent has alleged that while she lived in the said accommodation at Gangwda, the appellant stayed away most of the time and so, she was constrained to live with her parents.
32. Relevantly, the appellant is a member of Force i.e. CISF and he has to be away on duty. The respondent on one pretext or the other abandoned her matrimonial home and lived with her parents. On one hand respondent denied to live with her in-laws and over it, she chose to frequently live with her parents.  To nurture the matrimonial bond, it is of high significance that parties live together and avoid leaving each others company frequently. Temporary separation gives a sense of insecurity in the mind of a spouse that the other is not willing to continue the matrimonial bond.
33. The marital discord between the parties sparked when both the sides entered into an altercation on 24.12.2010 which resulted into cross complaints with the police against the other. On the complaint of appellant in respect of alleged incident of 24.12.2010, the Magistrate took cognizance under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and summoned the family members of respondents under Section 451 and 323 IPC. 
34. Similarly the respondents brother had called PCR on the same day, on the basis of which DDR No. 17 A was lodged at police station Baba Haridas Nagar, however, outcome of the same has neither been mentioned in the impugned judgment nor in the present appeal.
35. The impugned judgment notes that trial in the complaint under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. was at the stage of defence evidence when hearing in divorce proceedings was going on. However, in the present appeal no document has been placed on record to show the outcome of the said complaint.
36. In the impugned judgment, even though learned Family Court has observed upon the MLC of respondents family and also that no MLC of appellant and his family members was conducted, yet the final outcome of both the cross-complaints has neither been discussed in the judgment nor any document has been placed by either side before this Court.
37. It is relevant to note here that subsequent to the incident of 24.12.2010, the respondent lodged a complaint against the appellant and his family members for dowry demand, which culminated into registration of FIR No. 46/2011, under Sections 498A, 323 & 406 IPC against them and they were put to trial for the said offences. Even though appellant was first held guilty of the offences in the said FIR, however, in the appeal they were acquitted vide judgment dated 04.05.2019,  inter alia  holding as under:-
17..A perusal of testimony of PW11 Umesh Devi (complainant) & PW2 Om Parkash (father of the complainant) reflect that both the witnesses have alleged that the appellants/accused have raised illegal demand of dowry and tortured and maltreated the complainant and thereafter, turned her from her matrimonial house but needless to say that no specific date and time has been mentioned by the complainant when appellants-accused demanded from him in the shape of Rs.2 lacs & Rs.1 lac, respectively. Moreover, there is no specific time has been mentioned when the alleged demand of plot was made by the appellants. Suffice to say, that marriage of appellant Parmod was solemnized with the complainant in the year 2007 but the case was registered in the year 2011 and therefore, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove specifically the time and period when the alleged demand was raised by acc used. The complainant as well as her father and Umed Singh (PW I) has stated that payment of Rs. 1 lac & Rs.2 lacs was made to the appellants but again the fact remains that no specific documentary evidence has been produced on record when the alleged payment of aforesaid amount was made to the appellants/accused and who received the same . Suffice to say, that PW3 Ram Bhagat has stated that appellants/accused started demanding plot and a vehicle from the complainant but such demand of car when was raised by appellants/accused was also not mentioned specifically by the complainant. Needless to say, that all the witnesses Umed Singh (PW 1), Om Parkash (PW2), Ram Bhagat (PW3), Rajwanti (PW4), Rajender Panch (PW5) are interested and related witnesses and several contradictions appearing in their testimony regarding the time of demand of car and a plot and the allegations of torturing the complainant makes them the interested witnesses and could not be relied upon. In the present case while convicting the appellants /accused the learned trial court has held that the demand of dowry and misappropriation of dowry articles by the appellants have been duly proved by the oral testimony of PW1 to PW6 and complainant herself as PW 11 but since none of the witness has specifically mentioned about the time, date and year and even the complainant fails to prove the payment of Rs.2 lac and Rs. 1 lac to the appellants then merely on the oral testimony of the aforesaid witnesses it could not be held that appellants have treated the complainant with cruelty and she was beaten severally to attract Section 498A I.P.C. Accordingly, it is held that merely on the one instance of scuffle took place on 24.12.20 I0, the charge under Section 498A LP.C. does not prove against the appellants/accused up to the hilt in the present case. 
18.	Further, the appellant s/accused have also charge-sheeted under section 406 I.P.C. In the present case but again the fact remains that there is no iota of evidence on much prima facie on record to prove that to which of the accused either husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law the istridhan of the complainant was entrusted and from whom the demand was made and there was a refusal on the part of accused. A perusal of the file shows that prosecution has placed on record the copy of the alleged dowry articles given to the appellants/accused and same were received by the complainant vide recovery memo (Ex.PW8/A) and thus, in these circumstances, no offence under Section 406 I.P.C. was made out.

19. ..it is apparent that Dr. A.S. Yadav, CM .O. at R.T.R.M. Hospital , Jaffarpur, New Delhi (PWl3) has proved on record M.L.R. of Om Parkash son of Juglal dated 24.12.20 10 (Ex.PWI3/A), M.L.R. of Dinesh son of Om Parkash dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.PWI3/B), M.L.R. of Umesh Devi wife of Pannod dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.PWI 3/C), M.L.R. of Rajwanti wife of Om Parkash dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.PWI3/D). During his cross-examination he has also proved the M.L.R. of Parmod son of Shiv Narayan dated 24. 12.2010 (Ex.D1), M.L.R. of Bharat son of Shiv Narayan dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.D2), M.L.R. of Savitri Devi dated 24.12.2010 (Ex.D3) and the M.L.R. of Shiv Narayan son of Mathura dated 24.10.2010 (Ex.D4) and thus, it can be safely concluded that the appellant's family and family of complainant were not having cordial relation to each other and both the parties had a fight with each other. However, as regard to the allegations under Section 323 I.P.C. is concerned it is held that aforesaid incident had took place at Najafgarh, Delhi on 24.12.2010 and not at Jhajjar and thereafter, the F.I.R. was lodged in this case on 28.02.20 II and thus, the alleged incident took place much prior to the registration of F.I.R. and this, Section 323 I.P.C. is not attracted in the present case as alleged.
21.	In view of my aforesaid discussions and observations, it is held that prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt of appellants/accused for the commission of offence under Section 498A, 406 & 323 of I.P.C. in the present case and thus, the judgment of conviction dated 07.06.2017 and order of sentence dated 08.06.2017 passed by the learned trial court is not sustainable in the eyes of law and thus, liable to be set aside. Hence, appellants/accused, named Parmod, Shiv Narayan and Savini were acquitted of the charges levelled against them. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction dated 07.06.2017 and order of sentence dated 08.06.2017 passed by the learned trial court is hereby set aside. The appeal filed by the appellants/accused stands allowed. Lower court record be sent back along with the copy of judgment. Appeal file be consigned to the record room after due compliance.

38.  Every aggrieved person has an absolute right to initiate appropriate legal action and approach the State machinery, however, such allegations have to be supported by cogent evidence. Though filing of a criminal complaint per-se does not amount to cruelty, however, grave and uncorroborated allegations amounts to cruelty. 
39. The Supreme Court in the case of Ravi Kumar Vs. Julmidevi (2010) 4 SCC 476 has categorically held that reckless, false and defamatory allegations against the husband and family members would have an effect of lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society and it amounts to cruelty. Similar observations were made by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Rita Vs. Jai Solanki (2017) SCC OnLine Del 907. 45. Further, in the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita (2014) SLT 126 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false complaint against the husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act.
40. It is also worthy note here that parties to the present appeal have been living separately since August, 2010. During pendency of afore-noted FIR proceedings, the appellant had also filed an application under Section 9 of the Act on 03.03.2011 seeking Restitution of Conjugal Rights, which was withdrawn by him. However, respondent did not file any such application to join company of her husband. 
41. It has already been held that instances of cruelty are not to be taken in isolation but cumulative effect of facts and circumstances emerging from evidence on record and then drawing a fair inference whether a spouse has been subjected to mental cruelty due to conduct of other spouse has to be culled out.
42. The facts of the present case clearly demonstrate that soon after their marriage, parties had marital conflicts. The respondent-wife had no intention to live in joint family and to make herself comfortable, left her matrimonial home very frequently to live with her parents. The appellant on the other hand by arranging separate accommodation tried his best to keep her happy, however, by choosing to stay with her parents, she has not only ignored her matrimonial obligations but also deprived the appellant of his fatherhood by keeping him away from his son.  
43. In the light of aforesaid, this Court is of the considered opinion that appellant has been subjected to cruelty at the hands of respondent-wife. The impugned judgment dated 25.11.2019 is hereby set aside and appellant is granted divorce under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
44. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly.
45. With directions, as aforesaid, the present appeal and pending application, if any, are accordingly disposed of.

 DELHI HIGH COURT     ..... Respondent  
    Through:  Mr Shashank Garg, Adv.  
 
 CORAM:  
 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER  
 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL  
[Physical Court Hearing/Hybrid Hearing (as per request )] 
RAJIV SHAKDHER, J.   (ORAL):  
1. On the previous date, i.e., 02.02.2024, when the matter was heard, we 
had, broadly, recorded the contours of the case. For convenience, the relevant 
part of the said order is extracted hereafter:  
“2. The principal grievance raised by the petitioner is that be cause minimum 
marks were fixed for the interview [concerning recruitment for the post of Junior 
Judicial Assistant/Restorer], he was disqualified.   
3. It is averred that in the main written examination, the petitioner secured 
69.5 marks and in the intervi ew, he obtained 10 marks.   
4. As per the notification issued by the respondent/Delhi High Court [in 
short, “DHC”], the petitioner had to secure in the interview a minimum of 11 
out of 25 marks.   
5. The petitioner claims that if the marks obtained in the written 
examination and the interview are added up his rank would scale up to second 
place, albeit in the category of „EWS candidates‟.  
6. To be noted, the number of posts advertised under the EWS category was  
W.P.(C) 1554/2024                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 5 
 
21.   
7. Mr Shashank Garg, learned counsel, wh o appears on behalf of the DHC, 
says that for the future, the course correction has been made inasmuch, the 
previous regime requiring prescription of minimum qualifying marks for 
interviews for Group B and C posts has been discarded.   
8. Mr Garg submits t hat this course of action was taken pursuant to the 
intercession of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.6353/2023, titled, Aalma 
Vs. Delhi High Court .   
9. Prima facie, according to us, although the grievance articulated by the 
petitioner has weight, it i s the juncture at which he has decided to approach the 
court that ties our hands.  
10.   However, we would like Mr Garg to place the relevant data before us which 
would disclose the details of candidates who failed to get appointed because they 
did not meet  the erstwhile criteria put in place of securing minimum qualifying 
marks fixed for interview qua the subject examination i.e., JJA/Restorer (Group 
'C') Examination, 2020.  
11. At this stage, we are told by Mr Garg, on instructions, that all 21 posts in 
the EWS category stand filled up.  
12. List the matter on 01.03.2024.”  
 
2. Mr Shashank Garg, learned counsel, who appears on behalf of the 
respondent/Delhi High Court, has placed before us the data which has brought 
to the fore as to how an increase in the int erview marks would impact the 
candidates falling in reserved category. The relevant part of that data is set forth 
hereafter:  
“Reserved Categories (EWS, OBC, SC, ST, Ex. Servicemen, PwD)  
*Maximum marks in Interview – 25 
*Minimum passing marks for reserved categories – 11 
Failed by marks  Total number of candidates  
1 mark  158 
2 marks  40 
3 marks  60 
5 marks  1 
Total  259 
  
W.P.(C) 1554/2024                                                                                                                             Page 3 of 5 
 
3. As would be evident, if one (01) mark is  increased in the reserved 
categories , comprising EWS, OBC, SC, ST, Ex. Servicemen, and PwD, 158 
candidates will get impacted.  
4. It is not in dispute that under the regime prevalent at the time when 
examinations were held for Junior Judicial Assistant (JJA)/Restorer Group ‘C’ 
Examination, 20 20, the candidates were required to obtain a minimum of 11 
marks out of a total of 25 marks allocated for the interview.  
4.1 Concededly, the petitioner obtained only 10 marks and hence failed to 
qualify.  
5. Mr B.S. Chauhan, l earned counsel ,who appears on  behalf of  the 
petitioner , says that fixing minimum marks for interview has been deprecated 
in the judgment dated 05.12.2023, rendered by the Supreme Court in Civil 
Appeal No.6353/2023, titled Aalma v. Delhi High Court.  
6. As indicated on the previous date , i.e., 02.02.2024, the respondent/ Delhi 
High Court has already taken corrective measures, albeit  for the future and, 
accordingly, in exercise of powers under Article 229 of the Constitution, issued 
the following notification dated 18.11.2023:  
 
“No.113/El -4/Estt. -I/DHC  
Date: 18.11.2023  
NOTIFICATION  
 
In exercise of the powers vested under Article 229 of the Constitution of 
India, Hon‟ble the Chief Justice of this Court has been pleased to amend the note 
at the end of Schedule -II(A) and II(B) to Delhi High Court Establishment 
(Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1972 as under:  
“*** Viva -voce/interview marks shall not be more than 15% of the  
W.P.(C) 1554/2024                                                                                                                             Page 4 of 5 
 
total marks of the written examination while making appointment 
through departmental examination as well as di rect recruitment.”  
 
**there will be no minimum qualifying marks in the interview”  
 
Note:  the above amendment shall be applicable in the cadres of Group „C‟, 
Group „B‟ (non -Gazetted), Group „B‟ (Gazetted), Group „A‟ posts both in direct 
recruitment as well as departmental examinations. This shall come into force 
with immediate effect.”  
[Emphasis is ours]  
 
7. As would be evident on a perusal of the notification  extracted 
hereinabove , under  the extant regime governing interviews for Group ‘C’, 
Group ‘B’ (non -Gazetted), Group ‘B’ (Gazetted) and Group ‘A’ posts,  while 
making appointments  through  both departmental examination as well as direct 
recruitment, the viva-voce/interview marks would not exceed 15% of the total 
marks allocated to the written examination.  
8. Furthermore, the rules have been amended to reflect that now there will 
be no minimum qualifying marks stipulated for the interview.  
9. Unfortunately for the petitioner, the course correction came after the 
examination, followed by the interview, was held. The written examination was 
held on 19.09.2021 while the interviews for the subject post were held between 
24.06.2022 to 03.07.2022. The record shows that the final list of successful 
candidates was published on 26.08.2022. The notific ation doing away with 
minimum marks for interview was issued on 18.11.2023.  
10. In our view, t he petitioner, after having taken the exam, cannot assail the 
procedure and rules after he  was declared unsuccessful. The cause articulated in 
the writ petition h as, however, received the attention of the court and, as  
W.P.(C) 1554/2024                                                                                                                             Page 5 of 5 
 
noticed above, necessary course correction has been made.  
11. It is the contention of Mr Chauhan  that in Aalma ‟scase, the concerned 
candidate was appointed pursuant to an interim order passed by the  Supreme 
Court, on 26.09.2023.  
11.1 The interim direction, as would be evident, was made final  by a 
subsequent order rendered by the Supreme Court on 05.12.2023, in exercise of 
powers under Article 136 read with Article 142 of the Constitution.  
12. The pe titioner cannot claim parity with the decision  rendered  in Aalma ‟s 
case. As observed above, insofar as respondent/ Delhi High Court is concerned, 
the aforesaid aspect was brought to its notice and remedial measures were 
taken . 
13. Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we are not inclined to entertain the writ 
petition.  
14. The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.  
15. Parties will act based on the digitally signed copy of the judgment.

	HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SHAKDHER
	HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL
[Physical Court Hearing/Hybrid Hearing (as per request)]
    RAJIV SHAKDHER, J.  (ORAL):
1.	On the previous date, i.e., 02.02.2024, when the matter was heard, we had, broadly, recorded the contours of the case. For convenience, the relevant part of the said order is extracted hereafter:
2.	The principal grievance raised by the petitioner is that because minimum marks were fixed for the interview [concerning recruitment for the post of Junior Judicial Assistant/Restorer], he was disqualified.  
3.	It is averred that in the main written examination, the petitioner secured 69.5 marks and in the interview, he obtained 10 marks.  
4.	As per the notification issued by the respondent/Delhi High Court [in short, DHC], the petitioner had to secure in the interview a minimum of 11 out of 25 marks.  
5.	The petitioner claims that if the marks obtained in the written examination and the interview are added up his rank would scale up to second place, albeit in the category of EWS candidates.
6.	To be noted, the number of posts advertised under the EWS category was 21.  
7.	Mr Shashank Garg, learned counsel, who appears on behalf of the DHC, says that for the future, the course correction has been made inasmuch, the previous regime requiring prescription of minimum qualifying marks for interviews for Group B and C posts has been discarded.  
8.	Mr Garg submits that this course of action was taken pursuant to the intercession of the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.6353/2023, titled, Aalma Vs. Delhi High Court.  
9.	Prima facie, according to us, although the grievance articulated by the petitioner has weight, it is the juncture at which he has decided to approach the court that ties our hands.
10.   However, we would like Mr Garg to place the relevant data before us which would disclose the details of candidates who failed to get appointed because they did not meet the erstwhile criteria put in place of securing minimum qualifying marks fixed for interview qua the subject examination i.e., JJA/Restorer (Group 'C') Examination, 2020.
11.	At this stage, we are told by Mr Garg, on instructions, that all 21 posts in the EWS category stand filled up.
12.	List the matter on 01.03.2024.

2.	Mr Shashank Garg, learned counsel, who appears on behalf of the respondent/Delhi High Court, has placed before us the data which has brought to the fore as to how an increase in the interview marks would impact the candidates falling in reserved category. The relevant part of that data is set forth hereafter:
Reserved Categories (EWS, OBC, SC, ST, Ex. Servicemen, PwD)
*Maximum marks in Interview  25
*Minimum passing marks for reserved categories  11
Failed by marks
Total number of candidates
1 mark
158
2 marks
40
3 marks
60
5 marks
1
Total
259

3.	As would be evident, if one (01) mark is increased in the reserved categories, comprising EWS, OBC, SC, ST, Ex. Servicemen, and PwD, 158 candidates will get impacted. 
4.	It is not in dispute that under the regime prevalent at the time when examinations were held for Junior Judicial Assistant (JJA)/Restorer Group C Examination, 2020, the candidates were required to obtain a minimum of 11 marks out of a total of 25 marks allocated for the interview. 
4.1	Concededly, the petitioner obtained only 10 marks and hence failed to qualify. 
5.	Mr B.S. Chauhan, learned counsel,who appears on behalf of the petitioner, says that fixing minimum marks for interview has been deprecated in the judgment dated 05.12.2023, rendered by the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.6353/2023, titled Aalma v. Delhi High Court.
6.	As indicated on the previous date, i.e., 02.02.2024, the respondent/Delhi High Court has already taken corrective measures, albeit for the future and, accordingly, in exercise of powers under Article 229 of the Constitution, issued the following notification dated 18.11.2023:

No.113/El-4/Estt.-I/DHC
Date: 18.11.2023
NOTIFICATION

      In exercise of the powers vested under Article 229 of the Constitution of India, Honble the Chief Justice of this Court has been pleased to amend the note at the end of Schedule-II(A) and II(B) to Delhi High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1972 as under:
***Viva-voce/interview marks shall not be more than 15% of the total marks of the written examination while making appointment through departmental examination as well as direct recruitment.

**there will be no minimum qualifying marks in the interview

Note:	the above amendment shall be applicable in the cadres of Group C, Group B (non-Gazetted), Group B (Gazetted), Group A posts both in direct recruitment as well as departmental examinations. This shall come into force with immediate effect.
[Emphasis is ours]

7.	As would be evident on a perusal of the notification extracted hereinabove, under the extant regime governing interviews for Group C, Group B (non-Gazetted), Group B (Gazetted) and Group A posts, while making appointments through both departmental examination as well as direct recruitment,the viva-voce/interview marks would not exceed 15% of the total marks allocated to the written examination. 
8.	Furthermore, the rules have been amended to reflect that now there will be no minimum qualifying marks stipulated for the interview. 
9.	Unfortunately for the petitioner, the course correction came after the examination, followed by the interview, was held. The written examination was held on 19.09.2021 while the interviews for the subject post were held between 24.06.2022 to 03.07.2022. The record shows that the final list of successful candidates was published on 26.08.2022. The notification doing away with minimum marks for interview was issued on 18.11.2023.
10.	In our view, the petitioner, after having taken the exam, cannot assail the procedure and rules after he was declared unsuccessful. The cause articulated in the writ petition has, however, received the attention of the court and, as noticed above, necessary course correction has been made. 
11.	It is the contention of Mr Chauhan that in Aalmascase, the concerned candidate was appointed pursuant to an interim order passed by the Supreme Court, on 26.09.2023. 
11.1	The interim direction, as would be evident, was made final by a subsequent order rendered by the Supreme Court on 05.12.2023, in exercise of powers under Article 136 read with Article 142 of the Constitution.
12.	The petitioner cannot claim parity with the decision rendered in Aalmas case. As observed above, insofar as respondent/Delhi High Court is concerned, the aforesaid aspect was brought to its notice and remedial measures were taken.
13.	Thus, for the foregoing reasons, we are not inclined to entertain the writ petition. 
14.	The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
15.	Parties will act based on the digitally signed copy of the judgment.

1. Appellant  impugns  order  dated  14.03.2023  (hereinafter  referred  
to as “Impugned  order ”), whereby  the Learned  Single  Judge  
dismissed  the petition  under  Section  9 of Arbitration  and Conciliation  
Act, 1966  (hereinafter  referred  to as the Arbitration  Act) seeking  to 
restrain  the Respondents  from  selling,  alienating  or transferring  the 
land subject  matter  of a Collaboration  Agreement  dated  15.05.2018,  
entered  into between  Appellant  and Respondent  No.1 . 
2. Appellant,  a limited  liability  Partnership,  of which  Respondent  
No. 2 is the erstwhile  partner  entered  into a Collaboration  Agreement  
on 15.05.2018  with Respondent  No. 1 the owner  of the land 
admeasuring  94 Kanal  & 7 Marla,  or11.79375  acres,  situated  in the 
Revenue  Estate  of Village  Dhunela,  Tehsil  Sohna,  Gurugram,  
Haryana -122001  for the purposes  of the development  of the said land 
(hereinafter  referred  to as the Collaboration  Property).  
3. As per the Appellant,  under the Collaboration  Agreement,  
Appellant  was to develop  the Collaboration  Property  at its own cost 
and was entitled  to sell the developed  land. A portion  of the developed  
land was earmarked  as consideration  for the Respondent  No.1 . 
Besides  the said earmarked  portion,  a sum of Rs. 4.21 Cr. was paid to 
Respondent  No. 1.   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  3 of 40 
 
4. As per the Appellant,  Respondent  No. 1 in collusion  with 
Respondent  No. 2, the erstwhile  partner  illegally  terminated  the 
Collaboration  Agreement  and was seeking  to alienate  and sell the 
Collaboration  Property.   
5. For seeking  interim  measures  of protection , Appellant  filed the 
subject  petition under  Section  9 of the Arbitration  Actinter 
aliaseeking  a direction  to the Respondent  No. 1, to maintain  status  
quo qua possession  and title of the Collaboration  Property  and further  
to restrain  them  from  directly  or indirectly,  selling,  transferring , 
alienating  or creating  any third  party  rights  therein.  
6. By an interim  order  dated  23.12.2022,  the learned  Single  Judge  
directed  maintenance  of status  quo with regard  to title and possession  
of the subject  property.  
7. However,  by the impugned  order  dated  14.03.2023,  learned  
Single  Judge  has dismissed  the Petition  filed seeking  interim  measures  
of protection  under  section  9 of the Act, holding  that, as the 
Collaboration  Agreement  between  the parties  already  stands  
terminated,  there  was an imposs ibility  for this Court  to direct  its 
specific  performance  in a proceedings  under  Section  9 of the Act.   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  4 of 40 
 
8. Aggrieved  by the said decision,  Appellants  have  filed the 
subject  appeal  under  Section  37 of the Act.  
9. At the outset  a preliminary  objection  has been  raised  by the 
Respondents  about  the lack of territorial  jurisdiction  of the courts  at 
Delhi  to entertain  the proceedings  under  the Act.  
10. It is contended  by the Respondents,  that the Collaboration  
property  is situated  in Sohna , Haryana,  the Collaboration  Agreement  
dated  15.05.2018  was executed  in Sohna,  Haryana  contain ing an 
exclusive  jurisdiction  clause  stipulating  all disputes  to be subject  to 
jurisdiction  of courts  at Gurugram/Haryana  alone,  the courts  at Delhi 
would  have  no territorial  jurisdiction  to entertain  the proceedings  
under  the Act. 
11. Per contra,  as per the Appellants,  the Collaboration  Agreement  
contains  an Arbitration  Clause  conferring  jurisdiction  to the courts  at 
Delhi  and as such the courts  at Delhi would  have  the territorial  
jurisdiction  to entertain  the proceedings  under  the Act. 
12. It would  be expedient  to refer  to the respective  clauses  in the 
Collaboration  Agreement  dated  15.05.2018  entered  into between  
Appellant  and Respondent  No. 1. The respect ive Clause  19 and 23  
read as under:   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  5 of 40 
 
“19. Jurisdiction   
19.1  All matters  concerning  these  presents  and the 
development  of the schedule  property  shall  be subject  to 
the jurisdiction  of courts  at Gurugram/Haryana  alone . 
23. Arbitrati on 
23.1.   In the event  any dispute  or difference  arises  out of 
or in connection  with the interpretation  or 
implementation  of this Agreement,  or out of or in 
connection  with the breach,  or alleged  breach  of this 
Agreement,  such dispute  shall  be referred  to arbitration  
under  the Arbitration  and Conciliation  Act, 1996  to be 
decided  by a sole Arbitrator  appointed  mutually  by the 
Parties  hereto.  In case of any difference  between  the 
parties  on appointment  of a sole Arbitrator,  the 
arbitration  tribunal  shall  consist  of three  Arbitrators.  
The SECOND  PARTY  shall  appoint  one Arbitrator  and 
the FIRST  PARTY  shall  appoint  the second  Arbitrator.  
The third  Arbitrator  shall  be appointed  by the two 
selected  Arbitrators  failing  which  such appointment  shall  
be done  by the Arbitration  Council  of India,  New Delhi.  
The decision  taken  by the majority  of Arbitrators  shall  be 
final and binding  on the Parties  hereto.  The venue  of the 
Arbitration  shall  be at Delhi,  India . 
23.1.1.  All proceedings  in any such Arbitration  shall  be 
conducted  in English.  
23.1.2.Each  Party  agrees  to bear its own costs  of 
Arbitration.   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  6 of 40 
 
23.1.3.  The Arbitration  award  made  by the Arbitrators  
shall  be Final  and binding on the Parties  and the 
Parties  agree  to be bound  thereby  and to act 
accordingly.  
23.1.4.  The award  shall  be in writing.  
23.1.5.  The provisions  of this Clause  shall  survive  the 
termination  of this Agreement.”  
 
13. It may be noticed  that clause  19 of the Collaboration  Agreement  
stipulates  that all matters  concerning  the Collaboration  Agreement  and 
the development  of the scheduled  property  have  been  made  subject  to 
the courts  at Gurugram/  Haryana  alone.   
14. On the other  hand  clause  23of the Collaboration  Agreement  
provides  for Arbitration  between  the parties  and stipulates  that the 
venue  of Arbitration  shall  be at Delhi,  India.   
15. Mr. Amit  Sibal,  the Learned  Senior  Counsel  on behalf  of the 
Appellant  submits  that the usage  of the expression  “venue ” in the 
arbitration  clause  by the parties  was intended  to be Seat for 
arbitration,  and not mere  convenient  place.  Thus,  the parties  were  ad 
idem  on New  Delhi  being  the Seat of Arbitration.   
16. He further  submits  that in the petition  filed under  Section  9 of 
the Arbitrat ion Act, Appellant  had specifically  stated  that the venue  of  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  7 of 40 
 
arbitration  was New  Delhi  and that no other  Seat of Arbitration  was 
provided  under  the Collaboration  Agreement.  He submitted  that the 
issue  of jurisdiction  was not raised  before  the learned  single  judge  and 
had been  raised  for the first time in the appeal . He submits  that the 
Respondents  by their conduct  of not objecting  to the Jurisdiction  
before  the learned  single  judge  even  in their reply  have  accepted  the 
jurisdiction  of the courts  at Delhi  and as such are precluded  from  
raising  the same  at this belated  stage.  
17. Learned  senior  counsel  submits  that in the interpretation  of any 
agreement,  the subsequent  conduct  of party  is a relevant  factor .He 
submits  that even  though  the parties  have  intended  New  Delhi  to only 
be venue,  but through  their subsequent  conduct  i.e. exchange  of 
pleadings  in terms  of Section  7(4)(c)  of the Act they have  impliedly  
agreed  to arbitrate  with New  Delhi  being  the Seat of Arbitration.   
18. He further  submits  that in view  of the Section  21 of the Code  of 
Civil  Procedure,  1908 , since  the Respondent s did not object  to 
jurisdiction  before  the Learned  Single  Judgeraising  of objection  in the 
present  appeal  is only an afterthou ght and lacks  ofbona  fides and 
cannot  be permitted  to be raised .   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  8 of 40 
 
19. Learned  senior counsel  appearing  for the Respondent  submit s 
that the appeal  is not maintainable,  in the backdrop  of the 
Collaboration  Agreement,  which  contains  a jurisdiction  clause  and 
arbitration  clause.   He submits  that upon  bare perusal  of Clause  19.1 it 
is evident  that the Collaboration  Agreement  vests  jurisdiction  
exclusively  with courts  of Gurugram/Haryana  ousting  the jurisdiction  
of other  courts.  The usage  of word  „alone‟  in the said clause  makes  it 
abundantly  clear  that the intention  of parties  was to confer  „exclusive  
jurisdiction‟  upon  the courts  of Gurugram/Haryana  only.   
20. He further  submit s that the opening  line of Clause  19.1 i.e., „All 
matters  concerning  these  presents  and the developments  of the 
scheduled  property ‟ itself  suggests  that the said clause  is exhaustive  in 
nature  covering  all aspects  of the collaboration  agreement.  Moreover,  
the rational e to interpret  the phrase  „all matters‟  in the context  
encompasses  all disputes,  differences  etc. arising  in relation  to the 
Agreement  and will include  arbitrable  disputes  also.  
21. He further  submit s that Clause  23 pertaining  to „Arbitration‟  
refers  only to the „venue‟  and not the „seat‟  and cannot  be read as the 
seat in view  of the exception  carved  out by the Supreme  Court  in BGS 
SGS Soma  JV v. NHPC  Ltd. (2020)  4 SCC 234.  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  9 of 40 
 
22. He submit s that the „Arbitration  Clause‟  contained  in the 
Agreement  deliberately  used the word  „venue‟  and not „seat‟  thereby  
substan tiating  the intention  of the parties  that only the geographical  
location  of the arbitration  proceedings/meetings  will be at Delhi  and 
the word  „venue‟  used in Clause  23.1 could  not be interpreted  as „Seat 
of Arbitration ‟ as „Delhi‟.  
23. Learned  Senior  counsel  for the Respondent  further  submits  that 
reliance  on Section  7(4)(c)  of the Arbitration  Act is misplaced  as there  
is no alleged  written  „Arbitration  Agreement‟  contained  in the 
pleadings  which  have  been  exchanged  between  the parties.  Therefore,  
the Collaboration  Agreement,  in whole  remains  undisputed  till date 
and the arbitration  agreement  in question  is clearly  contained  in the 
said Collaboration  Agreement  and not the pleadings.  
24. He further  submit s that the issue  of territorial  jurisdi ction,  is a 
pure question  of law and could  be raised  at any stage  of the 
proceedings  and the bar of Section  21 of the Code  of Civil  Procedure,  
could  not be applied.  
25. Reference  may be had to the judgment  of the Supreme  Court  of 
India  in BGS SGS Soma  JV v. NHPC Ltd., (2020)  4 SCC 234wherein  
it is held as under:

“38.  A reading  of paras  75, 76, 96, 110, 116, 123 and 
194 of Balco  [Balco  v. Kaiser  Aluminium  Technical  
Services  Inc., (2012)  9 SCC 552 : (2012)  4 SCC (Civ)  
810]  would  show  that where  parties  have  selected  the 
seat of arbitration  in their  agreement,  such selection  
would  then amount  to an exclusive  jurisdiction  clause,  as 
the parties  have  now indicated  that the courts  at the 
“seat”  would  alone  have  jurisdiction  to entertain  
challenges  against  the arbitral  award  which  have  been 
made  at the seat. The example  given  in para  96 
buttresses  this proposition,  and is supported  by the 
previous  and subsequent  paragraphs  pointed  out 
hereinabove.  The Balco  [Balco  v. Kaiser  Alumin ium 
Technical  Services  Inc., (2012)  9 SCC 552 : (2012)  4 
SCC (Civ)  810]  judgment,  when  read as a whole,  applies  
the concept  of “seat”  as laid down  by the English  
judgments  (and which  is in Section  20 of the Arbitration  
Act, 1996),  by harmoniously  construin g Section  20 with 
Section  2(1)(e),  so as to broaden  the definition  of 
“court”,  and bring  within  its ken courts  of the “seat”  of 
the arbitration . 
*****    *****    *****  
40.  Para  96 of Balco  case [Balco  v. Kaiser  Aluminium  
Technical  Services  Inc., (2012)  9 SCC 552 : (2012)  4 
SCC (Civ)  810]  is in several  parts.  First  and foremost,  
Section  2(1)(e),  which  is the definition  of “court”  under  
the Arbitration  Act, 1996  was referred  to, and was 
construed  keeping  in view the provisions  in Section  20 of 
the Arbitration  Act, 1996,  which  give recognition  to party  
autonomy  in choosing  the seat of the arbitration  
proceedings.  Secondly,  the Court  went  on to state  in two  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  11 of 40 
 
places  in the said paragraph  that jurisdiction  is given  to 
two sets of courts,  namely,  those  courts  which  would  
have  jurisdiction  where  the cause  of action  is located;  
and those  courts  where  the arbitration  takes  place.  
However,  when  it came  to providing  a neutral  place  as 
the “seat”  of arbitration  proceedings,  the example  given  
by the five-Judge  Bench  made  it clear  that appeals  under  
Section  37 of the Arbitration  Act, 1996  against  interim  
orders  passed  under  Section  17 of the Arbitration  Act, 
1996  would  lie only to the courts  of the seat — which  is 
Delhi  in that example  — which  are the courts  having  
supervisory  control,  or jurisdiction,  over the arbitration  
proceedings . The example  then goes on to state  that this 
would  be irrespective  of the fact that the obligations  to be 
perfo rmed  under  the contract,  that is the cause  of action,  
may arise  in part either  at Mumbai  or Kolkata.  The fact 
that the arbitration  is to take place  in Delhi  is of 
importance.  However,  the next sentence  in the said 
paragraph  reiterates  the concurrent  jurisd iction  of both 
courts.  
*****    *****    *****  
49.  Take  the consequence  of the opposite  conclusion,  
in the light of the facts  of a given  example,  as follows.  
New Delhi  is specifically  designated  to be the seat of the 
arbitration  in the arbitration  clause  between  the parties.  
Part of the cause  of action,  however,  arises  in several  
places,  including  where  the contract  is partially  to be 
performed,  let us say, in a remote  part of Uttarakhand.  If 
concurrent  jurisdiction  were  to be the order  of the day, 
despite  the seat having  been  located  and specifically  
chosen  by the parties,  party  autonomy  would  suffer,   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  12 of 40 
 
which  Balco  [Balco  v. Kaiser  Aluminium  Technical  
Services  Inc., (2012)  9 SCC 552 : (2012)  4 SCC (Civ)  
810]  specifically  states  cannot  be the case. Thus,  if an 
application  is made  to a District  Court  in a remote  
corner  of the Uttarakhand  hills,  which  then becomes  the 
court  for the purposes  of Section  42 of the Arbitration  
Act, 1996  where  even Section  34 applications  have  then 
to be made,  the result  would  be contr ary to the stated  
intention  of the parties  — as even though  the parties  have 
contemplated  that a neutral  place  be chosen  as the seat 
so that the courts  of that place  alone  would  have  
jurisdiction,  yet, any one of five other  courts  in which  a 
part of the cause of action  arises,  including  courts  in 
remote  corners  of the country,  would  also be clothed  with 
jurisdiction.  This obviously  cannot  be the case.  If, 
therefore,  the conflicting  portion  of the judgment  
of Balco  [Balco  v. Kaiser  Aluminium  Technical  Servic es 
Inc., (2012)  9 SCC 552 : (2012)  4 SCC (Civ)  810]  in 
para  96 is kept aside  for a moment,  the very fact that 
parties  have  chosen  a place  to be the seat would  
necessarily  carry  with it the decision  of both parties  that 
the courts  at the seat would  exclusiv ely have  jurisdiction  
over the entire  arbitral  process . 
50.  In fact, subsequent  Division  Benches  of this Court  
have  understood  the law to be that once  the seat of 
arbitration  is chosen,  it amounts  to an exclusive  
jurisdiction  clause,  insofar  as the courts  at that seat are 
concerned . In Enercon  (India)  Ltd. v. Enercon  
GmbH  [Enercon  (India)  Ltd. v. Enercon  GmbH,  (2014)  5 
SCC 1 : (2014)  3 SCC (Civ)  59] , this Court  approved  the 
dictum  in Shashoua  [Shashoua  v. Sharma,  2009  EWHC  
957 (Comm)  : (2009)  2 Lloyd's  Law Rep 376]  as follows

“126.  Examining  the fact situation  in the case,  the 
Court  in Shashoua  case [Shashoua  v. Sharma,  
2009  EWHC  957 (Comm)  : (2009)  2 Lloyd's  Law 
Rep 376]  observed  as follows:  
„The basis  for the court's  grant  of an anti-suit 
injunction  of the kind sought  depended  upon  
the seat of the arbitration.  An agreement  as to the 
seat of an arbitration  brought  in the law of that 
country  as the curial  law and was analogous  to an 
exclusive  jurisdiction  clause.  Not only was there  
agreement  to the curial  law of the seat, but also to 
the courts  of the seat having  supervisory  
jurisdiction  over the arbitration,  so that, by 
agreeing  to the seat, the parties  agreed  that any 
challenge  to an interim  or final award  was to be 
made  only in the courts  of the place  designated  as 
the seat of the arbitration . 
Although,  “venue”  was not synonymous  with 
“seat”,  in an arbitration  clause  which  provided  for 
arbitration  to be conducted  in accordance  with the 
Rules  of the ICC in Paris  (a supranational  body  of 
rules),  a provision  that “the venue  of arbitration  
shall  be London,  United  Kingdom”  did amount  to 
the designation  of a juridical  seat.…‟

Tests  for determination  of “seat”   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  14 of 40 
 
60.  The judgments  of the English  courts  have  
examined  the concept  of the “juridical  seat”  of the 
arbitral  proceedings,  and have  laid down  several  
important  tests in order  to determine  whether  the “seat”  
of the arbitral  proceedings  has, in fact, been  indicated  in 
the agreement  between  the parties . The judgment  of 
Cooke,  J., in Shashoua  [Shashoua  v. Sharma,  2009  
EWHC  957 (Comm)  : (2009)  2 Lloyd's  Law Rep 376]  , 
states:  
“34. London  arbitration  is a well-known  
phenomenon  which is often  chosen  by foreign  
nationals  with a different  law, such as the law of 
New York,  governing  the substantive  rights  of the 
parties.  This is because  of the legislative  
framework  and supervisory  powers  of the courts  
here which  many  parties  are keen to adopt.  When  
therefore  there  is an express  designation  of the 
arbitration  venue  as London  and no designation  of 
any alternative  place  as the seat, combined  with a 
supranational  body  of rules  governing  the 
arbitration  and no other  significant  contrary  
indicia, the inexorable  conclusion  is, to my mind,  
that London  is the juridical  seat and English  Law 
the curial  law. In my judgment  it is clear  that 
either  London  has been  designated  by the parties  
to the arbitration  agreement  as the seat of the 
arbitration,  or, having  regard  to the parties'  
agreement  and all the relevant  circumstances,  it is 
the seat to be determined  in accordance  with the 
final fall back  provision  of Section  3 of the 
Arbitration  Act.”   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  15 of 40 
 
61.  It will thus be seen that wherever  there  is an 
expres s designation  of a “venue”,  and no designation  of 
any alternative  place  as the “seat”,  combined  with a 
supranational  body  of rules  governing  the arbitration,  
and no other  significant  contrary  indicia,  the inexorable  
conclusion  is that the stated  venue  is actually  the 
juridical  seat of the arbitral  proceeding . 
62.  In Enercon  GmbH  v. Enercon  (India)  
Ltd. [Enercon  GmbH  v. Enercon  (India)  Ltd., 2012  
EWHC  689 (Comm)  : (2012)  1 Lloyd's  Rep 519]  , the 
arbitration  clause  between  the parties  read as follows:  
“18.3.  All proceedings  in such arbitration  shall  be 
conducted  in English.  The venue  of the arbitration  
proceedings  shall  be London.  The arbitrators  may 
(but shall  not be obliged  to) award  costs  and 
reasonable  expenses  (including  reasonable  fees of 
counsel)  to the party(ies)  that substantially  prevail  
on merit.  The provisions  of the Indian  Arbitration  
and Conciliation  Act, 1996  shall  apply.”  
63.  The Court  in Enercon  GmbH  [Enercon  
GmbH  v. Enercon  (India)  Ltd., 2012  EWHC  689 (Comm)  
: (2012)  1 Lloyd's  Rep 519]  began  its discussion  on the 
“seat”  of the arbitration  by referring  
to Shashoua  [Shashoua  v. Sharma,  2009  EWHC  957 
(Comm)  : (2009)  2 Lloyd's  Law Rep 376]  , and then 
referring  to “The  Conflict  of Laws”,  Dicey,  Morris  & 
Collins,  14th Edn. as follows:  
“58. Moreover,  as Cooke,  J. noted,  this conclusion  
is consistent  with the views  expressed  in The 
Conflict  of Laws,  Dicey,  Morris & Collins,   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  16 of 40 
 
14thEdition  at 16-035 where  the authors  state 
that the seat “is in most  cases  sufficiently  indicated  
by the country  chose n as the place  of the 
arbitration.  For such a choice  of place  not to be 
given  effect  as a choice  of seat, there  will need  to 
be clear  evidence  that the parties  … agreed  to 
choose  another  seat for the arbitration  and that 
such a choice  will be effective  to endow  the courts  
of that country  with jurisdiction  to supervise  and 
support  the arbitration”.  
59.  Apart  from  the last sentence  in Clause  18.3 
(i.e. “The  provisions  of the Indian  Arbitration  and 
Conciliation  Act, 1996  shall  apply”),  it seems  to 
me that the conclusion  that London  is the “seat”  of 
any arbitration  there -under  is beyond  any possible  
doubt.  Thus,  the main  issue  is whether  this last 
sentence  is to be regarded  as “significant  contrary  
indicia”  (using  the language  of Cooke,  J.) so as to 
place  the “seat”  of the arbitration  in India.  A 
similar  issue  was considered  by Saville,  J. 
in Union  of India  v. McDonnell  Douglas  [Union  of 
India  v. McDonnell  Douglas  Corpn.,  (1993)  2 
Lloyd's  Rep 48] which,  of course,  pre-dates  the 
English  1996  Act. The arbitration  agreement  in 
that case provided  as follows:“In  the event  of a 
dispute  arising  out of or in connection  with this 
agreement…the  same  shall  be referred  to an 
Arbitration  Tribunal…The  arbitration  shall  be 
conducted  in accordance  with the procedure  
provided  in the Indian  Arbitration  Act of 1940  or 
any enactment  or modification  thereof.  The 
arbitration  shall  be conducted  in the English   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  17 of 40 
 
language…The  seat of the arbitration  proceedings  
shall  be London,  United  Kingdom.”  Saville,  J. 
expressed  the view that the argume nts on both 
sides  were  “finely  balanced”  but in effect  
concluded  that the reference  to the Indian  
Arbitration  Act, 1940  did not have  the effect  of 
changing  the “seat”  of the arbitration  designated  
by the parties.  Rather,  the phrase  referring  to the 
1940  Act was to be reconciled  with the rest of the 
clause  by reading  it as referring  to the internal  
conduct  of the arbitration  as opposed  to the 
external  supervision  of the arbitration  by the 
courts.”  
64.  The Court  in Enercon  GmbH  [Enercon  
GmbH  v. Enercon  (Indi a) Ltd., 2012  EWHC  689 (Comm)  
: (2012)  1 Lloyd's  Rep 519]  then held that although  the 
word  “venue”  is not synonymous  with “seat”,  on the 
facts  of that case,  London  — though  described  as the 
“venue”  — was really  the “seat”  of the arbitration.  This 
was for the reason  that London  was a neutral  place  in 
which  neither  party  worked  for gain,  and in which  no 
part of the cause  of action  arose.  It was thus understood  
to be a neutral  place  in which  the proceedings  could  be 
“anchored”.  Secondly,  the Court  stressed  on the 
expression  “arbitration  proceedings”  in Clause  18.3,  
which  the Court  held to be an expression  which  included  
not just one or more  individual  hearings,  but the arbitral  
proceedings  as a whole,  culminating  in the making  of an 
award.  The Court  held:  
63.  Second,  the language  in Clause  18.3 refers  
to the “arbitration  proceedings”.  That is an  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  18 of 40 
 
expression  which  includes  not just one or more  
individual  or particular  hearings  but the 
arbitration  proceedings  as a whole  including  the 
making  of an award.  In other  words the parties  
were  anchoring  the whole  arbitration  process  in 
London  right  up to and including  the making  of an 
award.  The place  designated  for the making  of an 
award  is a designation  of seat. Moreover  the 
language  in Clause  18.3 does not refer  to the 
venue  of all hearings  “taking  place”  in London.  
Clause  18.3 instead  provides  that the venue  of the 
arbitration  proceedings  “shall  be” London.  This 
again  suggests  the parties  intended  to anchor  the 
arbitration  proceedings  to and in London  rather  
than simply  physically  locating  the arbitration  
hearings  in London.  Indeed  in a case where  
evidence  might  need  to be taken  or perhaps  more  
likely  inspected  in India  it would  make  no 
commercial  sense  to construe  the provision  as 
mandating  all hearings  to take place  in a physical  
place  as opposed  to anchoring  the arbitral  process  
to and in a designated  place.  All agreements  
including  an arbitration  agreement  should  be 
construed  to accord  with business  common  sense.  
In my view,  there  is no business  common  sense  to 
constru e the arbitration  agreement  (as contended  
for by EIL) in a manner  which  would  simply  
deprive  the arbitrators  of an important  discretion  
that they possess  to hear evidence  in a convenient  
geographical  location.  
64. Third,  Joseph  QC submitted  that the last 
sentence  of Clause  18.3 can be reconciled  with the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  19 of 40 
 
choice  of London  as the seat. First,  he submitted  
that it can be read as referring  simply  to Part II of 
the Indian  1996  Act i.e. the enforcement  
provisions.  Edey  QC's  response  was that if that is 
all the last sentence  meant,  then it would  be 
superfluous.  However,  I do not consider  that any 
such superfluity  carries  much,  if any, weight.  
Alternatively,  Joseph  QC submitted  that it can be 
read as referring  only to those  provisions  of the 
Indian  1996  Act which  were not inconsistent  with 
the English  1996  Act.”  
*****    *****    *****  
82.  On a conspectus  of the aforesaid  judgments,  it may 
be concluded  that whenever  there  is the designation  of a 
place  of arbitration  in an arbitration  clause  as being  the 
“venue”  of the arbitration  proceedings,  the expression  
“arbitration  proceedings”  would  make  it clear  that the 
“venue”  is really  the “seat”  of the arbitral  proceedings,  
as the aforesaid  expression  does not include  just one or 
more  individual  or particular  hearing,  but the arbitration  
proceedings  as a whole,  including  the making  of an 
award  at that place.  This language  has to be contrasted  
with language  such as “tribunals  are to meet  or have  
witnesses,  experts  or the parties”  where  only hearings  
are to take place  in the “venue”,  which  may lead to the 
conclusion,  other  things  being  equal,  that the venue  so 
stated  is not the “seat”  of arbitral  proceedings,  but only 
a convenient  place  of meeting.  Further,  the fact that the 
arbitral  proceedings  “shall  be held”  at a particula r 
venue  would  also indicate  that the parties  intended  to 
anchor  arbitral  proceedings  to a particular  place,   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  20 of 40 
 
signifying  thereby,  that that place  is the seat of the 
arbitral  proceedings.  This,  coupled  with there  being  no 
other  significant  contrary  indicia  that the stated  venue  is 
merely  a “venue”  and not the “seat”  of the arbitral  
proceedings,  would  then conclusively  show  that such a 
clause  designates  a “seat”  of the arbitral  proceedings.  In 
an international  context,  if a supranational  body  of rules  
is to govern the arbitration,  this would  further  be an 
indicia  that “the venue”,  so stated,  would  be the seat of 
the arbitral  proceedings.  In a national  context,  this 
would  be replaced  by the Arbitration  Act, 1996  as 
applying  to the “stated  venue”,  which  then becom es the 
“seat”  for the purposes  of arbitration.  
(underlining  supplied)  
 
26. The Supreme  Court  in BGS SGS Soma  JV, referring  to Balco  
(supra) , held that where  parties  had selected  the Seat of Arbitration  in 
their agreement,  such selection  would  amount  to an exclusive  
jurisdiction  clause,  as the parties  had indicated  that the courts  at the 
“seat”  would  alone  have  jurisdiction  to entertain  challenges  against  
the arbitral  award  which  have  been  made  at the seat. Further,  if 
jurisdiction  is given  to two sets of courts,  namely,  those  courts  which  
would  have  jurisdiction  where  the cause  of action  is located;  and those  
courts  where  the arbitration  takes  place  all proceedings  would  lie only 
to the courts  of the Seat which  are the courts  having  supervisory  
control,  or jurisdiction,  over the arbitration  proceedings .It held that if  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  21 of 40 
 
concurrent  jurisdiction  were  to be the order  of the day, despite  the seat 
having  been  located  and specifically  chosen  by the parties, party  
autonomy  would  suffer,  which  as per the Supreme  Court  
Balco  (supra)  specifically  stated  could  not be the case.  
27. The Supreme Court further held that the very fact that parties 
had chosen a place to be the seat would necessarily carry with it the 
decision of both parties that the courts at the seat would exclusively 
have jurisdiction over the entire arbitral process. Once the seat of 
arbitration is chosen, it amounted to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, 
insofar as the courts at that seat are concer ned. 
28. Referring to Shashoua  v. Sharma (supra) , the Supreme Court in 
BGS SGS Soma JV (supra)  held that not only was there agreement to 
the curial law of the  seat, but also to the courts of the  seat having 
supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, so that, by agreeing to 
the seat, the parties agreed that any challenge to an interim or final 
award was to be made only in the courts of the place designated as the 
seat of the arbitration. It further held that although, “venue” was not 
synonymous with “seat”, in an arbitration clause which provided for 
arbitration to be conducted in accordance with  the Rules of the ICC in 
Paris (a supranational body of rules), a provision that “the  venue  of  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  22 of 40 
 
arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom” did amount to the 
designation of a juridical seat.…‟.  
29. The Supreme Court held that the judgments of the English 
courts had examined the concept of the “juridical seat” of the arbitral 
proceedings, and laid down several important tests in order to 
determine whether the “seat” of the arbitral proceedings has, in fact, 
been indicated in the agreement between the parties.  
30. Referring to Shashoua  v. Sharma (supra)  it was held that 
wherever there is an express designation of a “venue”, and no 
designation of any alternative place as the “seat”, combined with a 
supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other 
significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated 
venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding.  
31. The Supreme Court also referred to the Conflict of Laws, Dicey, 
Morris & Collins, 14th Edition at 16 -035 and noted th at seat was in 
most cases was sufficiently indicated by the country chosen as the 
place of the arbitration. For such a choice of place not to be given 
effect as a choice of seat, there would need to be clear evidence that 
the parties agreed to choose anoth er seat for the arbitration.   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  23 of 40 
 
32. The Supreme Court referred to Enercon GmbH (supra) and 
noted that the Court had held that although the word “venue” was not 
synonymous with “seat”, on the facts of that case, London — though 
described as the “venue” — was reall y the “seat” of the arbitration. 
This was for the reason that London was a neutral place in which 
neither party worked for gain, and in which no part of the cause of 
action arose.  
33. It noted that parties were anchoring the whole arbitration 
process in London  right up to and including the making of an award 
and held that the place designated for the making of an award is a 
designation of seat. It held that the language in Clause 18.3 did not 
refer to the venue of all hearings “taking place” in London instead 
provided that the venue of the arbitration proceedings “shall be” 
London. This suggested that the parties intended to anchor the 
arbitration proceedings to and in London rather than simply physically 
locating the arbitration hearings in London.  
34. After consi dering various Indian and English Judgments, the 
Supreme Court concluded that whenever there is the designation of a 
place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the “venue” of the 
arbitration proceedings, the expression “arbitration proceedings”  
would make it clear that the “venue” is really the “seat” of the arbitral  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  24 of 40 
 
proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or 
more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings 
as a whole, including the making of an a ward at that place. Further, 
the fact that the arbitral proceedings “shall be held”  at a particular 
venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral 
proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is 
the seat of  the arbitral proceedings.  
35. Similar  view  has been  expressed  by several  judicial  
pronouncements  rendered  by learned  single  judges  of this court.   
Reference  may be had to some  of such judgements .  
36. In Dholi  Spintex  Pvt. Ltd. vs. Louis  Dreyfus  Company  Pvt. Ltd., 
2020  SCC OnLine  Del 1476 considering  the term „Venue‟  used in 
clause 6 of the agreement  learned  single  judge  held that by agreeing  to 
conduct  the arbitration  through  International  Cotton  Association  (ICA 
for short) , parties  had agreed  that the seat of arbitration  would  be 
London  and not Delhi  even  though  by Clause  7 the Substantive  Law 
of the contract  was Indian  Law and parties  had agreed  to exclusive  
jurisdiction  of the Courts  at Delhi.  It was held that per clause  6, 
parties  had specifically  agreed  that any dispute  arising  out of the 
contract  shall  be resolved  through  arbitration  in accordance  with 
International  Cotton  Association  Rules  and arbitration  procedure,  the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  25 of 40 
 
parties  had thus agreed  to abide  by the rules  and byelaws  of the ICA 
which  provide d that the seat of arbitration  is in London  and the law of 
England  and Wales  shall  apply  to every  arbitration  and/or  appeal  
under  these  byelaws.  The Court  held that Clause  7 entered  into 
between  the parties  would  be relevant  if by an agreement  both parties  
decide  not to settle  their disputes  through  arbitration  but by 
approaching  the Court  of law, in which  case the exclusive  jurisdiction  
would  be of the Courts  at New  Delhi.  
37. In M/s Cable  Corporation  of India  Ltd. v. M/s Jay Pee Sports  
International  Ltd., 2018  SCC OnLine  Del 10340 where  the Dispute  
Resolution  and Arbitration  Clause  stipulated  the Venue  of Arbitration  
as New  Delhi  but the Governing  Laws  and Jurisdiction clause  
stipulating  that the district  Courts  of Gautam  Budh  Nagar  and High 
Court  of Judicature  at Allahabad  shall  have exclusive  jurisdiction  over 
all matters  arising  out of or related  to this Contract , a learned  single  
judge  of this court  referring  to the decision  of the Supreme  Court  in 
Indus  Mobile  Distribution  Pvt. Ltd. v. Datawind  Innovations  Pvt. 
Ltd. (2017)  7 SCC 678 and Enercon  (India)  Ltd. v. Enercon  
Gmbh,  (2014)  5 SCC 1 and noted  that like in the present  case,  the 
Arbitration  Clause  was distinct  from  the Jurisdictio nClause  and noted  
that the arbitration  clause  in that case was Clause  31 with the heading   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  26 of 40 
 
“Disputes  Resolution  and Arbitration” . Clause  31.2 clearly  stipulated  
that the venue  of arbitration  shall  be New  Delhi.  Clause  38 had a 
heading  “Governing  Laws  and Jurisdiction” . It was not dealing  with 
arbitration.  Clause  31 was a provision  dealing  only in arbitration  and 
would  apply  in relation  to arbitration  proceedings.  As the arbitration  
proceedings  are to be held in Delhi,  the courts  in Delhi  would  exercise  
jurisdiction  over the arbitration  process  and the seat of arbitration  
would  be Delhi.  Clause  38 being  a general  provision  would  be 
applicable  to proceedings  that may take placeother  than the arbitration  
proceedings.  This would  be the appropriate  harmonious  interpretation  
of the two clauses  of the agreement  between  the parties.  
38. In Gauri  Dwivedi  v. Director  News  Pvt. Ltd. 2023  SCC OnLine  
Del 2367 the learned  single  judge  held that the Juridical  or legal  seat of 
arbitration  once  designated  or determined  exclusively  determines  
which  courts will have  jurisdiction  over the arbitration,  as opposed  to 
the place  where  whole  or part of the cause  of action  arises.  Thus,  once  
the seat of arbitration  is designated  or determined,  the same  operates  
as an exclusive  jurisdiction  clause  as a result  of which  only the courts  
where  the seat is located  would  have  jurisdiction  over the arbitration,  
to the exclusion  of all other  courts,  even  courts  where  part of the cause  
of action  may have  arisen.  The Test for determination  of juridical  seat  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  27 of 40 
 
wherever  there  is an express  designation  of a “venue”,  and no 
designation  of any alternative  place  as the “seat”  is the Shashoua  
principle  which  states  that wherever  there  is an express  designation  of 
a “venue”,  and no designation  of any alternative  place  as the “seat”,  
the inexorable  conclusion  is that the stated  venue  is actually  the 
juridical  seat of the arbitral  proceeding,  to the exclusion  of all other  
courts,  even  courts  where  part of the cause  of action  may have  arisen.  
39. The learned  Judge  further  held that “wheneve r there  is the 
designation  of a place  of arbitration  in an arbitration  clause  as being  
the “venue”  of the arbitration  proceedings,  the expression  
“arbitration  proceedings”  would  make  it clear  that the “venue”  is 
really  the “seat”  of the arbitral  proceeding s, as “arbitration  
proceedings”  does not include  just one or more  individual  or 
particular  hearing,  but the arbitrationproceedings  as a whole,  
including  the making  of an award  at that place.  Further,  the fact that 
the arbitral  proceedings  “shall  be held”  at a particular  venue  would  
also indicate  that the parties  intend  to anchor  arbitral  proceedings  to 
a particular  place,  signifying  thereby,  that that place  is the seat of the 
arbitral  proceedings.  This,  coupled  with there  being  no other  
significant  contrary  indicia  that the stated  venue  is merely  a “venue”  
and not the “seat”  of the arbitral  proceedings,  would  then  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  28 of 40 
 
conclusively  show  that such a clause  designates  a “seat”  of the 
arbitral  proceedings,  to the exclusion  of all other  courts,  even courts  
where  part of the cause  of action  may have  arisen.”  
40. Similar  view  if expressed  in Cinepolis  India  Pvt. Ltd. v. 
Celebration  City Projects  Pvt. Ltd. 2020  SCC Online  Del 301wherein  
the court  referring  to the clauses  of the agreement  noted  that parties  by 
agreement  had conferred  exclusive  jurisdiction  on the subject  matter  
of the agreement  on the courts  in Ghaziabad,  while  the place  of the 
arbitration  was New  Delhi.  Learned  judge  held that while it was true 
that the arbitration  clause  did not specifically  use the word  “seat”  but 
it was no longer  res integra  that the term “place”  would  be the 
“juridical  seat”  for the purpose  of Section  2(2) of the Act and the 
word  “place”  was equivalent  to “venue”.   
41. In Raman  Deep  Singh  Taneja  v. Crown  Realtech  Private 
Limited  2017  SCC OnLine  Del 11966 , referring  to Balco  (Supra) , it 
was held that a distinction  is to be drawn  between  “Subject -Matter  of 
the Arbitration”  and “Subject -Matter  of the Suit”.  For the purposes  of 
identifying  the Court,  which  shall  have  supervisory  control  over the 
arbitral  proceedings,  it would  be the Court  where  the „Subject -Matter  
of Arbitration‟  is situated  that would  have  precedence  over the Court  
where  the “Subject -Matter  of the Suit”  is situated.  Therefore,  the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  29 of 40 
 
exclusivejurisdiction  conferred  due to venue  of arbitration  would  take 
precedence  over the exclusive  jurisdiction  vested  over the Subject -
Matter  of the suit and the Court  having  jurisdiction  over the 
arbitration  proceedings  would  have  precedence  over the Court  which  
has jurisdiction  over the Subject -Matter  of the suit or where  the cause  
of action  has arisen.  The court  held that the purported  conflict  
between  the two parts could  be resolved  by holding  that where  the 
disputes  are to be adjudicated  without  reference  to the arbitration,  
Courts  at Delhi  would  have  exclusive  jurisdiction,  however,  where  
they have  to be resolved  through  arbitration,  venue  being  at 
Faridabad,  Haryana,  the Courts  at Faridabad,  State  of Haryana,  would  
have  exclusive  jurisdiction.  
42. In Reliance  Infrastructure  Limited  v. Madhyanchal  Vidyut  
Vitran  Nigam  Limited  2023  SCC OnLine  Del 4894 , another  learned  
single  judge  of this court  referring  to several  judgments  held that the 
choice  of Delhi  as the venue  of arbitration  was demonstrative  of the 
fact that the arbitral  proceedings  were  intended  to be anchored  to 
Delhi,  and in the absence  of any contrary  indicia,  the inexorable  
conclusion  was that Delhi  is the seat of Arbitration. It was further  held 
that when  the contract  contains  an arbitration  clause  that specifies  a 
“venue”,  thereby  anchoring  the arbitral  proceedings  thereto,  then the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  30 of 40 
 
said “venue”  is really  the “seat”  of arbitration.  In such a situation  the 
courts  having  supervisory  jurisdiction  over the said “seat”  shall  
exercise  supervisory  jurisdiction  over the arbitral  process,  
notwithstanding  that the contract  contains  a clause  seeking  to confer  
“exclusive  jurisdiction”  on a different  court.  Further , that a generic  
clause,  not specifically  refer ring to arbitration  proceedings  would  not 
serve  as a “contrary  indicia”  so as to denude  the jurisdiction  of the 
Courts  having  jurisdiction  over the “seat”  of Arbitration.  
43. Coming  back  to the facts  of the present  case,  reference  has been  
made  by the parties  to two different  clauses  of the Collaboration  
Agreement.  One is clause  19 (Jurisdiction)  which  stipulates  that all 
matters  concerning  the agreement  and the development  of the 
schedule  property  shall  be subject  to the jurisdiction  of courts  at 
Gurugram  Haryana  alone.  The other  being  clause 23 (Arbitration)  
stipulat ing that “In the event  any dispute or difference  arises  out of or 
in connection  with the interpretation  or implementation  of this 
Agreement,  or out of or in connection  with the breach,  or alleged  
breach  of this Agreement,  such dispute  shall  be referred  to arbitration  
under  the Arbitrat ion and Conciliation  Act, 1996  to be decided  by a 
sole Arbitrator  appointed  mutually  by the Parties  hereto.  In case of 
any difference  between  the parties  on appointment  of a sole  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  31 of 40 
 
Arbitrator,  the arbitration  tribunal  shall  consist  of three  Arbitrators.  
The SECOND  PARTY  shall  appoint  one Arbitrator  and the FIRST  
PARTY  shall  appoint  the second  Arbitrator.  The third  Arbitrator  shall  
be appointed  by the two selected  Arbitrators  failing  which  such 
appointment  shall  be done  by the Arbitration  Council  of India,  New 
Delhi.  The decision  taken  by the majority  of Arbitrators  shall  be final 
and binding  on the Parties  hereto.  The venue  of the Arbitration  shall  
be at Delhi,  India  
44. Clause  23 is the Arbitration  clause  and it is distinct  from  clause  
19. The Arbitration  contrac t is contained  in Clause  23 and it is a 
complete  contract  between  the parties  relating  to arbitration.  When  
clause  23 is read,  it clearly  establishes  that the parties  agreed  that the 
Venue  of the entire  Arbitration  proceedings  would  be Delhi,  India.  
Even  in case of a disagreement  between  the two selected  arbitrators,  
the appointment  of the third  arbitrator  is to be done  by the Arbitration  
Council  of India , New Delhi   Clause  23.1.5,  which  is under  the main  
Clause  23 pertaining  to Arbitration  stipulates  that the provisions  of the 
Clause  shall  survive  the termination  of the Agreement.  This clearly  
shows  that Clause  23 pertaining  to Arbitration  is distinct  from  the 
Collaboration  Agreement  and is to survive  even  the termination  of the 
Agreement.    
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  32 of 40 
 
45. Clause  23 provid es for Venue  of the Arbitration  and thus in 
terms  of the Judgment  of the Supreme  Court  in BGS SGS Soma  JV 
(supra)  and Balco  (Supra)  would  amount  to the Juridical  Seat of 
Arbitration  and thus the courts  at Delhi  would  have  the exclusive  
jurisdiction  over the entire  arbitral  process.  The Arbitration  clause  
provides  that all dispute  or difference  arises  out of or in connection  
with the interpretation  or implementation  of this Agreement,  or out of 
or in connection  with the breach,  or alleged  breach  of this Agre ement  
are to be settled  through  Arbitration.  There  are no contra  indicia  in the 
instant  case to indicate  otherwise.  
46. On the other  hand  Clause  19 provides  that all matters  
concerning  these  presents  and the development  of the schedule  
property  shall  be subject  to the jurisdiction  of courts  at 
Gurugram/Haryana.   
47. Arbitration  is stipulated  by Clause  23 which  is distinct  from  
Clause  19 providing  for jurisdiction.  Clause 19 being  a general  
provision  would  be applicable  to proceedings  that may take place, 
other  than arbitration  proceedings  and would  cover  all matters  that are 
not subject  matter  of arbitration.   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  33 of 40 
 
48. Accordingly,  the Courts  at Delhi  would  have  the exclusive  
jurisdiction  to entertain  all proceedings  covered  by Clause  23 i.e. the 
Arbitration  Clause.   
49. Looked  at from  another  angle , it may be noted  that Respondent  
did not object  to the assertion  of the Appellant,  that the Venue  agreed  
between  the Parties  being  Delhi,  the Courts  at Delhi  would  have  the 
territorial  jurisdiction.   
50. Appellants  in their Petition  under  section  9 of the Act stated  as 
under:  
“55. The Petitioner  submits  that this Hon'ble  Court  has 
the territorial  jurisdiction  to try and entertain  the present  
Petition  inasmuch  as the venue  of arbitration  under  
Clause  23.1 of the Collaboration  Agreement  is New 
Delhi  and therefore  this Hon'ble  Court  is exerc ising 
supervisory  jurisdiction  over the arbitration  proceedings  
to be initiated.  The Petitioner  submits  that the 
Collaboration  Agreement  does not provide  for any other  
""seat""  of arbitration  and also provides  that the arbitrator  
shall  be appointed  by the Arbitration  Council  of India,  
New Delhi  in the event  of failure  of any of the Parties  to 
appoint  an arbitrator.  Accordingly,  New Delhi  is deemed  
to be the seat of arbitration  and in view of the Judgement  
of the Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in BGS SGS Soma  JV vs. 
NHPC  (2020)  4 SCC 234, the Courts  at New Delhi  have 
the exclusive  jurisdiction  to deal in respect  of any matters  
arising  out of the arbitration  clause.  The Petitioner  
submits  that Clause  19 of the Collaboration  Agreement   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  34 of 40 
 
providing  for jurisdiction  of Courts  at Gurugram  is 
irrelevant  and would  only apply  in relation  to matters  
outside  of the Arbitration  Agreement. ” 
51. In the reply  filed by the respondent  No. 1 on 23.01.2013  before  
the learned  single  judge  no denial  was made  to the above  assertion  by 
the Appellant.  Similarly , in the reply  filed by Respondent  No. 2 on 
30.01.2023  before  the learned  single  judge  no denial  was made  to the 
above  assertion  by the Appellant , about the territorial  jurisdictio n of 
the courts  at Delhi  and the venue  being  the seat.  
52. Respondent  before  the learned  single  judge  have  not denied  the 
assertion  of the Appellant  that Venue  being  in Delhi  is the Seat of 
Arbitration  and thus the Courts  at Delhi  have  the jurisdiction  to 
entertain  all proceedings  under  the Arbitration  Act.  
53. Reference  may be had to the Judgment  of the Supreme  Court  in 
S.N. Prasad  v. Monnet  Finance  Ltd., (2011)  1 SCC 320wherein  the 
Supreme  Court  has held thatthe words,  “statements  of claim  and 
defence”  occurring  in Section  7(4)(c)  of the Act, are not restricted  to 
the statements  of claim  and defence  filed before  the arbitrator.  If there  
is an assertion  of existence  of an arbitration  agreement  in any suit, 
petition  or application  filed before  any court,  and if there  is no denial  
thereof  in the defence/counter/written  statement  thereto  filed by the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  35 of 40 
 
other  party  to such suit, petition  or application,  then it can be said 
that there  is an “exchange  of statements  of claim  and defence”  for the 
purposes  of Section  7(4)(c)  of the Act. It follows  that if in the 
application  filed under  Section  11 of the Act, the applicant  asserts  the 
existence  of an arbitration  agreement  with each  of the respondents  
and if the respondents  do not deny  the said assertion,  in their  
state ment  of defence,  the court  can proceed  on the basis  that there  is 
an arbitration  agreement  in writing  between  the parties.  
54. In K.P. Ranga  Rao v. K.V. Venkatesham,  (2015)  13 SCC 514the 
Supreme  Court  referring  to Section  21 of the Code  of Civil  Procedure  
and the judgment  in Pathumma  v. KuntalanKutty  (1981)  3 SCC 
589held that Pathumma  (supra) really  concludes  the matter  and in 
order  that an objection  to the place  of suing  may be entertained  by an 
appellate  or revisional  court,  the fulfilment  of the following  three 
conditions  is essential:(1)  The objection  was taken  in the court  of first 
instance;  (2) It was taken  at the earliest  possible  opportunity  and in 
cases  where  issues  are settle d, at or before  such settlement  and (3) 
There  has been  a consequent  failure  of justice.  The Supreme  Court  
held that all these  three  conditions  must  coexist.  
55. The Supreme  Court  further  held that the appellate  court  or 
revisional  court  shall  not allow  an objection  to the place  of suing    
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  36 of 40 
 
unless  such objection  was taken  in the court  of first instance  at the 
earliest  possible  opportunity  and in all cases  where  issues  are settled  
at or before  such settlement.  What  follows  is important.  An objection  
as to place  of suing  cannot  be allowed  unless  there  has been  a 
consequent  failure  of justice . 
56. As noticed  above,  the assertion  of the Appellants  of the Delhi  
Courts  having  jurisdiction  has not been  denied  before  the learned  
Single  Judge  and as such the Respondents  are precluded  from  raising  
the same  in Appeal.  
57. Even,  if the objection  of jurisdictio n could  be raised  before  the 
Appellate  Court,  since  the Venue  has been  held to be the Juridical  
Seat of Arbitration  in terms  of the Arbitration  Agreement  Clause  23, 
the Courts  at Delhi  had the territorial  jurisdiction  to entertain  the 
Petition  under  sectio n 9 of the Arbitration  Act. Clause  23 expressly  
designates  Delhi  at the Venue  for arbitration  and there  is no 
designation  of an alternative  place  as the „Seat‟,  the inexorable  
conclusion  is that the stated  Venue  i.e. Delhi  is the juridical  seat of the 
arbitral  proceedings.  Clause  19 would  be relevant  only if by an 
agreement  both parties  decided  not to settle  their disputes  through  
arbitration  but by approaching  a Cour t of law, in which  case the 
exclusive  jurisdiction  would  be of the Courts  at Gurugram,  Haryana.    
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  37 of 40 
 
58. Reliance  placed  by learned  senior  counsel  for the respondent  on 
Enercon  (India)  Ltd. vs Enercon  GmbH  [Enercon  (India)  Ltd. v. 
Enercon  GmbH  (2014)  5 SCC 1is misplaced.  In the said case,  the 
Supreme  Court  found  that the seat of arbitration  was fixed  in India  but 
the venue  was in London.   The Supreme  Court  held that as the parties  
had agreed  that the governing  law would  be the law of India  and the 
Provision  of Indian Arbitration  and conciliation  Act, 1996  was to 
apply , the seat was fixed  in India.   In the present  case there  is no 
separate stipulation  which  could  fix the seat for the purposes  of 
arbitration  Act at a place  different  from  the venue . As held 
hereinabove  the Venue  being  Delhi  also fixed  the seat for the 
purposes  of Arbitration  at Delhi.  
59. Further,  reliance  placed  on the judgment  in Mankatsu  Impex  
Private  Limited  vs. Airvisual  Limited  (2020)  5 SCC 399is also 
misplaced . Rather  the said judgment  supports  the case of the 
Appellants.  In the said case,  the contract  stipulated  that the MoU  was 
governed  by laws of India and courts  at New  Delhi  shall  have  the 
jurisdiction  but with regard  to arbitration  it stipulated  that any dispute  
shall  be referred  to and finally  resolved  by arbitration  administered  in 
Hong Kong  and the place  of arbitration  shall  be Hong Kong. The 
Supreme  Court  held that reference  to Hong  Kong  as “place  of  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  38 of 40 
 
arbitration”  is not a simple  reference  as the “venue”  for the arbitral  
proceedings;  but a reference  to Hong  Kong  was for final resolution  by 
arbitration  administered  in Hong  Kong.  The words  “arbitration  
administered  in Hong  Kong”  is indicia  that the seat of arbitration  is at 
Hong  Kong.  Once  parties  had chose n “Hong  Kong”  as the place  of 
arbitration  to be administered  in Hong  Kong,  the laws of Hong  Kong  
would  govern  the arbitration.  The Indian  courts  have  no jurisdiction  
for appointment  of the arbitrator.  
60. The judgment  in Kush  Raj Bhatia  vs. DLF Power  and Services  
Limited  2022  SCC OnLine  Del 3309 is not applicable  to the facts  of 
the present  case for the reason  that in the said case,  the same  clause  
stipulated  that the place  of holding  arbitration  proceedings  and that the 
civil courts  at Gurga on and High Court  at Chandigarh  alone  shall  have 
jurisdiction.  The court  thus held the seat to be in Gurgaon.   
61. Meenakshi  Nehra  Bhat  and Another  vs Wave  Megacity  Private  
Limited  2022  SCC Online  Del 3744does not further  the case of the 
Respondent  for the reason that the arbitration  clause  in that case 
stipulated  that the “Arbitration  Proceedings  shall  be held at New  Delhi  
and the courts  at Gautam  Budh  Nagar,  Uttar  Pradesh  shall  to the 
exclusion  of all other  courts,  alone  have  the exclusive  jurisdiction  in 
all matters  arising  out of/or  concerning  the Application  Form/this   
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  39 of 40 
 
Arrangement,  regardless  of the place  of execution  of this 
Arrangement.  This will be without  prejudice  to the territorial  and 
statutory  jurisdiction  of Allahabad  High  Court. ” The stipulation  that 
the Courts  at Gautam  Budh  Nagar,  Uttar  Pradesh  shall  have  exclusive  
jurisdiction  was also part of the Arbitration  Clause  unlike  the present  
case where  the clauses  are different  and the Arbitration  Clause  not 
containing  a contradictory  stipulation.   
62. Reliance placed  by learn ed counsel  for the respondent  on the 
judgment  in the case of BBR (India)  Private  Limited  vs. S.P. Singla  
Constructions  Private  limited  (2023)  1 SCC 693 does not further  the 
case of the Respondent  for the reason  that the issue  in the said case 
was as to whether  conducting  arbitration  proceedings  at Delhi  owing  
to appointment  of a new arbitrator  would  shift the jurisdictional  seat 
of arbitration  from  Punchkula  in Harya na, the place  fixed  by the first 
arbitrator  for the arbitration  proceedi ngs. The court  noticed  that the 
Arbitral  Tribunal  had fixed  the seat at Panchkula  and thus by mere  
change  of arbitrator  and holding  subsequent  sittings  at New  Delhi  and 
publishing  of the award  in Delhi  would  not change  the seat of 
arbitration,  where  it was initially  fixed  in Panchkula  to Delhi.   
63. In view  of the above,  the objection  of territorial  jurisdiction  
raised  by the Respondents  is accordingly  decided  in favour  of the  
 
 
FAO  (OS)  (COMM)  48/202 3 Page  40 of 40 
 
Appellant  and against  the Respo ndents.  It is held that clause  23 of the 
Collaboration  Agreement  providing  for Venue  of Arbitration  at Delhi  
is indicative  of the fact that the arbitral  proceedings  are intended  to be 
anchored  to Delhi  and Delhi  being  the Seat of Arbitration ,the Courts  
at Delhi would  have  the territorial  jurisdiction  to entertain  all 
proceedings  under  the Arbitration  Act pertaining  to disputes  and 
differences  arising  out of or in connection  with the interpretation  or 
implementation  of the Collaboration  Agreement,  or out of or in 
connection  with the breach,  or alleged  breach  of the Collaboration  
Agreement.

HONBLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV SACHDEVA
HONBLE MR. JUSTICE MANOJ JAIN
JUDGMENT
SANJEEVSACHDEVA, J.
1. Appellant impugns order dated 14.03.2023 (hereinafter referred to as Impugned order), whereby the Learned Single Judge dismissed the petition under Section 9 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1966 (hereinafter referred to as the Arbitration Act) seeking to restrain the Respondents from selling, alienating or transferring the land subject matter of a Collaboration Agreement dated 15.05.2018, entered into between Appellant and Respondent No.1.
2. Appellant, a limited liability Partnership, of which Respondent No. 2 is the erstwhile partner entered into a Collaboration Agreement on 15.05.2018 with Respondent No. 1 the owner of the land admeasuring 94 Kanal & 7 Marla, or11.79375 acres, situated in the Revenue Estate of Village Dhunela, Tehsil Sohna, Gurugram, Haryana-122001 for the purposes of the development of the said land (hereinafter referred to as the Collaboration Property).
3. As per the Appellant, under the Collaboration Agreement, Appellant was to develop the Collaboration Property at its own cost and was entitled to sell the developed land. A portion of the developed land was earmarked as consideration for the Respondent No.1. Besides the said earmarked portion, a sum of Rs. 4.21 Cr. was paid to Respondent No. 1. 
4. As per the Appellant, Respondent No. 1 in collusion with Respondent No. 2, the erstwhile partner illegally terminated the Collaboration Agreement and was seeking to alienate and sell the Collaboration Property. 
5. For seeking interim measures of protection, Appellant filed the subject petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration Actinter aliaseeking a direction to the Respondent No. 1, to maintain status quo qua possession and title of the Collaboration Property and further to restrain them from directly or indirectly, selling, transferring, alienating or creating any third party rights therein.
6. By an interim order dated 23.12.2022, the learned Single Judge directed maintenance of status quo with regard to title and possession of the subject property.
7. However, by the impugned order dated 14.03.2023, learned Single Judge has dismissed the Petition filed seeking interim measures of protection under section 9 of the Act, holding that, as the Collaboration Agreement between the parties already stands terminated, there was an impossibility for this Court to direct its specific performance in a proceedings under Section 9 of the Act. 
8. Aggrieved by the said decision, Appellants have filed the subject appeal under Section 37 of the Act. 
9. At the outset a preliminary objection has been raised by the Respondents about the lack of territorial jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi to entertain the proceedings under the Act. 
10. It is contended by the Respondents, that the Collaboration property is situated in Sohna, Haryana, the Collaboration Agreement dated 15.05.2018 was executed in Sohna, Haryana containing an exclusive jurisdiction clause stipulating all disputes to be subject to jurisdiction of courts at Gurugram/Haryana alone, the courts at Delhi would have no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings under the Act.
11. Per contra, as per the Appellants, the Collaboration Agreement contains an Arbitration Clause conferring jurisdiction to the courts at Delhi and as such the courts at Delhi would have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings under the Act.
12. It would be expedient to refer to the respective clauses in the Collaboration Agreement dated 15.05.2018 entered into between Appellant and Respondent No. 1. The respective Clause 19 and 23  read as under:
19.	Jurisdiction 
19.1 	All matters concerning these presents and the development of the schedule property shall be subject to the jurisdiction of courts at Gurugram/Haryana alone.
     23.	Arbitration
23.1. 	In the event any dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, or out of or in connection with the breach, or alleged breach of this Agreement, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to be decided by a sole Arbitrator appointed mutually by the Parties hereto. In case of any difference between the parties on appointment of a sole Arbitrator, the arbitration tribunal shall consist of three Arbitrators. The SECOND PARTY shall appoint one Arbitrator and the FIRST PARTY shall appoint the second Arbitrator. The third Arbitrator shall be appointed by the two selected Arbitrators failing which such appointment shall be done by the Arbitration Council of India, New Delhi. The decision taken by the majority of Arbitrators shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto. The venue of the Arbitration shall be at Delhi, India.
23.1.1. All proceedings in any such Arbitration shall be conducted in English.
23.1.2.Each Party agrees to bear its own costs of Arbitration.
23.1.3. The Arbitration award made by the Arbitrators shall be Final and binding on the Parties and the Parties agree to be bound thereby and to act accordingly.
23.1.4. The award shall be in writing.
23.1.5. The provisions of this Clause shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

13. It may be noticed that clause 19 of the Collaboration Agreement stipulates that all matters concerning the Collaboration Agreement and the development of the scheduled property have been made subject to the courts at Gurugram/ Haryana alone. 
14. On the other hand clause 23of the Collaboration Agreement provides for Arbitration between the parties and stipulates that the venue of Arbitration shall be at Delhi, India. 
15. Mr. Amit Sibal, the Learned Senior Counsel on behalf of the Appellant submits that the usage of the expression venue in the arbitration clause by the parties was intended to be Seat for arbitration, and not mere convenient place. Thus, the parties were ad idem on New Delhi being the Seat of Arbitration. 
16. He further submits that in the petition filed under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, Appellant had specifically stated that the venue of arbitration was New Delhi and that no other Seat of Arbitration was provided under the Collaboration Agreement. He submitted that the issue of jurisdiction was not raised before the learned single judge and had been raised for the first time in the appeal. He submits that the Respondents by their conduct of not objecting to the Jurisdiction before the learned single judge even in their reply have accepted the jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi and as such are precluded from raising the same at this belated stage.
17. Learned senior counsel submits that in the interpretation of any agreement, the subsequent conduct of party is a relevant factor.He submits that even though the parties have intended New Delhi to only be venue, but through their subsequent conduct i.e. exchange of pleadings in terms of Section 7(4)(c) of the Act they have impliedly agreed to arbitrate with New Delhi being the Seat of Arbitration. 
18. He further submits that in view of the Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, since the Respondents did not object to jurisdiction before the Learned Single Judgeraising of objection in the present appeal is only an afterthought and lacks ofbona fidesand cannot be permitted to be raised. 
19. Learned seniorcounsel appearing for the Respondent submits that the appeal is not maintainable, in the backdrop of the Collaboration Agreement, which contains a jurisdiction clause and arbitration clause.  He submits that upon bare perusal of Clause 19.1 it is evident that the Collaboration Agreement vests jurisdiction exclusively with courts of Gurugram/Haryana ousting the jurisdiction of other courts. The usage of word alone in the said clause makes it abundantly clear that the intention of parties was to confer exclusive jurisdiction upon the courts of Gurugram/Haryana only. 
20. He further submits that the opening line of Clause 19.1 i.e., All matters concerning these presents and the developments of the scheduled property itself suggests that the said clause is exhaustive in nature covering all aspects of the collaboration agreement. Moreover, the rationale to interpret the phrase all matters in the context encompasses all disputes, differences etc. arising in relation to the Agreement and will include arbitrable disputes also. 
21. He further submits that Clause 23 pertaining to Arbitration refers only to the venue and not the seat and cannot be read as the seat in view of the exception carved out by the Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC Ltd. (2020) 4 SCC 234.
22. He submits that the Arbitration Clause contained in the Agreement deliberately used the word venue and not seat thereby substantiating the intention of the parties that only the geographical location of the arbitration proceedings/meetings will be at Delhi and the word venue used in Clause 23.1 could not be interpreted as Seat of Arbitration as Delhi.
23. Learned Senior counsel for the Respondent further submits that reliance on Section 7(4)(c) of the Arbitration Act is misplaced as there is no alleged written Arbitration Agreement contained in the pleadings which have been exchanged between the parties. Therefore, the Collaboration Agreement, in whole remains undisputed till date and the arbitration agreement in question is clearly contained in the said Collaboration Agreement and not the pleadings.
24. He further submits that the issue of territorial jurisdiction, is a pure question of law and could be raised at any stage of the proceedings and the bar of Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure, could not be applied.
25. Reference may be had to the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in BGS SGS Soma JV v. NHPC Ltd., (2020) 4 SCC 234wherein it is held as under:
38. 	A reading of paras 75, 76, 96, 110, 116, 123 and 194 of Balco [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] would show that where parties have selected the seat of arbitration in their agreement, such selection would then amount to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, as the parties have now indicated that the courts at the seat would alone have jurisdiction to entertain challenges against the arbitral award which have been made at the seat. The example given in para 96 buttresses this proposition, and is supported by the previous and subsequent paragraphs pointed out hereinabove. The Balco [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] judgment, when read as a whole, applies the concept of seat as laid down by the English judgments (and which is in Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1996), by harmoniously construing Section 20 with Section 2(1)(e), so as to broaden the definition of court, and bring within its ken courts of the seat of the arbitration.
*****			*****			*****
40. 	Para 96 of Balco case [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] is in several parts. First and foremost, Section 2(1)(e), which is the definition of court under the Arbitration Act, 1996 was referred to, and was construed keeping in view the provisions in Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which give recognition to party autonomy in choosing the seat of the arbitration proceedings. Secondly, the Court went on to state in two places in the said paragraph that jurisdiction is given to two sets of courts, namely, those courts which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located; and those courts where the arbitration takes place. However, when it came to providing a neutral place as the seat of arbitration proceedings, the example given by the five-Judge Bench made it clear that appeals under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 against interim orders passed under Section 17 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 would lie only to the courts of the seat  which is Delhi in that example  which are the courts having supervisory control, or jurisdiction, over the arbitration proceedings. The example then goes on to state that this would be irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed under the contract, that is the cause of action, may arise in part either at Mumbai or Kolkata. The fact that the arbitration is to take place in Delhi is of importance. However, the next sentence in the said paragraph reiterates the concurrent jurisdiction of both courts.
*****			*****			*****
49. 	Take the consequence of the opposite conclusion, in the light of the facts of a given example, as follows. New Delhi is specifically designated to be the seat of the arbitration in the arbitration clause between the parties. Part of the cause of action, however, arises in several places, including where the contract is partially to be performed, let us say, in a remote part of Uttarakhand. If concurrent jurisdiction were to be the order of the day, despite the seat having been located and specifically chosen by the parties, party autonomy would suffer, which Balco [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] specifically states cannot be the case. Thus, if an application is made to a District Court in a remote corner of the Uttarakhand hills, which then becomes the court for the purposes of Section 42 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 where even Section 34 applications have then to be made, the result would be contrary to the stated intention of the parties  as even though the parties have contemplated that a neutral place be chosen as the seat so that the courts of that place alone would have jurisdiction, yet, any one of five other courts in which a part of the cause of action arises, including courts in remote corners of the country, would also be clothed with jurisdiction. This obviously cannot be the case. If, therefore, the conflicting portion of the judgment of Balco [Balco v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc., (2012) 9 SCC 552 : (2012) 4 SCC (Civ) 810] in para 96 is kept aside for a moment, the very fact that parties have chosen a place to be the seat would necessarily carry with it the decision of both parties that the courts at the seat would exclusively have jurisdiction over the entire arbitral process.
50. 	In fact, subsequent Division Benches of this Court have understood the law to be that once the seat of arbitration is chosen, it amounts to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, insofar as the courts at that seat are concerned. In Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , this Court approved the dictum in Shashoua [Shashoua v. Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm) : (2009) 2 Lloyd's Law Rep 376] as follows : (Enercon case [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH, (2014) 5 SCC 1 : (2014) 3 SCC (Civ) 59] , SCC p. 55, para 126)
126. Examining the fact situation in the case, the Court in Shashoua case [Shashoua v. Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm) : (2009) 2 Lloyd's Law Rep 376] observed as follows:
The basis for the court's grant of an anti-suit injunction of the kind sought depended upon the seat of the arbitration. An agreement as to the seat of an arbitration brought in the law of that country as the curial law and was analogous to an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Not only was there agreement to the curial law of the seat, but also to the courts of the seat having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, so that, by agreeing to the seat, the parties agreed that any challenge to an interim or final award was to be made only in the courts of the place designated as the seat of the arbitration.
Although, venue was not synonymous with seat, in an arbitration clause which provided for arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the Rules of the ICC in Paris (a supranational body of rules), a provision that the venue of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom did amount to the designation of a juridical seat.
*****			*****			*****
Tests for determination of seat
60. 	The judgments of the English courts have examined the concept of the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings, and have laid down several important tests in order to determine whether the seat of the arbitral proceedings has, in fact, been indicated in the agreement between the parties. The judgment of Cooke, J., in Shashoua [Shashoua v. Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm) : (2009) 2 Lloyd's Law Rep 376] , states:
34. London arbitration is a well-known phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign nationals with a different law, such as the law of New York, governing the substantive rights of the parties. This is because of the legislative framework and supervisory powers of the courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. When therefore there is an express designation of the arbitration venue as London and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is, to my mind, that London is the juridical seat and English Law the curial law. In my judgment it is clear that either London has been designated by the parties to the arbitration agreement as the seat of the arbitration, or, having regard to the parties' agreement and all the relevant circumstances, it is the seat to be determined in accordance with the final fall back provision of Section 3 of the Arbitration Act.
61. 	It will thus be seen that wherever there is an express designation of a venue, and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding.
62. 	In Enercon GmbH v. Enercon (India) Ltd. [Enercon GmbH v. Enercon (India) Ltd., 2012 EWHC 689 (Comm) : (2012) 1 Lloyd's Rep 519] , the arbitration clause between the parties read as follows:
18.3. All proceedings in such arbitration shall be conducted in English. The venue of the arbitration proceedings shall be London. The arbitrators may (but shall not be obliged to) award costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) to the party(ies) that substantially prevail on merit. The provisions of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall apply.
63. 	The Court in Enercon GmbH [Enercon GmbH v. Enercon (India) Ltd., 2012 EWHC 689 (Comm) : (2012) 1 Lloyd's Rep 519] began its discussion on the seat of the arbitration by referring to Shashoua [Shashoua v. Sharma, 2009 EWHC 957 (Comm) : (2009) 2 Lloyd's Law Rep 376] , and then referring to The Conflict of Laws, Dicey, Morris & Collins, 14th Edn. as follows:
58. Moreover, as Cooke, J. noted, this conclusion is consistent with the views expressed in The Conflict of Laws, Dicey, Morris & Collins, 14thEdition at 16-035 where the authors state that the seat is in most cases sufficiently indicated by the country chosen as the place of the arbitration. For such a choice of place not to be given effect as a choice of seat, there will need to be clear evidence that the parties  agreed to choose another seat for the arbitration and that such a choice will be effective to endow the courts of that country with jurisdiction to supervise and support the arbitration.
59. 	Apart from the last sentence in Clause 18.3 (i.e. The provisions of the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall apply), it seems to me that the conclusion that London is the seat of any arbitration there-under is beyond any possible doubt. Thus, the main issue is whether this last sentence is to be regarded as significant contrary indicia (using the language of Cooke, J.) so as to place the seat of the arbitration in India. A similar issue was considered by Saville, J. in Union of India v. McDonnell Douglas [Union of India v. McDonnell Douglas Corpn., (1993) 2 Lloyd's Rep 48] which, of course, pre-dates the English 1996 Act. The arbitration agreement in that case provided as follows:In the event of a dispute arising out of or in connection with this agreementthe same shall be referred to an Arbitration TribunalThe arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure provided in the Indian Arbitration Act of 1940 or any enactment or modification thereof. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English languageThe seat of the arbitration proceedings shall be London, United Kingdom. Saville, J. expressed the view that the arguments on both sides were finely balanced but in effect concluded that the reference to the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 did not have the effect of changing the seat of the arbitration designated by the parties. Rather, the phrase referring to the 1940 Act was to be reconciled with the rest of the clause by reading it as referring to the internal conduct of the arbitration as opposed to the external supervision of the arbitration by the courts.
64. 	The Court in Enercon GmbH [Enercon GmbH v. Enercon (India) Ltd., 2012 EWHC 689 (Comm) : (2012) 1 Lloyd's Rep 519] then held that although the word venue is not synonymous with seat, on the facts of that case, London  though described as the venue  was really the seat of the arbitration. This was for the reason that London was a neutral place in which neither party worked for gain, and in which no part of the cause of action arose. It was thus understood to be a neutral place in which the proceedings could be anchored. Secondly, the Court stressed on the expression arbitration proceedings in Clause 18.3, which the Court held to be an expression which included not just one or more individual hearings, but the arbitral proceedings as a whole, culminating in the making of an award. The Court held:
63. 	Second, the language in Clause 18.3 refers to the arbitration proceedings. That is an expression which includes not just one or more individual or particular hearings but the arbitration proceedings as a whole including the making of an award. In other words the parties were anchoring the whole arbitration process in London right up to and including the making of an award. The place designated for the making of an award is a designation of seat. Moreover the language in Clause 18.3 does not refer to the venue of all hearings taking place in London. Clause 18.3 instead provides that the venue of the arbitration proceedings shall be London. This again suggests the parties intended to anchor the arbitration proceedings to and in London rather than simply physically locating the arbitration hearings in London. Indeed in a case where evidence might need to be taken or perhaps more likely inspected in India it would make no commercial sense to construe the provision as mandating all hearings to take place in a physical place as opposed to anchoring the arbitral process to and in a designated place. All agreements including an arbitration agreement should be construed to accord with business common sense. In my view, there is no business common sense to construe the arbitration agreement (as contended for by EIL) in a manner which would simply deprive the arbitrators of an important discretion that they possess to hear evidence in a convenient geographical location.
64. Third, Joseph QC submitted that the last sentence of Clause 18.3 can be reconciled with the choice of London as the seat. First, he submitted that it can be read as referring simply to Part II of the Indian 1996 Act i.e. the enforcement provisions. Edey QC's response was that if that is all the last sentence meant, then it would be superfluous. However, I do not consider that any such superfluity carries much, if any, weight. Alternatively, Joseph QC submitted that it can be read as referring only to those provisions of the Indian 1996 Act which were not inconsistent with the English 1996 Act.
*****			*****			*****
82. 	On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may be concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. This language has to be contrasted with language such as tribunals are to meet or have witnesses, experts or the parties where only hearings are to take place in the venue, which may lead to the conclusion, other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the seat of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings. In an international context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia that the venue, so stated, would be the seat of the arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would be replaced by the Arbitration Act, 1996 as applying to the stated venue, which then becomes the seat for the purposes of arbitration.
(underlining supplied)

26. The Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV, referring to Balco (supra), held that where parties had selected the Seat of Arbitration in their agreement, such selection would amount to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, as the parties had indicated that the courts at the seat would alone have jurisdiction to entertain challenges against the arbitral award which have been made at the seat. Further, if jurisdiction is given to two sets of courts, namely, those courts which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is located; and those courts where the arbitration takes place all proceedings would lie only to the courts of the Seat which are the courts having supervisory control, or jurisdiction, over the arbitration proceedings.It held that if concurrent jurisdiction were to be the order of the day, despite the seat having been located and specifically chosen by the parties, party autonomy would suffer, which as per the Supreme Court Balco (supra) specifically stated could not be the case.
27. The Supreme Court further held that the very fact that parties had chosen a place to be the seat would necessarily carry with it the decision of both parties that the courts at the seat would exclusively have jurisdiction over the entire arbitral process. Once the seat of arbitration is chosen, it amounted to an exclusive jurisdiction clause, insofar as the courts at that seat are concerned.
28. Referring to Shashoua v. Sharma (supra), the Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) held that not only was there agreement to the curial law of the seat, but also to the courts of the seat having supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration, so that, by agreeing to the seat, the parties agreed that any challenge to an interim or final award was to be made only in the courts of the place designated as the seat of the arbitration. It further held that although, venue was not synonymous with seat, in an arbitration clause which provided for arbitration to be conducted in accordance with the Rules of the ICC in Paris (a supranational body of rules), a provision that the venue of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom did amount to the designation of a juridical seat.. 
29. The Supreme Court held that the judgments of the English courts had examined the concept of the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings, and laid down several important tests in order to determine whether the seat of the arbitral proceedings has, in fact, been indicated in the agreement between the parties. 
30. Referring to Shashoua v. Sharma (supra) it was held that wherever there is an express designation of a venue, and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, combined with a supranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding.
31. The Supreme Court also referred to the Conflict of Laws, Dicey, Morris & Collins, 14th Edition at 16-035 and noted that seat was in most cases was sufficiently indicated by the country chosen as the place of the arbitration. For such a choice of place not to be given effect as a choice of seat, there would need to be clear evidence that the parties agreed to choose another seat for the arbitration.
32. The Supreme Court referred to Enercon GmbH (supra) and noted that the Court had held that although the word venue was not synonymous with seat, on the facts of that case, London  though described as the venue  was really the seat of the arbitration. This was for the reason that London was a neutral place in which neither party worked for gain, and in which no part of the cause of action arose.
33. It noted that parties were anchoring the whole arbitration process in London right up to and including the making of an award and held that the place designated for the making of an award is a designation of seat. It held that the language in Clause 18.3 did not refer to the venue of all hearings taking place in London instead provided that the venue of the arbitration proceedings shall be London. This suggested that the parties intended to anchor the arbitration proceedings to and in London rather than simply physically locating the arbitration hearings in London. 
34. After considering various Indian and English Judgments, the Supreme Court concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings.
35. Similar view has been expressed by several judicial pronouncements rendered by learned single judges of this court.  Reference may be had to some of such judgements. 
36. In Dholi Spintex Pvt. Ltd. vs. Louis Dreyfus Company Pvt. Ltd., 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1476considering the term Venue used in clause 6 of the agreement learned single judge held that by agreeing to conduct the arbitration through International Cotton Association (ICA for short), parties had agreed that the seat of arbitration would be London and not Delhi even though by Clause 7 the Substantive Law of the contract was Indian Law and parties had agreed to exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts at Delhi. It was held that per clause 6, parties had specifically agreed that any dispute arising out of the contract shall be resolved through arbitration in accordance with International Cotton Association Rules and arbitration procedure, the parties had thus agreed to abide by the rules and byelaws of the ICA which provided that the seat of arbitration is in London and the law of England and Wales shall apply to every arbitration and/or appeal under these byelaws. The Court held that Clause 7 entered into between the parties would be relevant if by an agreement both parties decide not to settle their disputes through arbitration but by approaching the Court of law, in which case the exclusive jurisdiction would be of the Courts at New Delhi.
37. In M/s Cable Corporation of India Ltd. v. M/s Jay Pee Sports International Ltd., 2018 SCC OnLine Del 10340where the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Clause stipulated the Venue of Arbitration as New Delhi but the Governing Laws and Jurisdictionclause stipulating that the district Courts of Gautam Budh Nagar and High Court of Judicature at Allahabad shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of or related to this Contract, a learned single judge of this court referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt. Ltd. v. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. (2017) 7 SCC 678 and Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon Gmbh, (2014) 5 SCC 1 and noted that like in the present case, the Arbitration Clause was distinct from the JurisdictionClause and noted that the arbitration clause in that case was Clause 31 with the heading Disputes Resolution and Arbitration. Clause 31.2 clearly stipulated that the venue of arbitration shall be New Delhi. Clause 38 had a heading Governing Laws and Jurisdiction. It was not dealing with arbitration. Clause 31 was a provision dealing only in arbitration and would apply in relation to arbitration proceedings. As the arbitration proceedings are to be held in Delhi, the courts in Delhi would exercise jurisdiction over the arbitration process and the seat of arbitration would be Delhi. Clause 38 being a general provision would be applicable to proceedings that may take placeother than the arbitration proceedings. This would be the appropriate harmonious interpretation of the two clauses of the agreement between the parties.
38. In Gauri Dwivedi v. Director News Pvt. Ltd. 2023 SCC OnLine Del 2367the learned single judge held that the Juridical or legal seat of arbitration once designated or determined exclusively determines which courts will have jurisdiction over the arbitration, as opposed to the place where whole or part of the cause of action arises. Thus, once the seat of arbitration is designated or determined, the same operates as an exclusive jurisdiction clause as a result of which only the courts where the seat is located would have jurisdiction over the arbitration, to the exclusion of all other courts, even courts where part of the cause of action may have arisen. The Test for determination of juridical seat wherever there is an express designation of a venue, and no designation of any alternative place as the seat is the Shashoua principle which states that wherever there is an express designation of a venue, and no designation of any alternative place as the seat, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical seat of the arbitral proceeding, to the exclusion of all other courts, even courts where part of the cause of action may have arisen.
39. The learned Judge further held that whenever there is the designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the venue of the arbitration proceedings, the expression arbitration proceedings would make it clear that the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceedings, as arbitration proceedings does not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the arbitrationproceedings as a whole, including the making of an award at that place. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings shall be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties intend to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a venue and not the seat of the arbitral proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a clause designates a seat of the arbitral proceedings, to the exclusion of all other courts, even courts where part of the cause of action may have arisen.
40. Similar view if expressed in Cinepolis India Pvt. Ltd. v. Celebration City Projects Pvt. Ltd. 2020 SCC Online Del 301wherein the court referring to the clauses of the agreement noted that parties by agreement had conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the subject matter of the agreement on the courts in Ghaziabad, while the place of the arbitration was New Delhi. Learned judge held that while it was true that the arbitration clause did not specifically use the word seat but it was no longer res integra that the term place would be the juridical seat for the purpose of Section 2(2) of the Act and the word place was equivalent to venue. 
41. In Raman Deep Singh Taneja v. Crown Realtech Private Limited 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11966, referring to Balco (Supra), it was held that a distinction is to be drawn between Subject-Matter of the Arbitration and Subject-Matter of the Suit. For the purposes of identifying the Court, which shall have supervisory control over the arbitral proceedings, it would be the Court where the Subject-Matter of Arbitration is situated that would have precedence over the Court where the Subject-Matter of the Suit is situated. Therefore, the exclusivejurisdiction conferred due to venue of arbitration would take precedence over the exclusive jurisdiction vested over the Subject-Matter of the suit and the Court having jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings would have precedence over the Court which has jurisdiction over the Subject-Matter of the suit or where the cause of action has arisen. The court held that the purported conflict between the two parts could be resolved by holding that where the disputes are to be adjudicated without reference to the arbitration, Courts at Delhi would have exclusive jurisdiction, however, where they have to be resolved through arbitration, venue being at Faridabad, Haryana, the Courts at Faridabad, State of Haryana, would have exclusive jurisdiction.
42. In Reliance Infrastructure Limited v. Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Del 4894, another learned single judge of this court referring to several judgments held that the choice of Delhi as the venue of arbitration was demonstrative of the fact that the arbitral proceedings were intended to be anchored to Delhi, and in the absence of any contrary indicia, the inexorable conclusion was that Delhi is the seat of Arbitration.It was further held that when the contract contains an arbitration clause that specifies a venue, thereby anchoring the arbitral proceedings thereto, then the said venue is really the seat of arbitration. In such a situation the courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the said seat shall exercise supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitral process, notwithstanding that the contract contains a clause seeking to confer exclusive jurisdiction on a different court. Further, that a generic clause, not specifically referring to arbitration proceedings would not serve as a contrary indicia so as to denude the jurisdiction of the Courts having jurisdiction over the seat of Arbitration.
43. Coming back to the facts of the present case, reference has been made by the parties to two different clauses of the Collaboration Agreement. One is clause 19 (Jurisdiction) which stipulates that all matters concerning the agreement and the development of the schedule property shall be subject to the jurisdiction of courts at Gurugram Haryana alone. The other being clause 23 (Arbitration) stipulating that In the event any dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, or out of or in connection with the breach, or alleged breach of this Agreement, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to be decided by a sole Arbitrator appointed mutually by the Parties hereto. In case of any difference between the parties on appointment of a sole Arbitrator, the arbitration tribunal shall consist of three Arbitrators. The SECOND PARTY shall appoint one Arbitrator and the FIRST PARTY shall appoint the second Arbitrator. The third Arbitrator shall be appointed by the two selected Arbitrators failing which such appointment shall be done by the Arbitration Council of India, New Delhi. The decision taken by the majority of Arbitrators shall be final and binding on the Parties hereto. The venue of the Arbitration shall be at Delhi, India
44. Clause 23 is the Arbitration clause and it is distinct from clause 19. The Arbitration contract is contained in Clause 23 and it is a complete contract between the parties relating to arbitration. When clause 23 is read, it clearly establishes that the parties agreed that the Venue of the entire Arbitration proceedings would be Delhi, India. Even in case of a disagreement between the two selected arbitrators, the appointment of the third arbitrator is to be done by the Arbitration Council of India, New Delhi  Clause 23.1.5, which is under the main Clause 23 pertaining to Arbitration stipulates that the provisions of the Clause shall survive the termination of the Agreement. This clearly shows that Clause 23 pertaining to Arbitration is distinct from the Collaboration Agreement and is to survive even the termination of the Agreement. 
45. Clause 23 provides for Venue of the Arbitration and thus in terms of the Judgment of the Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) and Balco (Supra) would amount to the Juridical Seat of Arbitration and thus the courts at Delhi would have the exclusive jurisdiction over the entire arbitral process. The Arbitration clause provides that all dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, or out of or in connection with the breach, or alleged breach of this Agreement are to be settled through Arbitration. There are no contra indicia in the instant case to indicate otherwise.
46. On the other hand Clause 19 provides that all matters concerning these presents and the development of the schedule property shall be subject to the jurisdiction of courts at Gurugram/Haryana. 
47. Arbitration is stipulated by Clause 23 which is distinct from Clause 19 providing for jurisdiction. Clause 19 being a general provision would be applicable to proceedings that may take place, other than arbitration proceedings and would cover all matters that are not subject matter of arbitration.
48. Accordingly, the Courts at Delhi would have the exclusive jurisdiction to entertain all proceedings covered by Clause 23 i.e. the Arbitration Clause. 
49. Looked at from another angle, it may be noted that Respondent did not object to the assertion of the Appellant, that the Venue agreed between the Parties being Delhi, the Courts at Delhi would have the territorial jurisdiction. 
50. Appellants in their Petition under section 9 of the Act stated as under:
55. The Petitioner submits that this Hon'ble Court has the territorial jurisdiction to try and entertain the present Petition inasmuch as the venue of arbitration under Clause 23.1 of the Collaboration Agreement is New Delhi and therefore this Hon'ble Court is exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration proceedings to be initiated. The Petitioner submits that the Collaboration Agreement does not provide for any other ""seat"" of arbitration and also provides that the arbitrator shall be appointed by the Arbitration Council of India, New Delhi in the event of failure of any of the Parties to appoint an arbitrator. Accordingly, New Delhi is deemed to be the seat of arbitration and in view of the Judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in BGS SGS Soma JV vs. NHPC (2020) 4 SCC 234, the Courts at New Delhi have the exclusive jurisdiction to deal in respect of any matters arising out of the arbitration clause. The Petitioner submits that Clause 19 of the Collaboration Agreement providing for jurisdiction of Courts at Gurugram is irrelevant and would only apply in relation to matters outside of the Arbitration Agreement.
51. In the reply filed by the respondent No. 1 on 23.01.2013 before the learned single judge no denial was made to the above assertion by the Appellant. Similarly, in the reply filed by Respondent No. 2 on 30.01.2023 before the learned single judge no denial was made to the above assertion by the Appellant, about the territorial jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi and the venue being the seat. 
52. Respondent before the learned single judge have not denied the assertion of the Appellant that Venue being in Delhi is the Seat of Arbitration and thus the Courts at Delhi have the jurisdiction to entertain all proceedings under the Arbitration Act. 
53. Reference may be had to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in S.N. Prasad v. Monnet Finance Ltd., (2011) 1 SCC 320wherein the Supreme Court has held thatthe words, statements of claim and defence occurring in Section 7(4)(c) of the Act, are not restricted to the statements of claim and defence filed before the arbitrator. If there is an assertion of existence of an arbitration agreement in any suit, petition or application filed before any court, and if there is no denial thereof in the defence/counter/written statement thereto filed by the other party to such suit, petition or application, then it can be said that there is an exchange of statements of claim and defence for the purposes of Section 7(4)(c) of the Act. It follows that if in the application filed under Section 11 of the Act, the applicant asserts the existence of an arbitration agreement with each of the respondents and if the respondents do not deny the said assertion, in their statement of defence, the court can proceed on the basis that there is an arbitration agreement in writing between the parties.
54. In K.P. Ranga Rao v. K.V. Venkatesham, (2015) 13 SCC 514the Supreme Court referring to Section 21 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the judgment in Pathumma v. KuntalanKutty (1981) 3 SCC 589held that Pathumma (supra)really concludes the matter and in order that an objection to the place of suing may be entertained by an appellate or revisional court, the fulfilment of the following three conditions is essential:(1) The objection was taken in the court of first instance; (2) It was taken at the earliest possible opportunity and in cases where issues are settled, at or before such settlement and (3) There has been a consequent failure of justice. The Supreme Court held that all these three conditions must coexist.
55. The Supreme Court further held that the appellate court or revisional court shall not allow an objection to the place of suing  unless such objection was taken in the court of first instance at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues are settled at or before such settlement. What follows is important. An objection as to place of suing cannot be allowed unless there has been a consequent failure of justice.
56. As noticed above, the assertion of the Appellants of the Delhi Courts having jurisdiction has not been denied before the learned Single Judge and as such the Respondents are precluded from raising the same in Appeal.
57. Even, if the objection of jurisdiction could be raised before the Appellate Court, since the Venue has been held to be the Juridical Seat of Arbitration in terms of the Arbitration Agreement Clause 23, the Courts at Delhi had the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the Petition under section 9 of the Arbitration Act. Clause 23 expressly designates Delhi at the Venue for arbitration and there is no designation of an alternative place as the Seat, the inexorable conclusion is that the stated Venue i.e. Delhi is the juridical seat of the arbitral proceedings. Clause 19 would be relevant only if by an agreement both parties decided not to settle their disputes through arbitration but by approaching a Court of law, in which case the exclusive jurisdiction would be of the Courts at Gurugram, Haryana. 
58. Reliance placed by learned senior counsel for the respondent on Enercon (India) Ltd. vs Enercon GmbH [Enercon (India) Ltd. v. Enercon GmbH (2014) 5 SCC 1is misplaced. In the said case, the Supreme Court found that the seat of arbitration was fixed in India but the venue was in London.  The Supreme Court held that as the parties had agreed that the governing law would be the law of India and the Provision of Indian Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 was to apply, the seat was fixed in India.  In the present case there is no separate stipulation which could fix the seat for the purposes of arbitration Act at a place different from the venue. As held hereinabove the Venue being Delhi also fixed the seat for the purposes of Arbitration at Delhi.
59. Further, reliance placed on the judgment in Mankatsu Impex Private Limited vs. Airvisual Limited (2020) 5 SCC 399is also misplaced. Rather the said judgment supports the case of the Appellants. In the said case, the contract stipulated that the MoU was governed by laws of India and courts at New Delhi shall have the jurisdiction but with regard to arbitration it stipulated that any dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in Hong Kong and the place of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The Supreme Court held that reference to Hong Kong as place of arbitration is not a simple reference as the venue for the arbitral proceedings; but a reference to Hong Kong was for final resolution by arbitration administered in Hong Kong. The words arbitration administered in Hong Kong is indicia that the seat of arbitration is at Hong Kong. Once parties had chosen Hong Kong as the place of arbitration to be administered in Hong Kong, the laws of Hong Kong would govern the arbitration. The Indian courts have no jurisdiction for appointment of the arbitrator.
60. The judgment in Kush Raj Bhatia vs. DLF Power and Services Limited 2022 SCC OnLine Del 3309is not applicable to the facts of the present case for the reason that in the said case, the same clause stipulated that the place of holding arbitration proceedings and that the civil courts at Gurgaon and High Court at Chandigarh alone shall have jurisdiction. The court thus held the seat to be in Gurgaon. 
61. Meenakshi Nehra Bhat and Another vs Wave Megacity Private Limited 2022 SCC Online Del 3744does not further the case of the Respondent for the reason that the arbitration clause in that case stipulated that the Arbitration Proceedings shall be held at New Delhi and the courts at Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh shall to the exclusion of all other courts, alone have the exclusive jurisdiction in all matters arising out of/or concerning the Application Form/this Arrangement, regardless of the place of execution of this Arrangement. This will be without prejudice to the territorial and statutory jurisdiction of Allahabad High Court. The stipulation that the Courts at Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh shall have exclusive jurisdiction was also part of the Arbitration Clause unlike the present case where the clauses are different and the Arbitration Clause not containing a contradictory stipulation. 
62. Reliance placed by learned counsel for the respondent on the judgment in the case of BBR (India) Private Limited vs. S.P. Singla Constructions Private limited (2023) 1 SCC 693 does not further the case of the Respondent for the reason that the issue in the said case was as to whether conducting arbitration proceedings at Delhi owing to appointment of a new arbitrator would shift the jurisdictional seat of arbitration from Punchkula in Haryana, the place fixed by the first arbitrator for the arbitration proceedings. The court noticed that the Arbitral Tribunal had fixed the seat at Panchkula and thus by mere change of arbitrator and holding subsequent sittings at New Delhi and publishing of the award in Delhi would not change the seat of arbitration, where it was initially fixed in Panchkula to Delhi. 
63. In view of the above, the objection of territorial jurisdiction raised by the Respondents is accordingly decided in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondents. It is held that clause 23 of the Collaboration Agreement providing for Venue of Arbitration at Delhi is indicative of the fact that the arbitral proceedings are intended to be anchored to Delhi and Delhi being the Seat of Arbitration,the Courts at Delhi would have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain all proceedings under the Arbitration Act pertaining to disputes and differences arising out of or in connection with the interpretation or implementation of the Collaboration Agreement, or out of or in connection with the breach, or alleged breach of the Collaboration Agreement.
64. List the appeal for directions before the Roster bench on 20.03.2024.

1. Petitioner seeks a direction to the respondent to refund the GST 
in the sum of Rs. 16,19,838/ - to the petitioner which has been 
deposited against the non -migrated G ST  i.e. 07AAAC B0226C 1ZJ.  
2. Petitioner  was earlier registered during Service Tax Regime and  
 
 
 
W.P.(C) 13075/2023                                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 4 
  possessed a VAT number as also a service tax number. When the GST 
Regime came into play, the earlier registration of VAT and Service 
Tax were to be migrated into a G ST number.  
3. Since one individual could not have two GST numbers, 
petitioner opted for migration of only one number i.e.  its VAT 
registration and was allotted a GST number  No.0 7AAAC B0226C2ZI .  
4. As per the petitioner, petitioner  was not aware that the service  
tax registration number ha d also been migrated without his knowledge 
and a GST number i ssued i .e. No.0 7AAAC B0226C2ZI  (non-migrated 
GST number ). 
5.  As per the petitioner, petitioner , after such migration , has only 
been using the migrated GST number and was n ot even aware of the 
non-migrated GST number. Petitioner became aware of the non-
migrated GST number when one of the clients of the petitioner 
claimed to have deposited the GST credit  and the same was not 
reflected in the migrated GST number.  
6. As per the p etitioner , on a search being conducted on the portal, 
petitioner became aware  of the non -migrated number  and also found 
that an amount of Rs. 16,19,838/ - was lying to the credit of the 
petitioner in the non -migrated GST number.  
7.  Petitioner seeks refund of  the said amount or alternative credit  
 
 
 
W.P.(C) 13075/2023                                                                                                                                          Page 3 of 4 
  of the said amount to the migrated GST number.  
8. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent submits that there 
is no provision available in the GST portal for transfer of the credit 
from one GST number to another. He  however concedes that the 
petitioner did not opt for the migration of the service tax registration 
and the system automatically  created a GST  number  (i.e. the non-
migrated GST number ). 
9.  Keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the 
case, we direct that the amount standing to the credit of the non -
migrated GST number be transferred to the migrated GST number of 
the petitioner.  
10. The petit ion is disposed of in  the above terms.  
11. Further,  respondent and the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and 
Custo ms are directed to look into the issue of the automatic generation 
of non -migrated GST number and in case such a technical error is 
noticed in the portal, rectificatory steps be taken for identifying such 
non-migrated numbers and cancellation thereof withi n a period of four 
weeks from today.

migrated GST number s which are still active on 08.04.2024.

REKHA PALLI, J (O RAL)  
 
1. The present writ petition under Article s 226 & 227 of the Constitution 
of India seeks to assail the order dated 02.02.2023 passed by the learned 
Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A.1667/2019.  
2. Vide the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has set a side the orders 
dated 03.01.2019, 27.11.2018, 25.01.2019, 04.01.2019, and  28.02.2019,  
passed by the petitioners  by directing them to include the two years period 
during which the respo ndents were undergoing training  towards qualifying 
service for deciding  their eligibility for grant of financia l upgradation under 
the ACP/ MACP Scheme.  
3. Before we deal with the rival submissions of the parties, it may be  
W.P.(C) 13476/2023                                                                Page 2 of 5 
 apposite to note the brief  factual matrix of the  case.  
4. Upon being selected for the post of Surveyor , the respondents joined 
the petitioner organisation on different dates between 1982 -1987 and were 
directed to undergo 2 years training, during which period they were known 
as Topographical Trainee Type -A (TTT) ‘A’. Upon successful completion 
of the training  period the respondents were posted as Surveyors. In 2004 , 
some surveyors and  Topographical Trainee Type -B (TTT ‘B’) raised a claim 
by way of O.A 73/2004 for counting their period of training towards 
qualifying period required for grant of benefit under the MAC P scheme.  
This OA was disposed of by the learned Tribunal on 29.11.2004, by 
directing the petitioners to consider the claim of the respondents  therein  for 
grant of the benefits under the ACP scheme by reckoning the training period  
undergone by them. This order  was assailed by the petitioners by way of  
W.P. (C) 8341/2009 which writ petition  came to be dismissed on 
11.09.2011 . The order dated 11.09.2011  was unsuccessfully assailed by the 
petitioners before the Apex Court by way of SLP (Civil) No. 2584/2012 . 
Upon the order dated 20.11.2004 passed in OA 73/2004 attaining finality , 
the petitioners extended the benefit of the said decision only to the 
applicants in the said OA.  
5. Being aggrieved, the respondents approached the learned Tribunal by 
way of OA 1667/201 9, which original application has been allowed under 
the impugned order by directing the petitioners to extend the benefits 
granted vide order dated 20.11.2004 in OA 73/2004 to the respondents 
herein.    
6. In support of the petition, Mr. Vinnet Dhandha, l earned counsel for 
the petitioners submits that the impugned order is  liable  to be set aside as the  
W.P.(C) 13476/2023                                                                Page 3 of 5 
 learned Tribunal has erroneously come to a conclusion that the two years 
training period  undergone  by the respondents  should be treated  as qualifying 
service  for grant of benefits under the ACP and MACP scheme .  He submits 
that the period of two years during which the respondents were undergoing 
training as per the provisions of the Recruitment Rules  for Topographical 
Division  I Establishment , could not be count ed towar ds their service and 
was therefore rightly excluded from the qualifying period for grant of 
benefits under the ACP/MACP scheme . He, therefore, prays that the 
impugned order be set aside.  
7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents suppo rts the 
impu gned order and submits that after  the respondents joined the petitioner  
organization , the mere fact of them being sent on training could not imply 
that they were not in service during this 2 years training period. She further 
submits that once the petitioners has granted same relief to  similarly  placed 
persons like the applicants in OA 73/2004, they cannot be permitted to 
discriminate against the respondents  by excluding their training period from

1. The present writ petition under Articles 226 & 227 of the Constitution of India seeks to assail the order dated 02.02.2023 passed by the learned Central Administrative Tribunal in O.A.1667/2019.
2. Vide the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has set aside the orders dated 03.01.2019, 27.11.2018, 25.01.2019, 04.01.2019, and 28.02.2019,  passed by the petitioners by directing them to include the two years period during which the respondents were undergoing training towards qualifying service for deciding their eligibility for grant of financial upgradation under the ACP/MACP Scheme.
3. Before we deal with the rival submissions of the parties, it may be apposite to note the brief factual matrix of the case. 
4. Upon being selected for the post of Surveyor, the respondents joined the petitioner organisation on different dates between 1982-1987 and were directed to undergo 2 years training, during which period they were known as Topographical Trainee Type-A (TTT) A. Upon successful completion of the training period the respondents were posted as Surveyors. In 2004, some surveyors and Topographical Trainee Type-B (TTT B) raised a claim by way of O.A 73/2004 for counting their period of training towards qualifying period required for grant of benefit under the MACP scheme.  This OA was disposed of by the learned Tribunal on 29.11.2004, by directing the petitioners to consider the claim of the respondents therein for grant of the benefits under the ACP scheme by reckoning the training period undergone by them. This order was assailed by the petitioners by way of W.P. (C) 8341/2009 which writ petition came to be dismissed on 11.09.2011. The order dated 11.09.2011 was unsuccessfully assailed by the petitioners before the Apex Court by way of SLP (Civil)No. 2584/2012. Upon the order dated 20.11.2004 passed in OA 73/2004 attaining finality, the petitioners extended the benefit of the said decision only to the applicants in the said OA. 
5. Being aggrieved, the respondents approached the learned Tribunal by way of OA 1667/2019, which original application has been allowed under the impugned order by directing the petitioners to extend the benefits granted vide order dated 20.11.2004 in OA 73/2004 to the respondents herein.   
6. In support of the petition, Mr. Vinnet Dhandha, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the impugned order is liable to be set aside as the learned Tribunal has erroneously come to a conclusion that the two years training period undergone by the respondents should be treated as qualifying service for grant of benefits under the ACP and MACP scheme.  He submits that the period of two years during which the respondents were undergoing training as per the provisions of the Recruitment Rules for Topographical Division I Establishment, could not be counted towards their service and was therefore rightly excluded from the qualifying period for grant of benefits under the ACP/MACP scheme. He, therefore, prays that the impugned order be set aside. 
7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents supports the impugned order and submits that after the respondents joined the petitioner organization, the mere fact of them being sent on training could not imply that they were not in service during this 2 years training period. She further submits that once the petitioners has granted same relief to similarly placed persons like the applicants in OA 73/2004, they cannot be permitted to discriminate against the respondents by excluding their training period from the qualifying service. She, therefore, prays that the writ petition be dismissed.  
8. Having considered the rival submissions of the parties, we may begin by noting hereinbelow the relevant extracts of the impugned order as contained in paras 4 and 5 thereof:

1. The present petition under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of 
India seeks to assail the order dated 29.07.2021 passed by the learned 
Central Administrative Tribunal (Tribunal) in Original Application 
(O.A.) No. 1271/2021.  Vide the impugned order, the learned 
Tribunal has allowed the O.A. preferred by the respondent and has 
consequently, directed the petitioner to extend the benefits of 
promotion to the respondent at par with his junior by treating him as 
having been qualified the ex amination for promotion to the post of                                                                
  
W.P.(C) 1 1691 /2022                                                                Page 2 of 4 
 Assistant Director (Ministerial) held in 2005 and notionally fix his last 
drawn pay so that his pension can be suitably revised and grant him 
arrears of revised pension accordingly.  
2. In support of the petition, learned  counsel for the petitioner submits 
that the impugned order is wholly perverse as the learned Tribunal 
has, without any basis, interfered with the administrative decision 
taken by the petitioner to not grant any benefit to the respondent of 
passing the dep artmental examination  conducted in 2005 for 
promotion to the post of Assistant Director (Ministerial)  after such an 
inordinate delay. She contends that even though the respondent has 
been declared as having passed the said examination, the same was 
only af ter the third re -evaluation of his language paper conducted on 
11.10.2013. However, once it was realised that there were basic 
infirmities in the examination process itself, the petitioner was 
justified in not granting any benefit to the respondent of havi ng 
qualified the said examination, which aspect the learned Tribunal had 
failed to appreciate. She, therefore, prays that the impugned order be 
set aside.  
3. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent supports the 
impugned order and submits that t he learned Tribunal, after 
consideration of the entire material brought on record by the parties, 
has rightly arrived at a conclusion that the respondent has been 
discriminated against as he was denied the benefit of his promotion 
despite his having cleare d the departmental exam held in 2005.  
Furthermore, when all other employees who had qualified the said 
examination, which the petitioner now claims was riddled with                                                                
  
W.P.(C) 1 1691 /2022                                                                Page 3 of 4 
 infirmities, were granted promotion based on the result of the very 
same examination, the respondent could not be discriminated against 
and denied his due promotion to the post of Assistant Director 
(Ministerial) from 2006, when all other candidates who had qualified 
the said examination were promoted. She, therefore, prays that the 
writ petiti on be dismissed.  
4. Having considered the submissions of learned counsel for the parties 
and perused the record, we find that on the one hand the petitioner is 
urging that there were infirmities in the conduct of the examination 
itself and on the other hand,  they have themselves granted promotion 
based on the very said examination to all candidates who had 
qualified the said examination including many persons junior to the 
respondent. Even if the petitioner’s plea that the examination was 
riddled with infirmi ties were to be accepted, the fact remains that 
promotion to the post of Assistant Director was granted in 2006 to all 
candidates who had qualified in the said examination.  
5. We are, therefore, of the considered view that the respondent having 
cleared the l imited departmental exam held in 2005, albeit after the 
third re -evaluation, cannot be denied the benefits of promotion to the 
post of Assistant Director (Ministerial) from 2006 . In fact, it emerges 
that most of the candidates who were beneficiaries of the  said 
examination have superannuated after having been promoted not only 
as Assistant Director but also as Deputy Director. During the course 
of arguments, we are informed that the respondent was later promoted 
as Assistant Director based on the limited de partmental examination 
held in 2011 and was thereafter promoted as Deputy Director , from                                                                
  
W.P.(C) 1 1691 /2022                                                                Page 4 of 4 
 which post he superannuated on 31.01.2020.  
6. In the light of the aforesaid, we are of the considered view that the 
learned Tribunal was justified in holding that the re spondent could not 
be discriminated against and, therefore, ought to be granted the 
benefit of promotion to the post of Assistant Director (Ministerial) on 
notional basis w.e.f. 16.01.2006. We, therefore, find no reason to 
interfere with the impugned order  and, therefore, dismiss the writ 
petition by clarifying that under the impugned order, the respondent 
will be granted only notional promotion as Assistant Director w.e.f. , 
16.01.2006 and  will not be entitled to any arrears of wages on account 
of this ante  dated promotion. However, as directed by the learned 
Tribunal, the respondent’s pension will be appropriately re -fixed by 
taking into account his ante dated promotion as Assistant Director 
w.e.f. 16.01.2006. Arrears of the differential amount payable on 
account of the revised pension will be paid  to the respondent  within 
eight weeks.  
7. The writ petition, along with all pending applications, stands disposed 
of in the aforesaid terms.

2. These are two petitions filed by the Petitioner -M/s. Dalip Singh 
Adhikari under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 
(hereinafter, ‘1996 Act’) where the Petitioner prays for appointment of the 
ld. Sole Arbitrator for adjudication of disputes arising out of an Insurance 
Policy titled ‘Contractor’s All Risk Policy’ purchased by the Petitioner on  
ARB.P. 106/2024  & ARB.P. 131/2024    Page 2 of 5 
 30th May, 2018 and subsequently renewed on 30th May, 2019 and 3rd 
January, 2020.   
3. The Petitioner’s case is that it was awarded a contract for the 
construction work of the Tawaghat Thanidhar Motor Road, Stage -1, 
covering a total length of 14 kms, for a sum of Rs. 15,08,10,700 /- by the 
Uttarakhand Rural Roads Development Agency ('URRDA') . This contract 
and the corresponding works order included insurance against various risks, 
such as landslides  and rainfall, with the policy being purchased from the 
Respondent -New India Assurance Co. Ltd . 
4. According to the Petitioner, during the validity of the policy 
(including the extensions), due to two heavy landslides on 13th July, 2019 
(ARB.P. 131/2024 ) and 28th July, 2020 (ARB.P. 106/2024 ), damage was 
caused to the project due to which the Petitioner raised various claims. 
According to the Petitioner, the Respondent -Insurance Company appointed a 
Surveyor, M/s Select Insurance Surveyor & Loss Assessors Pvt . Ltd. which 
submitted its Final Survey Report dated 18th May, 2022 . 
5. In the Final Survey Report, the Surveyor quantified the claims of the 
Petitioner. However, the Respondent -Insurance Company reduced these 
amounts and, according to the Petitioner, pressured them to accept sums of 
Rs.1,96,26,847/ - and Rs.1,50,94,709/ -, as opposed to the much higher 
claims initially made by the Petitioner. These amounts were paid on 17th 
April, 2023. Subsequently, the Petitioner issued a legal notice on 18th April, 
2023, claiming additional amounts, which the Respondent -Insurance 
Company r efuted, leading to the prayer for appointment of the ld. Sole 
Arbitrator.  Thereafter, on 17th October, 2023, the Petitioner issued a notice 
under Section 21 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996.    
ARB.P. 106/2024  & ARB.P. 131/2024    Page 3 of 5 
 6. On behalf of the Respondent -the Insurance Company, the stance is 
that the amounts received by the Petitioner were accepted as a full and final 
settlement without any objection s and the amount was paid in terms of a 
further Surveyor Report which was submitted.  After receiving the amounts 
on 17th April, 202 3, the Petitioner chose to issue a legal notice the very next 
day, as an afterthought .  
7. The Respondent -Insurance Company relies on the emails dated 6th 
February, 2023, written on behalf of the Petitioner, which accepted the 
consent of the Petitioner’s project director.  
8. However, in response, the ld. C ounsel for the Petitioner submits that 
the acceptance was made under pressure, as evident from the letter dated 
29th December, 2022. In  this letter, the Petitioner clearly stated that the 
consent was give n subject to various conditions, indicating that the amount 
was being received under protest and the deductions were not acceptable . 
The said letter reads  as follows:  
“We refer to our various emails & letters and your 
subsequent emails dated 21 .12.2022; 26.12.2022; 
27.12.2022 & 28.12.2022 advising us to provide a 
letter of our consent to the revised assessment of Rs. 
1,96,26,847/ - vide addendum survey report dated 
28.11.2022 as worked out  by the surveyor M/s Select 
Insurance Surveyors & Loss Assessors (P) Ltd.   
We have gone through the Final Survey Report dated 
18.05.2020 & Addendum Survey Report dated 
28.11.2022. We agree and give our consent to Rs. 
l,96,26,847/ - and it is made strictly on the following 
basis:  
•This amount is received by us under protest  
•The deduction of amount on account of section 
warranty clause are not agreed or admitted   
ARB.P. 106/2024  & ARB.P. 131/2024    Page 4 of 5 
 •The deduction of amount more than Rs. 25,00,000/ - 
as 5% Excess subject to minimum of Rs. 25,0 0,000/ - 
are not agreed or admitted  
•The said payment received should  not be regarded as 
such on admission or agreement  
• The right is reserved to challenge these deduction to 
a court or tribunal accordingly including as per 
IRDA (Protection of Policyholders' Interests) 
Regulation, 2002 ” 
 
9. Heard. After reviewing the emails and correspondence between the 
parties, this Court is of the opinion  that the question as to  whether there was 
a full and final settlement with the payments made on 17th April, 2023, 
constitutes an arbitra ble dispute. The correspondence and the conduct of the 
parties —prior to, contemporaneous with, and following the payment —
would need to be considered by the ld. Sole Arbitrator . 
10. As of now, considering the facts and circumstances, it cannot be 
concluded from the emails sent by the Petitioner that a full and final 
settlement has been reached, and that there are no arbitrable disputes. 
Therefore, this issue would need to be adjudicated by the ld. Sole Arbitrator. 
Accordingly, given the facts and circumstances of this case, Justice 
S.P.Garg (Retd) (M-9910384627 ) is appointed as the ld. Sole Arbitrator to 
adjudicate the disputes arising out of the Insurance Policy dated 30th May, 
2018, and its extensions . 
11. The fee of the Arbitrator shall be as per the Fourth Schedule of the 
1996 Act and the DIAC Rules. The arbitration shall take place under the 
aegis of the DIAC.  
12. Let a copy of this order be emailed to the Secretary, DIAC on email

for the Petitioner submits that the partnership firm is registered , and the copy 
of the same has been fur nished in Court .

The deduction of amount more than Rs. 25,00,000/- as 5% Excess subject to minimum of Rs. 25,00,000/- are not agreed or admitted 
The said payment received should not be regarded as such on admission or agreement 
 The right is reserved to challenge these deduction to a court or tribunal accordingly including as per IRDA (Protection of Policyholders' Interests) Regulation, 2002

9.	Heard. After reviewing the emails and correspondence between the parties, this Court is of the opinion that the question as to whether there was a full and final settlement with the payments made on 17th April, 2023, constitutes an arbitrable dispute. The correspondence and the conduct of the partiesprior to, contemporaneous with, and following the paymentwould need to be considered by the ld. Sole Arbitrator.
10.	As of now, considering the facts and circumstances, it cannot be concluded from the emails sent by the Petitioner that a full and final settlement has been reached, and that there are no arbitrable disputes. Therefore, this issue would need to be adjudicated by the ld. Sole Arbitrator. Accordingly, given the facts and circumstances of this case, Justice S.P.Garg (Retd) (M-9910384627) is appointed as the ld. Sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes arising out of the Insurance Policy dated 30th May, 2018, and its extensions.
11.	The fee of the Arbitrator shall be as per the Fourth Schedule of the 1996 Act and the DIAC Rules. The arbitration shall take place under the aegis of the DIAC.
12.	Let a copy of this order be emailed to the Secretary, DIAC on email id. delhiarbitrationcentre@gmail.com.
13.	Ld. Counsel for the Respondent submits that the Petitioner cannot maintain this petition, as it is not a registered partnership firm. Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the partnership firm is registered, and the copy of the same has been furnished in Court.  
14.	List before the ld. Sole Arbitrator on 18th March, 2024.
15.	The petitions are disposed of with all pending applications, if any.

NAVIN CHAWLA, J. (ORAL)   
 
1. This petition has been filed un der Section 482 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, ‘Cr.P.C.’) 
challenging the Order dated 02.11.2021 passed by the learned 
Principal District and Sessions Judge , South -West  District , 
Dwarka Courts, New Delhi in Criminal Revision Petition, being 
CR No. 224/2020 , titled Dr.Kiran Pal Singh v. Smt. Purnima 
Singh , dismissing the Revision Petition filed by the petitioner 
herein against the Order dated 20.08.2020 passed by the learned 
Metropolitan Magistrate -07, South -West  District , Dwarka 
Courts, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Trial Court’) 
in Complaint Case No. 40222/19 , titled as above.  
2. By the order dated 20.08.2020, the learned Trial Court  
was pleased to dismiss the complaint filed by the petitioner 
herein under Section 200 of the C r.P.C. for want of territorial  
CRL.M.C. 3370/2022                                                       Page 2 of 4 
 jurisdiction of that Court.  
3. The above complaint was filed by the petitioner praying 
for the learned Trial Court to take cognizance of the offence 
under Section s 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in 
short, ‘IPC’) aga inst the respondent herein.  
4. Only for the purpose s of jurisdiction, the relevant 
paragraphs/averments in the complaint are reproduced 
hereinunder: - 
“21. That the accused has deliberately and 
dishonestly published the defamatory posts on 
her Facebook profil e which are false and 
slanderous in nature and by imputing the 
complainant with such remarks on social 
platform, the accused has committed the 
offence of defamation as envisaged under 
section 499 of IPC and therefore, the accused 
is liable to be punished i n accordance with the 
provision of 500 IPC.  
22. That there is a prima facie case against the 
accused under section 499 and 500 of IPC. 
There is enough material on record before this 
Hon'ble court to summon, try and punish the 
accused for the offences comm itted.  
23. That this Hon'ble court has jurisdiction to 
entertain the present complaint as the offence 
has been committed with in the local 
jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court.”  
 
5. Clearly , the complaint , without specifying the place of 
offence , stated that i t had been committed within the local 
jurisdiction of the Court. The learned Trial Court , vide the 
Impugned Order dated 20.08.202 0, observed that the 
complainant is a resident of Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, which is 
beyond the jurisdiction of the said Court, w hile the two  
CRL.M.C. 3370/2022                                                       Page 3 of 4 
 addresses mentioned of the respondent in the complaint , are 
situated at Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The learned Trial Court 
further observed that in the entire complaint , the complainant 
has not mentioned as to where the publication and the 
consequent defamation ha ve taken place. As noted hereinabove, 
the learned Trial Court, therefore, dismissed the complaint 
observing that the  said Court did not have the territorial 
jurisdiction to adjudicate on the said complaint.  
6. The petitioner , being aggri eved by the said order , filed a 
Revision Petition under Section 397 of the Cr.P.C., which has 
been dismissed by the Impugned Order observing as under: - 
“As noticed earlier, in the case at hand, there 
is no averment or pleading in the complaint, 
as regards the invocation of territorial 
jurisdiction. If the court presumes that the 
respondent published or posted the facebook 
post from her home address, in that case the 
jurisdiction did not lie with the trial court, as 
the address of the respondent has been 
mentioned in the memo of parties before this 
court to be Lucknow or Gurgaon. Trial Court 
has also observed the same in the impugned 
Order, when it mentioned that two of her 
addresses are mentioned as one of Uttar 
Pradesh and the other of Haryana. As regards 
the jurisdiction on the basis of publication, 
again there being no averment, Trial Court 
has observed that the witness is residing in 
Ghaziabad, UP and therefore, publication qua 
him would not have taken place within the 
jurisdiction of PS -Chhawala New Delh i.” 
 
7. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the 
respondent published the alleged defamatory  post on her  
CRL.M.C. 3370/2022                                                       Page 4 of 4 
 facebook profile within the jurisdiction of the Court s at Dwarka. 
He submits that, therefore, the Court s at Dwarka would have the 
territori al jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and proceed 
against the respondent.  
8. I am unable to find any merit in the contentions raised by 
the learned counsel for the petitioner.  
9. The contents of the complaint ha ve been reproduced 
hereinabove. They do not mention where the publication has 
taken place. The learned Trial Court as also the learned 
Revision Court have rightly relied upon the Memo of Parties to 
observe that neither the complaint nor the respondent resides 
within the territorial jurisdiction of t he said Court s. They have 
further observed that there is no mention of where the alleged 
publication took place nor is there a mention on where its 
consequences were felt.  
10. In my view, therefore, no fault can be found in the Orders 
impugned in the present petition.  
11. The petition is , accordingly , dismissed.  
12. Needless to state , the dismissal of the present petition is 
not on merit,  and it shall be open to the complain ant to file  a 
complaint before the Court of appropriate jurisdiction, if so 
advised  and in acc ordance with law .

This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, Cr.P.C.) challenging the Order dated 02.11.2021 passed by the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, South-West District, Dwarka Courts, New Delhi in Criminal Revision Petition, being CR No. 224/2020, titled Dr.Kiran Pal Singh v.

2. By the order dated 20.08.2020, the learned Trial Court was pleased to dismiss the complaint filed by the petitioner herein under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. for want of territorial jurisdiction of that Court.
3. The above complaint was filed by the petitioner praying for the learned Trial Court to take cognizance of the offence under Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short, IPC) against the respondent herein. 
4. Only for the purposes of jurisdiction, the relevant paragraphs/averments in the complaint are reproduced hereinunder:-
21. That the accused has deliberately and dishonestly published the defamatory posts on her Facebook profile which are false and slanderous in nature and by imputing the complainant with such remarks on social platform, the accused has committed the offence of defamation as envisaged under section 499 of IPC and therefore, the accused is liable to be punished in accordance with the provision of 500 IPC.

5. Clearly, the complaint, without specifying the place of offence, stated that it had been committed within the local jurisdiction of the Court. The learned Trial Court, vide the Impugned Order dated 20.08.2020, observed that the complainant is a resident of Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, which is beyond the jurisdiction of the said Court, while the two addresses mentioned of the respondent in the complaint, are situated at Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The learned Trial Court further observed that in the entire complaint, the complainant has not mentioned as to where the publication and the consequent defamation have taken place. As noted hereinabove, the learned Trial Court, therefore, dismissed the complaint observing that the said Court did not have the territorial jurisdiction to adjudicate on the said complaint. 
6. The petitioner, being aggrieved by the said order, filed a Revision Petition under Section 397 of the Cr.P.C., which has been dismissed by the Impugned Order observing as under:-
As noticed earlier, in the case at hand, there is no averment or pleading in the complaint, as regards the invocation of territorial jurisdiction.

He submits that, therefore, the Courts at Dwarka would have the territorial jurisdiction to entertain the complaint and proceed against the respondent. 
8. I am unable to find any merit in the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner.

I.A. 907/2023 in CS(COMM) 29/2023
1. Kudos Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Kudos” hereinafter) is the
registered proprietor of Indian Patent IN 228720 (IN’ 720) (hereinafter
referred to as “the suit patent”), issued on 12 March 2004 for a period
of 20 years. The patent certificate was granted for an invention
entitled “Phthalazinone derivative”.
2. Claim I of the suit patent read thus:
“1. A Phthalazione derivative of the following formula.
Or isomers, salts or solvates thereof.
3. The application for grant of Suit Patent was filed in India on 31
August 2005 with a priority date of 12 March 2003. It was granted by
the Indian Patent Office (IPO) on 10 February 2009.
4. There has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit
patent. It is only after the present suit was filed that the defendant
Natco Pharma Limited (“Natco” hereinafter) filed CO (COMM.IPD-CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 3of69PAT) 1/2023 under Section 64(1)1of the Patents Act, 1970 (“1970”),
seeking revocation of the suit patent.
5. The compound claimed in Claim I of the suit patent has been
assigned the IUPAC name “Olaparib”.
6. There is no dispute that, even while the suit patent continues to
remain alive and subsisting, Natco has manufactured and sold its own
generic version of Olaparib under the brand name BRACANAT.
7. This, contends Kudos, amounts to infringement of the suit
patent. Kudos has, therefore, instituted the present suit before this
Court seeking a decree of permanent injunction, restraining Natco
164. Revocation of patent-
(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted before or after the
commencement of this Act, may, be revoked on a petition of any person interested or of the Central
Government by the Appellate Board or on a counter-claim in a suit for infringement of the patent by
the High Court on any of the following grounds, that is to say—
(a) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification,
was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete
specification of another patent granted in India;
*****
(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is
not new, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the
priority date of the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the
documents referred to in section 13;
(f) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is
obvious or does not involve any inventive step, having regard to what was publicly known
or publicly used in India or what was published in India or elsewhere before the priority
date of the claim;
*****
(h) that the complete specification does not sufficiently and fairly describe the
invention and the method by which it is to be performed, that is to say, that the description
of the method or the instructions for the working of the invention as contained in the
complete specification are not by themselves sufficient to enable a person in India
possessing average skill in, and average knowledge of, the art to which the invention
relates, to work the invention, or that it does not disclose the best method of performing it
which was known to the applicant for the patent and for which he was entitled to claim
protection;
*****
(m) that the applicant for the patent has failed to disclose to the Controller the information
required by Section 8 or has furnished information which in any material particular was
false to his knowledge;CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 4of69from manufacturing or selling or otherwise dealing with any product
with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or otherwise.
8. Olaparib, it may be noted, is an oral poly (ADP- ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, used for treating various forms of
cancer. It is stated that, by inhibiting PARP, Olaparib preferentially
kills cancer cells. The mechanics by which Olaparib acts as an anti-
cancer drug are not of particular significance, insofar as the present
decision is concerned.
9. Along with the suit, the plaintiff has filed IA 907/2023 under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(CPC), seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants
from manufacturing or selling Olaparib, under any brand name,
pending disposal of the present suit.
10. This judgment disposes of the said IA 907 of 2023 and I.A.
153/2023 in C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023.
A prefatory note
11. In para 15 of the report in Astrazeneca v. Intas2, the Division
Bench of this Court has entered the following cautionary note, in the
matter of passing of interlocutory orders in intellectual property
matters:
“15. Supreme Court, in order dated 16thAugust, 2017 in Civil
Appeal No. 18892/2017 titled AZ Tech (India) v.Intex
2(2021) 87 PTC 374 (DB) , hereinafter referred to as “ Astrazeneca-I ”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 5of69Technologies (India) Limited , commented on the disturbing trend,
of the orders of disposal of applications for interim relief in
Intellectual Property Rights matters governing parties for a long
time, with exhaustive judgments, virtually on merits of the suit,
being written and expressed the need for addressing the said
malady. In fact, suo moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8/2017 titled Re
: Case Management of Original Suits , was initiated in pursuance
to the said order and in which proceedings this Court informed the
Supreme Court of the remedial measures being taken.”
12. More recently, the Supreme Court, in Pernod Ricard India Pvt.
Ltd. v. United Spirits Ltd3, echoed the above sentiment in the
following words:
“At the insistence of counsel for the petitioner, we clarify that it is
well settled proposition of law that decisions on interlocutory
applications are only made to protect rival interests pending suit.
Somehow the interim applications itself are treated as final
decision but it is not so. In all such cases, interim arrangements
should be made and the trial should proceed rather than to spend
time only on interlocutory applications. That protects the petitioner
against the apprehension that the impugned judgment may be cited
in other Court qua petitioner’s cases of a similar nature.”
13. The present order is passed on an interlocutory application
under Order XXXIX of the CPC. All that the Court has to see,
therefore, is whether there is a prima facie case in favour of the
plaintiff, whether the refusal of interim relief would result in
irreparable loss to the plaintiff, and which way the balance of
convenience would lie. A threadbare analysis of the entire dispute,
and findings which partake of a final expression of opinion on all
issues in controversy, is neither justified, nor even appropriate, at this
stage.
3Order dated 6September 2023 in SLP (C) 17674/2023CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 6of6914. Arguments in this case extended over several days. Written
submissions have also been tendered by both sides, with the
submissions of the plaintiff extending to 53 pages. If I were to return
findings on every issue argued, and on every plea urged, hardly
anything would survive for consideration in the suit.
15. The attempt is, therefore, to ensure that this order conforms to
the discipline of Order XXXIX of the CPC.
Rival Contentions
16. I have heard Mr. Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Kudos, and
Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the Natco at exhaustive length.
Submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand
17. Mr. Pravin Anand advanced the following submissions to justify
his prayer for interlocutory injunction:
(i) Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in Claim I
of the suit patent IN’720.
(ii) During the life of the suit patent and till the filing of C.O.
(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023, there has been no pre-grant or post-
grant opposition to the suit patent, which stands granted in as
many as 61 countries.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 7of69(iii) The first act of infringement of the suit patent, by Natco,
has taken place when the suit patent is in the 19thyear of its life.
The suit patent is, therefore, an old patent and is, therefore, prima
facie entitled to be treated as valid, strong and liable to be
enforced against third party infringers.
(iv) Olaparib was also covered by IN 245218 (IN’218)
registered in favor of the plaintiff which expired on 25 October
2021 titled ‘Substituted Benzyl Phthalazinones’.
(v) Claim I in IN’720 was as under :
“WE CLAIM:
A compound of the formula :
Or an isomer, salt, solvate, chemically protected form, and
prodrug thereof, wherein :
A and B together represent an optionally mono-
substituted, fused aromatic ring: Rc is -CH2-RL;
RL is phenyl substituted by a substituent selected from the
group consisting of :
C3-20 heterocyclyl; esler; amido; ureido; sulfonamino;
and acyloxy and optionally further substituted; and
RN is hydrogen.”
This is a Markush claim which covers, depending on the
selected substitutions from the suggested substitutions provided
in the claim, a large number of compounds – worked out in theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 8of69written submission of the plaintiff as in the range of 93600
million. This figure is not disputed by Natco. One among these
is Olaparib.
(vi) Thus, IN’218 neither claims nor discloses Olaparib.
Olaparib is merely one of the millions of compounds which fall
within the broad Markush coverage of Claim I in IN’218.
(vii) The specifications in IN’218 do not contain the necessary
teaching to guide a person skilled in the art to synthesize
Olaparib.
(viii) Natco is admittedly manufacturing and selling Olaparib.
Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in the suit patent
IN’720. The fact that Natco is infringing the suit patent,
therefore, stands admitted.
(ix) Natco has not cleared the way before infringing the suit
patent. It has not filed any pre or post grant opposition to the
suit patent. C.O. (COMM.) IPD-PAT 1/2023 has also been filed
by Natco only after the present suit was instituted by Kudos.
The very fact that Natco chose to launch its own generic version
of Olaparib, admittedly infringing the suit patent, without, in
the first instance, clearing the way, entitles Kudos to
interlocutory injunction.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 9of69(x) Clearing the way, moreover, would require Natco not to
just to file a revocation petition challenging the suit patent, but
also to succeed in its challenge. For the proposition that the
very act of infringing of the suit patent without Natco having
first clear the way entitles Kudos to an interim injunction, Mr.
Anand relies on para 87 of the report in Merck Sharp and
Dohme Corporation v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals4passed by
the Division Bench of this Court, the decision of the UK High
Court Actavis v. Lilly5and on the decision of the UK Court of
Appeal in Novartis AG v. Hospira6.
(xi) While it is true that, to justifiably oppose a prayer for
interim injunction, the defendant in a patent infringement suit is
only required to set up a credible challenge to the validity of the
suit patent, it cannot be said that Natco has set up such a
challenge.
(xii) InF . Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla Ltd7and Intex
Technologies (India) Ltd. v. Telefonaktiebolaget L.M.
Ericsson8, a credible challenge has been identified as one which
is strong, and which is not fanciful or moonshine. In assessing
whether a challenge is credible, the Division Bench in both
these decisions has held that the fact that the inventor had been
granted a patent for his invention after thorough scrutiny by the
4(2015) 63 PTC 257 , hereinafter referred to as “ Merck ”.
52015 EWHC 1955
62013 EWCA (Civ) 583
7(2009) 40 PTC 125(DEL) , hereinafter referred to as “ Roche-I ”.
82023 SCC OnLine Del 1845, hereinafter referred to as “ Intex ”.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 10of69Indian Patent Office was a relevant factor which had to be
accorded due weightage.
(xiii) The fact that no pre-grant or post-grant opposition had
been filed to the suit patent, till Natco decided to file a
revocation petition in the 19thyear of the life of the suit patent is
also a recognition of the validity of the suit patent and a factor
which entitles Kudos to interim injunction, applying the law
laid down by the House of Lords in American Cyanamide v.
Ethicon Ltd9.
(xiv) On the erroneous presumption that coverage implies
disclosure, Natco was seeking to incorrectly contend that
Olaparib stood disclosed in IN’218. In actual fact, coverage
and disclosure are distinct and different concepts. Coverage
does not imply disclosure. The fact that coverage and disclosure
are different and distinct stand acknowledged by the Supreme
Court in its judgment in Novartis AG v. UOI10as well as by the
Division Bench of Court in para 11.18.7 of its decision in FMC
Corporation v. Natco Pharma Ltd.11and by this Bench in
Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd12.
(xv) Disclosure of a chemical compound in a patent is done
only through an individual identification of that compound in
the patent document by its chemical name, chemical structure,
91975 UK HL 1
10(2013) 6 SCC 1
112023 SCC OnLine Del 106 , hereinafter referred to as “ FMC-I ”.
12(2023) SCC OnLine Del 106, hereinafter referred to as “ Novartis-I”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 11of69chemical formula, IUPAC name etc. Reliance is placed, for this
purpose, on paras 283 and 329 of the judgment of the Federal
Court of Australia in Eli-Lilly and Co. Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd .13
(xvi) InFMC-I , the Division Bench held that disclosure of a
compound in a genes patent cannot be presumed.
(xvii) The Supreme Court, in its judgment in Biswanath
Prasad v. Hindustan Metal Industries14and the US Court of
Appeals in Fujikawa v. Wattanasin15hold that the issue of
disclosure of a patent in specifications is a question of fact,
which has to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.
(xviii) There is a difference between coverage and claiming.
The fact that Olaparib is covered under the overall Markush
claim in IN’218 does not result in Olaparib being vulnerable to
invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.
(xix) In order for a claim in a patent to be invalided on the
ground of prior claiming, the invention in the two claims must
be identical. The Markush Claim I in IN’218 is clearly different
from Claim I in the suit patent which specifically claims and
discloses Olaparib. This has been sought to be demonstrated
thus:
132013 FCA 214, hereinafter referred to as “ Eli Lilly ”.
14(1979) 2 SCC 511
1529 USP Q. 2d 1895CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 12of69
In the genus patent IN’218, though millions of compounds
could be synthesized from the Markush Claim I, only 265
compounds were exemplified, and Olaparib was not one
amongst them. In order for a claim in a species patent to be
invalidated on the ground of prior claim in the genus patent, the
disclosure in the genus patent must be enabling; in other words,
it must enable a person skilled in the art to arrive at the species
patent from the teachings which it provides. Reliance is placed,
for this purpose, on The General Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. v.
Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd.16
(xx) There can be no question of double patenting or prior
claiming where the scope of earlier and later patent is different.
(xxi) In order to support his contention that the mere coverage
of the claim in the species patent, in the overall Markush
structure in the genus patent does not invalidate the species
patent on the ground of prior claiming, Mr. Anand relies on para
63.2 to 63.6 of Novartis-I , paras 12.5, 12.7 & 12.18 of the
judgment of this Bench in FMC Corporation v. Best Crop
16(1971) FSR 417CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 13of69Science LLP17and paras 191, 192 and 195 of Novartis AG v.
Natco Pharma Ltd.18, paras 10.5 to 10.8 of Astrazeneca v.
Torrent19andparas 26 to 30 of the Judgment of the UK Court
of Appeal in Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly
and Co. Ltd20.
(xxii) If Natco’s submissions were to be accepted, it would
invalidate all selection patents, which are recognized in this
country. Natco was seeking to contend that all species patents
were patents of addition under Section 3421and had, therefore,
necessarily to terminate with the genus patent. This was a
seriously flawed submission, and went against the well-
recognized theory of selection patents. Selection patents were
valid subject to their satisfying the three factor test, postulated
inRe. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.’s Patents22,followed by this
Court in its decision in FMC-I .
(xxiii) The suit patent could not be treated as a patent of addition
under Section 5423of the Patents Act, as was sought to be
17(2021) 87 PTC 217, hereinafter referred to as “ FMC-II ”
18(2021) SCC OnLine Del 5340, hereinafter referred to as “ Novartis-II”

2134. No anticipation if circumstances are only as described in sections 29,30, 31 and 32-
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the Controller shall not refuse to grant a patent, and a patent
shall not be revoked or invalidated by reason only of any circumstances which, by virtue of section 29 or
section 30 or section 31 or section 32, do not constitute an anticipation of the invention claimed in the
specification.
22(1930) 47 RPC 289 (Ch D)
2354. Patents of addition-
(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this section, where an application is made for a
patent in respect of any improvement in or modification of an invention described or disclosed in
the complete specification filed therefor (in this Act referred to as the ""main invention"") and the
applicant also applies or has applied for a patent for that invention or is the patentee in respect
thereof, the Controller may, if the applicant so requests, grant the patent for the improvement or
modification as a patent of addition.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 14of69contended by Natco. A patent of addition was filed with respect
to minor improvements over an invention described or
disclosed in an earlier patent. Olaparib is neither described nor
disclosed in the genus patent IN’218. Moreover, Olaparib was
not a mere improvement over the genus patent but constitutes
an entirely new invention.
(xxiv) The reliance on Section 53(4)24of the Patents Act, by
Natco is also misplaced. Natco was seeking to contend that, by
operation of Section 53(4), the expiry of the genus patent
IN’218 resulted ipso facto in falling, into the public domain all
subject matter covered by the genus patent even if it was neither
claimed nor disclosed in it. This was a fundamentally
misplaced submission. The protection available under Section
53(4) was as much available to the species patents as to the
genus patent. It is well-settled that multiple patents can cover
the same product. In such a case, the expiry of genus patent
does not result automatically into expiry of the species patents
or evisceration of the protection available under Section 53(4)
to the species patent.
(2) Subject to the provisions contained in this section, where an invention, being an
improvement in or modification of another invention, is the subject of an independent patent and
the patentee in respect of that patent is also the patentee in respect of the patent for the main
invention, the Controller may, if the patentee so requests, by order, revoke the patent for the
improvement or modification and grant to the patentee a patent of addition in respect thereof,
bearing the same date as the date of the patent so revoked.
(3) A patent shall not be granted as a patent of addition unless the date of filing of the
application was the same as or later than the date of filing of the application in respect of the main
invention.
(4) A patent of addition shall not be granted before grant of the patent for the main invention.
2453. Term of Patent-
*****
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, on
cessation of the patent right due to non-payment of renewal fee or on expiry of the term of patent,
the subject matter covered by the said patent shall not be entitled to any protection.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 15of69(xxv) This was clear from the expression “notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in
force”, with which Section 53(4) commences. The Patents Act
could not be treated as “other law” for the purposes of Section
53(4). While, therefore, Section 53(4) had supervening
application over other laws, it was nonetheless subject to the
Patents Act and, especially, to Sections 19, 91(1) and 141 (1)
thereof. Reliance was placed, for the interpretation “any other
law” on the judgment of the Supreme Court in P .
Virudhachalam v. Management of Lotus Mills25. The correct
interpretation to be placed on Section 53 (4) was, therefore, that
all compounds disclosed by the genus patent would be open to
the public upon its expiry. Inasmuch as Olaparib was not
specifically disclosed in the genus patent IN’218, the expiry of
IN’218 did not render Olaparib available in the public domain
for anyone to exploit.
(xxvi) A plea that Olaparib was disclosed in the Russian Genus
Patent RU’865 was also incorrect. Natco was seeking to
contend that RU’865 – which was the Russian equivalent to
IN’218 – also claimed a medicament used to treat cancer via
PARP inhibition. The reliance on RU’865 was, however,
misplaced as RU’865 did not disclose that any drug, let alone
Olaparib, commercially emerged from RU’865.
25(1998) 1 SCC 650CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 16of69(xxvii) Natco had sought to rely on the Form 27s filed by
Kudos, for the genus patent IN’218 and the species patent
IN’720. The filing of Form 27 did not amount to any kind of
admission that Olaparib was specifically disclosed in both the
patents. One product can conceivably be covered by several
patents and several patents could cover a single commercial
product. This position stands statutorily recognized by Sections
3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141 of the Patents Act. The amended
form 27 requires all patentees to file a single Form 27 for
multiple patents, provided all patents are related or worked
through one product. As such, the fact that one Form 27 had
been filed both for species patent IN’720 and genus patent
IN’218 did not constitute any admission that both disclosed
Olaparib. They were merely related patents, as genie and
species patents respectively.
(xxviii) Similarly, the Patent Term Extension (PTE)
application filed by Kudos in respect of Australian Patent AU
2001295789 (AU’789) – which corresponded to the Indian
genus Patent IN’218 – was completely irrelevant and did not
constitute any admission that Olaparib was disclosed in the
genus patent. The Patents Act in Australia provides PTEs to
account for delay which could occur when obtaining regulatory
approvals for pharmaceuticals. Reliance has been placed, in
this context, on Sections 70 to 79A of the Australian Patents
Act 1990. The above legal position stands exposited by this
Court in paras 67, 67.1 and 67.2 of its judgment in Novartis-I .CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 17of69(xxix) In PCT application WO 2021/224381 of Kudos, there
was an inadvertent statement that Olaparib was disclosed in
WO’976, which corresponded to the genus patent IN’218.
Immediate corrective steps had been taken by Kudos to rectify
this error and it now stands clarified that Olaparib was
described in WO’976, which corresponds to IN’720, the species
patent. That this was an error is also manifested from the fact
that Kudos applied for several other patents related to Olaparib,
referring to WO’976 as the patent which described Olaparib.
Specific instances in this regard have been provided.
(xxx) The challenge to the validity of the suit patent IN’720 on
the ground that it suffered from insufficiency of disclosure
under Section 64(1)(h) was not one which could be examined
by the court at an interlocutory stage. It was a question of fact,
not a question of law, and would have to be decided only once
evidence was led and Kudos was granted an opportunity to
cross examine its witnesses. Reliance is placed, for this
purpose, on the judgment of this Court in Communication
Components Antenna Inc v. Mobi Antenna Technologies
(Shenzen) Co. Ltd.26and on Terrell on the Law of Patents .
(xxxi) Natco’s reliance on Section 8(2) to the Patents Act, vis-à-
visthe omission on Kudos part to reveal details of the Patent
Applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO),
26Manu/DE/0946/2022CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 18of69corresponding to the suit patent IN’720 during the time of
prosecution of the application resulting in its grant, before the
Indian Patent office, was also unsustainable. Reliance has been
placed, in this context, on a letter written to Kudos by its Agent
on 14 December 2007, informing Kudos of the Section 8
objection raised by the IPO and requesting Kudos to supply the
search and examination report for corresponding patent
applications filed in the US and Europe. Such an inadvertent,
unintentional error would not amount to violation of Section
8(2) so as to disentitle the patentee to interlocutory relief.
Reliance has been placed, in this context, on paras 27 and 28 of
the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Sukesh
Bahl v. K. Philips Electronics27and paras 123 to 125 of F .
Hoffman La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd28.In any case the Kudos
stood to gain nothing by suppressing the patent applications
filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), as both
applications had been granted.
(xxxii) Natco’s contention that the suit patent IN’720
suffered from lack of inventive step, as it had not demonstrated
any technical advance of Olaparib over prior art, was contrary
to the very words of Section 2(1) (ja) of the Patents Act, which
defined “inventive step” as meaning “a feature of an invention
that involves technical advance compared to the existing
knowledge orhaving economic significance orboth,and that
makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art”.
272015 SCC OnLine Del 2313
28148 (2008) DLT 598 (hereinafter referred to as “ Roche-II ”)CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 19of69As such, technical advance over prior art is not a mandatory
pre-requisite for an inventive step to be found to be involved in
a patent claim. Economic significance of the product related to
the claim would also suffice to make out an inventive step.
Olaparib definitely possesses economic significance over prior
art. It is sold over 90 countries, used for the treatment of
multiple tumour types, and is a certified blockbuster drug, with
sales revenues of over USD 2.3 billion in 2021. In 2016, the
US FDA had granted “breakthrough therapy” status to Olaparib
for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. The very definition
of a therapy as breakthrough indicated that it possessed
substantial improvement over existing therapy. Mr. Anand
places reliance on literature explaining the concept of a
breakthrough therapy.
(xxxiii) It is only if the suit patent were to lack in inventive
steps, as envisaged by Section 2(1) (ja), that it could be said to
be vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.
Inasmuch as Olaparib could not be said to lack in inventive step
over prior art, the suit patent was not vulnerable to invalidity for
want of obviousness.
(xxxiv) In order to be valid, a claim for patenting an
invention was not required to demonstrate superiority of the
invention over prior art. All that was required to be shown was
that the invention satisfies the test of novelty, non-obviousness
and utility.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 20of69(xxxv) In view of the fact that the genus patent IN’218 did
not contain the teaching to lead a person skilled in the art to
synthesize Olaparib, as the compound claimed in Claim I of the
species patent in IN’720, from the Markush formula claimed in
Claim I of the genus patent, and it was possible to synthesize
Olaparib from the Markush claim in the genus patent only by
cherry-picking the substituents from the several suggested
substitutions in Claim I, and substituting them on the Markush
radicals by employing hindsight reconstruction, it was clear that
the Olaparib could not be said to be disclosed, much less
claimed, in Claim I of the genus patent IN’218.
For all these reasons, among others, Mr. Anand submits that, as the
fact of infringement is indisputable, and as Natco has not succeeded in
setting up a credible challenge to the suit patent, indicating that it is
vulnerable to invalidity, Kudos is entitled to an interlocutory
injunction as sought.
18. Inasmuch as the defendant has, undisputedly, manufactured and
sold generic Olaparib during the life of the suit patent, the fact of
“infringement” of the suit patent by the defendant, as understood
stricto sensu , cannot be disputed either. Mr. Sai Deepak, however,
invokes Section 107, read with clauses (a), (d), (e), (f), (j), (k) and (m)
of Section 64(1) of the Patents Act to defend the charge of
infringement, and the reliefs sought by Kudos on that basis. He also
submits that, for defending an allegation of infringement, andCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 21of69successfully opposing a prayer for interlocutory injunction, a
defendant is only required to put forward a “credible challenge”,
demonstrating the suit patent to be vulnerable to invalidity on one or
the other grounds envisaged by Section 64(1). His submissions,
according to him, meet that standard.
19. To save time and space, I propose to decide this application by
dealing, seriatim, with the various points of defence raised by Mr. Sai
Deepak, vis-à-vis the submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand in that regard.
In doing so, aspects which involve detailed examination of facts and
which, therefore, would merit an exhaustive analysis after both sides
are given an opportunity to lead evidence, are not being addressed,
adhering to the discipline of Astrazeneca-I and Pernod Ricard . I
shall, however, note the said issues towards the conclusion of this
order.
The consideration of credible challenge
20. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that the defendant is only
required to raise a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit
patent in order to succeed in its defence against infringement.
21. There is no dispute about this legal position.
22. However, it is necessary to understand what “credible
challenge” means. In this context, this court has held, in para 19 ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 22of69FMC-II , paras 178 and 231 to 233 of Novartis I and para 129 of
Novartis II thus:
FMC-II
“19.Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity
of the plaintiff's patent need not be such as to demonstrate,
conclusively, the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant
is able to make out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to
revocation under the Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however,
to be demonstrated by way of a credible challenge. The onus would
be on the defendant, therefore, to establish the credibility of the
challenge raised by it. The challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful,
or moonshine. It must not strain the sinews of acceptability. There
can, however, needless to say, be no fixed standard on the basis of
which the credibility of the challenge can be assessed. It would be
for the Court, in each case, therefore, to ascertain, for itself,
whether the challenge raised by the defendant, to the validity of the
suit patent, is, or is not, credible.”
Novartis I
“178 .The challenge in this regard must be credible. Credibility
indicates that, on the face of the challenge, it must merit favourable
consideration. A credible challenge occupies a higher pedestal than
a challenge, which is merely worthy of consideration.
xxxxx
231.Before closing the discussion, I wish to enter a final
observation. There appears, prima facie , to me, to be a fundamental
misconception relating the concepts of a “credible challenge” and
of “vulnerability”. The submissions advanced by the defendant
seem to have been predicated on the premise that the slightest
shadow of doubt, which could be cast on the suit patent, was
sufficient to constitute a credible challenge, exposing its
vulnerability to revocation. This proposition, according to me, is
completely misconceived. Para 28 of the report in Bishwanath
Prasad Radheyshyam recognises the fact that, prior to grant of a
patent, especially for a pharmaceutical product, a thorough study is
normally undertaken by the Patent Office, regarding the validity of
the patent as sought. When an infringer seeks to defend
infringement on the ground that the patent that he infringes is
invalid, the onus, to prove such invalidity heavily lies on him. This
standard has to be met, when applying the principle of
“credibility”. Repeated attempts were made to convince me thatCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 23of69any and every ground that the defendant sought to raise, and for
which a cast iron response from the plaintiff was not immediately
forthcoming, was sufficient to establish vulnerability of the suit
patent to revocation. Revocation is a drastic act, and a patent, once
granted, cannot be treated as easily vulnerable to revocation. Even
if,prima facie , a ground for revocation is made out, as is noted
inMerck v.Glenmark , revocation is not automatic, but remains a
matter of discretion, for the patent authority. The grant of such
discretion is itself a pointer to the legislative intent that, before
revoking a patent, the authority is required to satisfy itself, that, all
considerations having been mould in mind, revocation is absolutely
necessary. Vulnerability to revocation has also to be judged on the
same standard. It is only when, judged on that standard, a credible
challenge to the validity of the patent as vulnerable to revocation is
made out, that an infringer can escape the consequences of
infringement. The standard is, therefore, high, rather than low.
232.This would especially be so in a situation, as in the present
case, the infringer never choose to challenge the suit patent either
at pre-grant or at post-grant stage, by filing oppositions. The
defendants have not, therefore, “cleared the way”, before
exploiting the suit patent. Mr. Sai Deepak sought to contend that,
by deferring the release of their Eltrombopag Olamine, till the
expiry of the term of IN 176, the defendants had sufficiently
cleared the way. Mr. Hemant Singh has disputed this contention,
and I confess that I agree with him. IN 161 was granted as far back
as on 27thMarch, 2009. It has remained in force for 12 years. The
defendants have neither chosen to launch any pre-grant or post-
grant, opposition to IN 161. Nor have they filed any proceedings
before the patent office or the IPAB, to cancel or suspend the
registration granted to IN 161. Rather, even while IN 161 continues
to remain valid, the defendants have, without blinking an eyelid,
sought to exploit the subject matter of the said patent, i.e. EO. That
they have done so with the full awareness that EO is specifically
claimed in IN 161, is not disputed. Clearly, therefore, the
defendants have, by their attitude, as well as by failing to clear the
way before exploiting the suit patent, IN 161, exposed themselves
to an interlocutory injunction.
233.It is only when they have been “caught in the act”, as it
were, that the infringer defendants, unable to dispute the charge of
infringement on facts, seek to question the validity of the suit
patent. While Section 64, undoubtedly, allow them to do so, the
challenge has to be credible, not incredible. The defendants, in the
present case, neither launched any pre-grant nor any post-grant,
opposition to IN 161. They have not initiated any proceedingCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 24of69before IPAB or any other authority, for revocation, cancellation or
removal of the suit patent from the register of patents. In such
circumstances, the holder of the suit patent would ordinarily be
entitled to an injunction against continued infringement. Absent
anyprima facie case of vulnerability of the suit patent to
revocation on the ground of invalidity, therefore, injunction cannot
be refused, once infringement is established.”
Novartis II
“129 .In fact, Natco has, in its submissions, completely glossed
over the most important query which it would have to answer, in
order to set up even a credible challenge to the validity of the suit
patent, vis-à-vis a Markush prior art. The suit patent could be said
to be vulnerable to invalidity, vis-à-vis known Markush prior art,
only if it is established, cumulatively, that
(i) from the known prior art, it is possible to arrive at
the suit patent, by effecting suggested substitutions in the
Markush formula claimed in the prior art, from the
substitutions suggested therein, and
(ii) the Markush prior art contains the requisite teaching,
as would suggest the substitutions which are to be so made
in order to arrive at the suit patent. ”
23. Thus, the onus to establish that the challenge raised by it is
credible, is on the respondent. A credible challenge, as Mr. Pravin
Anand has correctly submitted, is a challenge which is not incredible,
fanciful, or moonshine, and must prima facie be acceptable. On its
face, the challenge must merit favorable consideration. It is not
enough for the defendant to raise a challenge which is worthy of
consideration. The challenge must be more than that; it must partake
of the character of prima facie acceptability. “credibility”, even by
itself, connotes a fairly high standard. In examining whether the
challenge raised is credible, a relevant consideration is the fact that the
Patent Office has, after a thorough study, found the patent to be validCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 25of69and capable of being granted. In Merck , the Division Bench of this
Court held that, even if a ground for revocation of a granted patent
was made out, revocation was not an inevitable sequitur, but that the
patent authority retained discretion in that regard. The same standard
has to be adopted while examining vulnerability to revocation. The
standard of credibility is, therefore, a high standard, not a low
standard, as is commonly understood.
II. The decision in Astrazeneca-I
24. Mr. Sai Deepak laid great stress on the decision in Astrazeneca-
I.According to him, the view taken by this Bench in FMC-II,
Novartis-I and Novartis-II can no longer be followed after the
decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I . As against this, Mr.
Pravin Anand points out that, when the judgment of this Bench in
FMC-II was cited before the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , the
Division Bench did not overrule the decision, but only distinguished it
on the ground that, in FMC-II , only the specie patent was asserted by
the plaintiff whereas, in Astrazeneca-I , both genus and specie patent
were asserted.
25. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that the observation that, in FMC-II ,
the specie patent alone was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I , both
genus and specie patent were asserted, was merely a closing
observation of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , and to accord
that closing observation pre-eminence over all other findings of the
Division Bench would be a lopsided approach. He submits that theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 26of69closing observation regarding the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II
does not dilute the rigour of the rest of the judgment in Astrazeneca-I ,
or take away its precedential value. The findings in the decision, he
submit, apply on all fours to the facts at hand, and are directly
contrary to the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I
andNovartis-II. All those findings cannot, he submit, be overlooked
merely because of the closing observation differentiating the decision
inFMC-II from the facts which were before the Division Bench.
Effect of reference, in Astrazeneca-I , to the decision in FMC-II
26. In so submitting, Mr. Sai Deepak overlooks the fact that, had
the Division Bench felt that the view expressed by this Bench in
FMC-II was wrong, the easiest thing would have to be to overrule it.
Indeed, that would be the only natural course of action which the
Division Bench would ordinarily have followed. The Division Bench
did not, however, do so, and it would, therefore, be overreaching the
decision of the Division Bench if one were to read Astrazeneca-I as
overruling FMC-II. It appears, prima facie , incongruous if an
interpreter of a judgment were, in the process of interpreting, to
rewrite the judgment as doing what the author of the judgment could
have done, but did not choose to do.
27. The Division Bench, therefore, consciously refrained from
overruling the view of this Bench in FMC-II. The words used by the
Division Bench are of stellar significance. The Division Bench
observes:CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 27of69“51. The counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, on 12thJuly, 2021
mentioned the matter, to draw attention to judgment dated 7thJuly,
2021 in applications for interim relief in CS(COMM) No. 69/2021
and CS(COMM) No. 661/2019 titled FMC Corporation v. Best
Crop Science LLP .In taking the view aforesaid, we have
considered the said judgment also, in which infringement of one
patent only was claimed .”
(Emphasis supplied)
28. Nothing, in my considered opinion, could be plainer. The
Division Bench was specifically shown the decision of this Bench in
FMC-II . The Division Bench noted that, in arriving at its view, it had
also considered the decision of this Bench in FMC-II .After
considering the decision of this Bench in FMC-II , the Division Bench
propounded the view that it did, and the identifying and distinguishing
feature of the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II is, clearly, from the
italicised words in para 52 of the report in Astrazeneca-I , the fact that,
inFMC-II , only the specie patent was asserted, whereas, in
Astrazeneca-I , Astrazeneca asserted both the genie and specie patent,
contending that the impugned invention of Intas infringed both
patents . It is because of this distinguishing feature that the Division
Bench in Astrazeneca-I, without disturbing the decision of this Bench
in FMC, held as it did. That much, according to me, is clear from para
52 of Astrazeneca-I.
29. It would, therefore, be folly, according to me, for any
hierarchically subordinate Court, or Bench, to interpret the decision of
the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II , or even
as disapproving the view expressed therein.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 28of69Assuming Mr Sai Deepak’s contention to be correct – Discussion in
main body of the decision in Astrazeneca-I
30. Even if one were to go along with Mr. Sai Deepak’s submission,
and advert to the body of the Astrazeneca-I decision, one finds that
the Division Bench has proceeded almost entirely on the consideration
that Astrazeneca had, in its suit, asserted both the genus and the specie
patents. It is helpful, in this context, to vivisect the Astrazeneca-I
decision into its individual components, as that would help a great
deal in understanding what the Division Bench went on to hold. For
this purpose, the para numbers to which I allude are the para numbers
of the report in the SCC OnLine journal.
31. Astrazeneca, in its suit, asserted two patents; IN 205147 (IN’
147) and IN 235625 (IN’625). On the basis thereof, Astrazeneca
sought an injunction against Intas manufacturing or otherwise dealing
in Dapagliflozin (“DAPA”). The facts of the case are not of much
significance, and are contained in paras 1 to 14 of the report.
32. The Division Bench proceeds, in para 16 of the report, to
enumerate the contentions of learned Counsel for Astrazeneca.
Thereafter, paras 17 to 21, the Division Bench observes thus:
“17. Though ordinarily we would have recorded the arguments
of the counsels for the respondent(s)/defendant(s) also but need
therefor is not felt in the facts of the present case since during the
hearing itself, we entertained doubts/reservations as spelled out
herein below, and which doubts inter alia also form the defence of
the respondent(s)/defendant(s).CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 29of6918. Our doubts stemmed from, the appellants/plaintiffs
averring and pleading manufacture and sale by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA to be in infringement of two
patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. It was felt, that if DAPA was not
disclosed and/or known at the time of seeking patent IN 147 or US
equivalent thereof and was invented only subsequently and patent
thereof obtained in IN 625 or US equivalent thereof, there could be
no infringement by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 by
manufacturing and/or selling DAPA. Conversely, once the
appellants/plaintiffs claimed infringement of IN 147 also, it
necessarily followed that DAPA was subject matter thereof and
once it was the subject matter thereof, how it could be the subject
matter of subsequent patent IN 625 .
19. It was thus enquired from the counsel for the
appellants/plaintiffs, that if the patent IN 147 was/is not of DAPA,
how could the appellants/plaintiffs in the suits from which these
appeals arise, claim infringement by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 also, by manufacturing
DAPA. It was further enquired, whether not from the factum of the
appellants/plaintiffs, in the suits from which these appeals arise,
having claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of
both, IN 147 as well as IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are
deemed to have admitted DAPA as the subject matter of both, IN
147 and IN 625.
20. We, at this stage, spell out the thought process behind the
aforesaid query.
21. In our opinion, with respect to one invention, there can be
only one patent. The appellants/plaintiffs herein however, while
claiming one invention only i.e. DAPA, are claiming two patents
with respect thereto, with infringement of both, by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) .The same alone , in our view, strikes at
the very root of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs and disentitles
the appellants/plaintiffs from any interim relief .”
(Emphasis supplied)
33. Paras 25 to 28, 31, 32, 36, 43 and 45 of the report proceed to
observe thus:
“25. With “invention”, as defined in the statute, forming the
core of a patent and the appellants/plaintiffs in their suits having
claimed only one invention i.e. DAPA, as subject matter of bothCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 30of69the patents, we wondered whether there could be two patents with
respect to the same invention and proceeded to examine the two
patents, to decipher the invention claimed in each.
26. IN 147 sets out the field of invention as under:
“The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which
are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in
the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating
diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X,
diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases,
employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with
one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or
more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents”.
27. IN 625 sets out the field of invention as under:
“The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which
are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in
the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating
diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X,
diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases,
employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with
one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or
more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents”.
28. As would immediately be obvious from above, there is
complete identity, without any difference whatsoever, between the
field of invention as set out in the two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN
625. For IN 625 to be with respect to a ‘new product’ involving an
inventive step i.e. a feature involving a technical advance as
compared to existing knowledge including of IN 147 or having
economic significance and which was not anticipated by earlier
publication or use including of IN 147, to say the least, we
expected the description of the field of invention in IN 625 to
describe the technical advancement and/or the difference in
efficacy, from that in IN 147.
*****
31. The Patents Act, though protects the rights and interests of
inventors, but for a limited period, whereafter the monopoly of the
patentee ceases and comes to an end and the invention with respect
to which patent was granted, falls in public domain i.e. open for allCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 31of69to practice and reap benefit of. A patent, vide Section 48 of the
Act, confers a right on the patentee of a product patent, as DAPA
is, to, during the life of the patent, prevent others from making,
using, offering for sale, selling or importing, the new product with
respect whereto patent is granted. The life of a patent is limited,
whereafter, notwithstanding the new product having been invented
by the patentee, patentee no longer has exclusive right to make, use
or offer for sale the same and anyone else interested can also make,
use or offer for sale the said new product invented by the patentee,
without any interference from the patentee. If patents with respect
to the same invention can be granted more than once, successively
in time, the same will negate the legislative intent of limiting the
life of the patent and enable the patentee to prevent others from
making, using or offering for sale, the new product invented by the
patentee, till the time patentee successively keeps on obtaining
patent therefor.
32. As far as the arguments of the counsel for the
appellants/plaintiffs, of DAPA being only covered and not
disclosed in IN 147 and being disclosed for the first time in IN
625, and of DAPA being not obvious from and capable of being
anticipated from IN 147 are concerned, we are also of the opinion
that once the appellants/plaintiffs, in the plaints in their suits
claimed the action of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of
manufacturing medicines having DAPA as their ingredient to be an
infringement of both IN 147 and IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs
are deemed to have admitted DAPA to be the invention subject
matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Without DAPA being disclosed
in IN 147, there could be no patent with respect to DAPA in IN
147 and which was being infringed by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) by manufacturing drugs/medicines with
DAPA as ingredient.
*****
36. From the aforesaid provisions it follows, that from IN 147
and/or US equivalent thereof, the invention as described therein
could be worked by anyone, save for the exclusivity for the term
thereof in favour of the appellants/plaintiffs. However the claim of
the appellants/plaintiffs is, that DAPA was not disclosed in the
specifications of IN 147 but 80 other compounds were disclosed.
However if that were to be the case, it being not the case of the
appellants/plaintiffs that the respondent(s)/defendant(s) were
manufacturing any of the said 80 compounds, the
appellants/plaintiffs, for manufacture by
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA, cannot claim infringement of
IN 147 and could have claimed infringement only of IN 625 in
which DAPA was disclosed.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 32of69*****
43. However, under the Indian regime, patent is to be sought
and granted with respect to a new product or process. “Product” is
not defined in the Act. The said word is thus deemed to have been
used in the Act, as commonly understood. “Product” is understood
as something that is made to be sold, usually something that is
produced by an industrial process or, less commonly, something
that is grown or obtained through farming. However, the
arguments of the appellants/plaintiffs before us make out IN 147 to
be a discovery/invention of a group of formulations, which was
capable, with further research, of acting as a drug/medicine for
inhibiting re-absorption of sugar in kidneys. The
appellants/plaintiffs, on the basis thereof could not have
manufactured any drug/medicine and have not pleaded any
drug/medicine manufactured post IN 147 and thus it prima
facie appears, could not have restrained any other person who
discovered DAPA, even if from IN 147. In fact we wondered, why
the appellants/plaintiffs have pleaded and claimed infringement by
the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Though
in response to our query aforesaid, we expected the
appellants/plaintiffs to confine their claim for infringement to IN
625 only but the appellants/plaintiffs stuck to their stand of the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) being also in infringement of IN 147. It
is obvious therefrom that the appellants/plaintiffs have no legs to
stand on, by claiming infringement of IN 625 only, without also
claiming infringement of IN 147. However, as held in the
impugned judgment/order dated 2ndNovember, 2020, the question
of the respondent(s)/defendant(s), by working DAPA, infringing
IN 147 could arise only if DAPA was disclosed in IN 147. If
DAPA was disclosed in IN 147, even if better disclosed in IN 625,
cannot enjoy two rounds of 20 years of protection, when the
legislative policy is to grant protection for a period of one term of
20 years only.
*****
45. We, at least at this stage are unable to, in the face of the
aforesaid pleadings of the appellants/plaintiffs themselves, find any
difference between IN 147 and IN 625. The appellants/plaintiffs
themselves are found to be pleading DAPA to have been disclosed
generally in IN 147 and specifically in IN 625. In the face of the
said pleading, no case for injuncting the respondent(s)/defendant(s)
during the pendency of the suits is made out. As aforesaid, we
entertain doubt as to the very basis of the claim of the
appellants/plaintiffs, as noted in the judgment/order dated
2ndNovember, 2020 identifying the key question in the dispute toCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 33of69be “whether the compound-in-issue i.e. Dapagliflozin [in short
“DAPA”] which, according to the plaintiffs, is covered in IN 147
stands disclosed both, in law as well as on facts”.
34. In the face of the afore-extracted passages, it would be facile to
even suggest that the simultaneous assertion, by Astrazeneca, of the
genus patent IN’147 and the species patent IN’625, resulting in the
allegation that the manufacture and sale, by Intas, of dapagliflozin
infringed both the genus and the species patents, did not play a
predominant role in the Division Bench holding as it did. In para 18,
the Division Bench holds that, by simultaneously claiming
infringement of the genus and the species patent, Astrazeneca had
admitted that DAPA was the subject matter of both patents. In para 21,
it is observed, even more significantly, that Astrazeneca was “ claiming
two patents ...with infringement of both ”. This act of Astrazeneca in
claiming both the genus and the species patent through DAPA, and
alleging infringement of both patents by Intas, was found by the
Division Bench to strike at the very root of the claim of Astrazeneca,
disentitling it to any interim relief. The simultaneous assertion by
Astrazeneca of the genus and the species patent, and the consequent
allegation that the manufacturer of DAPA by Intas had infringed both
patents, was found by the Division Bench, in para 32 of the report, to
amount to a deemed admission, by Astrazeneca, that DAPA was the
“invention subject matter” of both the genus and the species patents.
By thus claiming the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas as
infringing the genus and the species patents, the Division Bench
observed that Astrazeneca had impliedly acknowledged the disclosure
of DAPA in the complete specifications both of the genus and theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 34of69species patent. Thus, the act of Astrazeneca, in alleging the
manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing the genus as
well as the species patent, was found to foreclose Astrazeneca from
maintaining any stand that the genus patent did not disclose DAPA.
35. This position is even more prominently underscored in para 36
of the report, in which the Division Bench holds that if the case of
Astrazeneca were that DAPA was not disclosed in the genus patent,
though 80 other compounds were disclosed, DAPA could not have
blamed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas, to be infringing
the genus patent IN’147. Para 39 of the report again emphasizes the
view of the Division Bench, that, if the genus patent IN’147 did not
disclose DAPA, AstraZeneca could not have claimed the manufacture
and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing IN’147. The concluding
observation in para 39 specifically holds that the act of Astrazeneca in
pleading infringement of the genus patent IN’147 as well as the
species patent IN’625 had, at least at the interlocutory stage, to be
treated as an admission, by Astrazeneca, of DAPA being a known
substance, while obtaining the genus patent.
36. Para 43 of the report gives voice to the concern, of the Division
Bench, as to why Astrazeneca had pleaded and claimed infringement,
by Intas, of both the genus and the species patents. Significantly, the
paragraph goes on to observe that, when the Division Bench had
queried Astrazeneca in that regard, it was expected that Astrazeneca
would confine their claim of infringement only to the species patent –
which is what Kudos has done in the present case . The obviousCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 35of69sequitur is that, had Astrazeneca restricted its claim of infringement to
the species patent, instead of alleging infringement of the genus and
species patent both, the outcome of the judgment would have been
different. The submission of Mr. Sai Deepak that the ultimate
decision in Astrazeneca-I would not be different even if Astrazeneca
had asserted only the species patent, instead of asserting genus and
species patents both, is, therefore, clearly unsustainable, in the light of
the observations in para 43 of Astrazeneca-I .
37. The insistence, by Astrazeneca, to continue to plead
infringement by Intas, of the genus patent IN’147 as well as the
species patent IN’625 was found to be defeating the case that
Astrazeneca was seeking to set up.
38. Practically, the entire reasoning of the Division Bench of this
Court in Astrazeneca-I , therefore, revolves around the fact that
Astrazeneca was pleading infringement, by DAPA, of the genus patent
IN’147 as well as the species patent IN’625. This assertion of
simultaneous infringement of both the genus and the species patents
was found to completely defeat the case of Astrazeneca. Perhaps,
most significantly, in para 43, the Division Bench observed that
Astrazeneca might have had a case, had it restricted its claim of
infringement to the species patent, rather than claiming infringement
of both the genus and the species patents.
39. In the present case, there is no dispute that Kudos has claimed
infringement only of the species patent IN’720 and has claimed noCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 36of69infringement of the genus patent IN’218. The above observations of
the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , particularly in conjunction with
the manner in which the Division Bench sought to distinguish the
judgment of this court in FMC-II , clearly indicates that, in a case
where the species patent alone is asserted, and no infringement of the
genus patent is pleaded, the decision in FMC-II would continue to
hold the field.
40. In fact, far from Astrazeneca-I overruling FMC-II, orFMC-II
being no longer good law after the decision in Astrazeneca-I , my
understanding is that, in a case where a species patent alone is
asserted, Astrazeneca-I upholds the decision in FMC-II as
representing the correct legal position. The decision in Astrazeneca-I
having been upheld by the Supreme Court by dismissal of the SLP , in a
case where the species patent alone is asserted, the correct legal
position would be the position taken by this Court in FMC-II .
III. Individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak
41. The individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak
in the present case are all covered by the earlier decisions of this
bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I andNovartis-II . Though appeals may
have been preferred against these decisions, I have not been informed
of any interlocutory order having been passed, staying their operation.
42. I deem it necessary, therefore, only to allude to the relevant
passages from the decisions of this bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I andCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 37of69Novartis-II , which address the issues raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-
visthe facts which arise in the present case, rather than re-analyze the
legal position ab initio .
IV . The coverage v. disclosure conundrum and the challenge on the
ground of obviousness and lack of inventive step – Section 64(1)(f)
43. The aspect of whether coverage and disclosure are the same, or
whether coverage implies disclosure, has to be decided on the basis of
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Novartis AG , as the Supreme
Court has specifically alluded to the point. Howsoever one may
interpret or understand Novartis AG , it is not permissible for any
court, lower in the judicial hierarchy to the Supreme Court, to allow
its judicial peregrinations to take it outside Novartis AG of that
decision, when dealing with the aspect of coverage vis-à-vis
disclosure.
44. InFMC-II , this Court has analyzed the decision in Novartis AG
threadbare, para by para. The conclusion that this Court has arrived is
contained in paras 81 to 84 of the decision, which may be reproduced
thus:
“81.Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis have, in
my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, which
set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, by
learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina.
Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they
necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual
controversy before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced
were general in nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as
contained in paras 118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally
omnibus. What was contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as
recorded in paras 114 and 116 of the report, was that “the scope ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 38of69coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a patent”. This
argument stands reiterated, in the same para (para 116) - “that
coverage that is granted in respect of a patent is not always co-
extensive with what is disclosed in the patent”. In the light of the
Zimmerman invention, learned Senior Counsel contended that “the
patent may be entitled to larger coverage than what is specifically
disclosed in it”. The teaching in the patent, it was contended, lay
“in the disclosure/specification that supports the claim”, which
“describes the invention”. Dealing with these submissions, the
Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that “the
dichotomy… sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on the
one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on
the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale
of the law of patent”. The words “in apatent”, as used by the
Supreme Court, indicated of the intent of the Supreme Court to be
expounding the law in general terms, and not limited to the
Zimmerman patent, or the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare
reading of para 118 of the report in Novartis AG makes it clear that
the Supreme Court has expressed its view with respect to patents in
general. The opening sentence of para 119 of the report is a
proposition couched in absolute terms and, in my respectful
opinion, it would be folly, on the part of this Court, to restrict those
observations to the facts of Novartis AG .
82. According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of
repetition), any dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage
or claim, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent,
struck at the very root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the
Supreme Court has disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any
dichotomy being sought to be drawn between coverage and
disclosure.
83. Having said that, etymologically, “dichotomy” is not the
same as “distinction”. The Supreme Court has not held that
coverage and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is
no distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its
words with precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no
“dichotomy” between “coverage” and disclosure”. “Dichotomy” is
defined, in the Oxford Dictionary, as “a division or contrast
between two things that are or are being represented as being
opposed or entirely different ”. In holding that there can be no
dichotomy between coverage or claim, on the one hand, and
disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the other, the Supreme
Court has not, therefore, held that they are identical. Accepting the
submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require this Court to place, in
the first sentence in para 119 of the report in Novartis AG , the
word “dichotomy” with “distinction” or “difference”. That, I amCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 39of69afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court has, in
disapproving the existence of any “wide gap” between coverage
and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any
dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold
that the concepts were identical.
84. Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus,
would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act,
which make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to
“disclosure”. Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not
envisage the “claim” or “coverage” of the claim, to be identical to
“disclosure”. Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held.
What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court,
by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in
the Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore,
covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not
disclosed by it. Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to
holding that there was complete dichotomy between “coverage”
and “disclosure”, with no connection between the two. It would
amount to holding that, while examining what was disclosed in a
patent, the authority, or the Court concerned, was to remain
oblivious to the coverage of the patent. Such a dichotomy, which
would result in a “wide gap” between coverage and disclosure was,
in terms, disapproved by the Supreme Court. If, however, there
was clear coverage of a product in the claim (as was found to exist
in the Zimmerman Patent, qua Imatinib Mesylate), it would be
difficult for the patent holder to assert, before the Court, that,
despite such coverage, the claim did not disclose the product. That,
in my view, is what Novartis AG holds. It does not pronounce that
coverage and disclosure are identical or synonymous terms, in
patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai Deepak, to that effect
cannot, therefore, be accepted.”
45. It cannot, therefore, be said that coverage is the same as
disclosure or that, by accepting coverage of the impugned product by
the genus patent, the plaintiff also admits disclosure.
46. A bare glance at the Markush structure claimed in Claim I of
the genus patent IN’218, vis-à-vis the chemical structure of Olaparib
as claimed in Claim I of the species patent IN’720, makes it apparentCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 40of69that Olaparib cannot be said to have been disclosed in the genus
patent.
47. Natco’s pleadings in this regard are admittedly to be found in
paras 89 to 106 of the written statement filed by way of response to
the present plaint, which read thus:
“89. The following submissions are made without prejudice to
the foregoing averments as well as subsequently following
submissions under other grounds of revocation.
90. It is submitted that the claims of IN’720 lack inventive step
and/or are obvious in view of the following prior art, when taken
independently or in any combination:

claimed in IN’720. The specific portions of the complete
specification of WO’576 specifically teaches and also categorically
suggests the the specific substitutions in the Markush structure of
WO’576 which result in Olaparib claimed in IN’720. For the
purpose of convenience, the specific portions of the complete
specification of WO’576 are reproduced below:
WO’576 discloses the following compound
wherein
A-B, R Nand RC can be optionally substituted.
Substitution of A-B
Page 5 of the complete specification states the second aspect of the
present invention whereinCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 41of69A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused
aromatic ring
At Page 7 of the complete specification describes aromatic ring as
follows:
The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein in the conventional sense
to refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure
having delocalised n-electron orbitals.
Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:
In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group
comprises a single aromatic ring , which has five or six ring atoms ,
which ring atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulphur , and which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of
these groups include benzene , pyrazine, pyrrole, thiazole,
isoxazole, and oxazole .
Substitution of RC
RCis -CH 2-RL;
Substitution of RL
RLis optionally substituted phenyl
At Page 19 of the description:
RLis preferably a benzene ring , naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3-
benzodioxole , and more preferably a benzene ring
When RLis a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted . The one or
more substituents may be selected from: C 1-7alkyl, more preferably
methyl, CF 3; C 5-20aryl; C 3-20heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably
fluoro ; hydroxy; ether , more preferably methoxy, phenoxy,
benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano ; carbonyl groups , such
as carboxy ester and amido ; amino (including sulfonamide), more
preferably -NH 2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as
morpholino; acylamido including ureido groups, where the acyl or
amino substituent is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally
fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.
On page 15 of the complete specification preferred substituents of
the benzene ring when RLis phenyl is given and includes:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -CCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 42of69(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1and R2are independently amino
substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido
groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH 2, -C(=0)NHCH 3,
-C(=0)N(CH 3)2, - C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and -C(=0)N(CH 2CH 3)2, as
well as amido groups in which R1and R2, together with the
nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic
structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl,
morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and
piperazinocarbonyl.
Substitution of RN
92. The specific disclosures in WO’576 regarding these
particular substitutions provides the teaching, suggestion and
motivation and also makes it obvious for a person skilled in the art
to reach to the desired product i.e., Olaparib claimed in IN’720 .
93. It is pertinent that there is nothing in IN’720 which would
show any technical advancement or economic significance over the
disclosure of WO’576 – given the substantial identity of the
respective disclosures (as outlined above under prior publication
and relied on for purposes of brevity as if reproduced herein).
94. Given that the dosages, the modes of formulation and even
the concentration of active in formulation are identical, IN’720 is
woefully lacking in any material which would show the purported
inventive step of the claims that were granted. It is in fact equally
pertinent that Olaparib, i.e.,Compound 168 of IN’720 actually
lacks supporting disclosure to show that it has the same benefits of
IC50 values or potentiating growth factor values as the remaining
compounds of that document, let alone better values than the
compounds disclosed in WO’576. Simply put, IN’720 lacks any
seed material to support the claim of inventive step over WO’576.
95. It is therefore submitted that IN’720 must be rejected alone
on the ground of lack of inventive step and/or obviousness based
on WO’576 alone.
Teachings of WO 2002/014090
96. Yet another prior art on the basis of which IN’720 lacks
inventive step is WO’090. The details of WO’090 are as follows:

97. The application was published on 20.02.2003 i.e., before
the earliest priority dated of IN’720 and hence, is prior art for
IN’720.
98. The cited prior art relates to the amino phthalazinone
derivatives active as Kinase inhibitors. Page 4 Placitum 16 of
WO’090 states:
The present invention provides a method for treating
diseases caused by and/or associated with an altered
protein kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in
need thereof an effective amount of an amino-
phthalazinone derivative represented by formula (I):
wherein the relevant teaching is as follows:
Ra and Rb are, each independently, a hydrogen atom or a
group,
R2 is a hydrogen atom or it is a group, optionally further
substituted m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3;
R1is hydrogen or an optionally substituted group selected
from
alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl ,
heterocyclyl or
heterocyclylalkylCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 44of69Page 31 placitum 35 defines arylalkyl group as:
arylalkyl group such as, for instance , the benzyl group , by
working
according to conventional methods .
Page 10 placitum 4 further describes the substitution of
benzyl group as:
optionally substituted in any of the free positions by one
or more groups , for instance 1 to 6 groups, selected from:
halogen , nitro, oxo groups (=0) , carboxy, cyano, alkyl,
perfluorinated alkyl, alkenyl alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,
heterocyclyl, a ino groups and derivatives thereof such as,
for instance, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino,
diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido;
carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for
instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino ,
alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino,
alkoxycarbonylamino.
99. The above disclosure of WO’090 not only teaches but
also suggests the specific substitutions described above. For
a person of skill in the art, this also provides the motivation
to try and practice the substitutions taught and suggested in
WO’090 since the cited document also relates to providing
anti-tumour compounds. The difference if any resides in
that WO’090 suggests and additional substitution of an
amino on the benzene ring. There is however, nothing to
suggest that the unsubstituted phthalazinone would be
ineffective or is not preferred. In any event, even this
differential is overcome when WO’090 and WO’576 are
read together – which would provide a phthalazinone
derivative without the additional amino substitution on the
benzene ring. There is sufficient motivation to read the two
documents together since both in essence relate to
phthalazinone derivatives and both purportedly provide
compounds with anti-tumoral activity. When the teaching
of WO’090 is read together with the teachings of WO’576,
there is sufficient, teaching, suggestion and motivation
which renders the claims of IN’720 and in particular
Olaparib obvious for a person of skill in the art. On the
above-mentioned ground, IN’720 lacks inventive step and
is obvious to a person of skill in the art.
Teachings of EP 0289881CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 45of69100. EP’881 relates to 2-aminoalkyl-4-benzyl-1-(2H)-
phthalazinone derivatives and was published on
09.11.1988. It is therefore prior art for IN’720. EP’881
describes compounds which are useful as antiasthmatic,
antiallergic, Paf-antagonistic (Paf = platelet activating
factor, mediator, which triggers asthma inter alia) and
leukotriene-inhibition. The EPO machine-translated copy of
EP’881 is filed in the proceedings.
Page 1 of EP’881 states:
""….a process for preparing basic substituted phthalazinone
of the general formula
in which R1represents an aryl or aralkyl radical optionally
substituted in the nucleus, R2 represents a divalent straight
or branched aliphatic chain having at least 2 and at most 5
carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 denote low molecular weight
alkyl groups which, together with the nitrogen, may be
members of a heterocyclic ring, or their salts or quaternary
ammonium compounds. For these compounds, a
histaminolytic (antihistamine) effect, spasmolytic and local
anaesthetic effect is specified.
The radical R1 is preferably in the 4-position of the phenyl
ring; occurring C1-C6-alkyl groups , C1-C6-alkoxy groups,
alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups can be straight or
branched, in particular these radicals consist of 1-4 or, if
they are unsaturated, of 3-4 C atoms.
If R3 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group, there is at least one
saturated C atom between the unsaturated bond and the
nitrogen. The unsaturated bond is preferably in the 2,3-
position or 3,4-position.
The C3-C8-cycloalkyl radical is in particular the
cyclopentyl radical or cyclohexyl radical.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 46of69If R3 represents a phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical, this may be
mono -,di-or trisubstituted by the stated radicals. The alkyl
part of this phenylalkyl radical preferably consists of one,
two or three C atoms and may optionally also be branched.
The alkylene bridge Alk can be straight or branched and
preferably consists of two, three or four C atoms. If this
alkylene bridge contains Alk a double bond, it is isolated
from the group NR2 R3 if R2 is hydrogen (ie, not
conjugated to this group). Preferably, at least one saturated
carbon atom is located between such a double bond and the
two nitrogen bonds.
Particularly favourable effects have, for example, those
compounds where the radicals R1 to R3, Alk have the
following meanings: R1 = fluorine, chlorine or bromine, in
particular in the 4-position, preferably fluorine in the 4-
position; R2 = C1-C6-alkyl, preferably methyl; R3 =
phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl, optionally substituted as indicated.
The substituents of the phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical are
preferably C1-C4-alkyl groups (in particular methyl) or a
halogen (for example Cl, F) or C1-C4-alkoxy groups (in
particular methoxy groups). The substituents in the phenyl
part of this phenylalkyl radical are preferably in the 2-
position, 3-position, 4-position or 2,4-position. Occurring
alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkanoylamino or alkoxy alkyl
groups may be straight or branched.Alkyl or alkoxy
radicals preferably consist of 1 to 4 C atoms, the alkanoyl
radicals preferably consist of 2 to 4 C atoms.
101. The teachings of EP’881 suggest similar structure of
phthalazinone derivatives and also suggests towards the
substitution of phenyl at R1 which is further substituted
with a halo group (one of which is F) as preferred. Hence, if
such teachings of EP’881 are read with the teachings of
WO’576 and/or WO’090, it clearly suggests and teaches
towards what is claimed as an “invention” IN’720, thus
rendering claims 1 and 2 of IN’720 obvious for a person of
skill in the art. Hence, on the basis of the teachings of
EP’881 read with above cited arts, IN’720 is obvious and
lacks inventive step.
Teachings of WO 2002/090334
102. Another prior art on the basis of which IN’720 lacksCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 47of69inventive step is WO’334. The present Patent has also been
filed by the same entity i.e., Kudos Pharmaceuticals and
even has at least two common inventors.
103. It is respectfully submitted that, on the basis of
specific disclosure in WO’334, IN’720 lacks inventive step.
For the perusal of this Hon’ble court, the specific teachings
of WO’334 which results in the final product claimed in
IN’720 is reproduced herein:
The complete specification at page no. 5 reproduces the
following compound
wherein:
A-B together represent an optionally substituted aromatic
ring One of the RC 1and RC 2is -CH 2-RLand other of RC1
and RC 2is H R Lis optionally substituted Phenyl; and
RNis hydrogen
On page 17 placitum 20 onwards, Further preferences of
substitution is discussed as:
It is preferred that only one of RC1 And RC2 is represented
by -L-R L, and the other of RC1 and R C2is H
On Page 17 Placitum 25
The fused aromatic ring(s) represented by -A-B- preferably
consist of solely carbon ring and thus may be Benzene,
naphthalene and is more preferably Benzene.
On page 17 placitum 31
RN is preferably selected from hydrogen.
On Page 18 placitum 28
RLis preferably C 5-20aryl, and more preferably a benzene
ring, naphthalene, pyridine, 1,3-benzodioxole or furan.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 48of69When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The
one or more substituents may be selected from: C 1-7alkyl,
more preferably methyl, CF 3; C 5-20aryl, C 3-20heterocyclyl;
halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more
preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy;
nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and
amido; amino (including sulphonamide), more preferably -
NH 2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino;
acylamido, including ureido groups, where the acyl or
amino substituents is preferably phenyl, which itself is
optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether;
sulphoxide; sulphone
On Page 14 placitum 8 amido group is explained as:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl,
carboxamide) : -C (=0)NR 1R2, wherein R1and R2are
independently amino substituents, as defined for amino
groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not
limited to, -C(=0)NH 2, -C(=0)NHCH 3, -C(=0)N(CH 3)2, -
C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and -C (=0)N (CH 2CH 3)2, as well as
amido groups in which R1and R2, together with the
nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a
heterocyclic structure as in, for example,
piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl,
thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .
104. It is respectfully submitted that the only difference
that WO’334 shows is the specific substitution of Nitrogen
(N) at RC2. If the teachings of WO’334 are read together
with WO’576, it makes it obvious for the person skilled in
the art to reach Olaparib now claimed in IN’720.
105. It is further submitted that such specific disclosure
regarding the substitutions and the fact that the application
has been filed by the same applicant and have at least 2
common inventors clearly shows that the product claimed
in IN’720 was always within the knowledge of Plaintiff 1
and that the filing IN’720 was an attempt at protecting an
import monopoly and evergreening of patent protection for
Olaparib.
106. On the basis of above disclosures in the above cited
prior arts read alone or in combination, it is respectfully
submitted that IN’720 lacks inventive step and/or is
obvious.”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 49of6948. A bare reading of the afore-extracted paragraphs from the
written statement of Natco indicates that Natco is arriving at chemical
structure of Olaparib, in the case of each of the referred prior art
inventions, by choosing select radicals out of the several suggested
substitutions in the complete specifications of the prior art patents.
There is not a whisper of an averment, in the written statement, to
justify such preferential selection. By way of example, when Natco
picks the amido radical out of a choice of “carbonyl groups, such as
carboxy, ester and amido”, or carbylamino and its alkylcarbylamino
derivative out of a choice of “alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino,
diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups
and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino,
alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino,
alkoxycarbonylamino ”,the written statement does not indicate why
Natco chooses to make that particular choice . Nor does it contain
anything to indicate that the teachings in the suggested prior arts
would lead a person skilled in the art to make that particular
selection . The exercise undertaken by Natco is, therefore, clearly an
exercise of hindsight reconstruction, armed with prior knowledge of
the necessary radicals which are to be substituted onto the Markush
Claim I of the genus patent IN’218 in order to arrive at claim I of the
species patent IN’720, by cherry-picking the appropriate radicals for
substitution. Such hindsight operation, prima facie , demolishes the
plea, of Natco that Claim I in the suit patent is obvious from the genus
patent, or, for that reason, that the species patent is vulnerable to
invalidity on the ground of want of inventive step, under Section
64(1)(f) of the Patents Act.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 50of6949. Indeed, if Olaparib were so obvious from the suggested prior
arts, there is no explanation why it took 19 years, after the genus
patent had been granted, for Natco to synthesize Olaparib. Even as an
old patent, which has weathered 19 years of uninfringed existence,
therefore, the suit patent is entitled to protection.
V . Re. allegation of anticipation by prior claiming – Section
64(1)(a)
48. Section 64(1)(a) has also come up for analyses by this Court in
FMC-II , and paras 107 and 109 to 112 of the said decision may in this
context be thus reproduced:
“107.Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent
already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of
the said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in
the complete specification of another patent granted in India. The
statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for
alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention
claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was
claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier
priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the
complete specification of another patent granted in India (for ease
of reference, “the prior patent”). A defendant who seeks to allege
invalidity, or vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a),
therefore, predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent
was valid. An allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to
any challenge to the validity of the suit patent under Section
64(1)(a). The defendant in the present case, in asserting
vulnerability of IN’307 as having been anticipated by prior
claiming in Claim 22 of IN’978, therefore, has to accede to the
validity of Claim 22 of IN’978.
*****
109.CTPR is the “invention… claimed in Claim 1 of the
complete specification” in IN’307, i.e. the suit patent. The “validCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 51of69claim of earlier priority date” in the prior patent, for the purposes
of Section 64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of
IN’978. Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent
vulnerable if CTPR is, prima facie , claimed in Claim 22 of IN’978.
110.I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is notclaimed,
or even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN’978. Claim 22 of IN’978
claims a Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said
Markush moiety to Claim 1 in IN’307, or to CTPR, only by cherry
picking select radicals out of the innumerable choices provided in
the complete specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN’978, for
substitution on said Markush moiety. Save and except for
demonstrating how, by substituting such select radicals, it is
possible to move from the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN’978
to Claim 1 of IN’307, or to CTPR, the defendant has, in its written
statement, not indicated any teaching or guidance, available in the
complete specifications of IN’278, as would guide a person skilled
in the art to pick the select radicals and substitute them on the
Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN’978, so as to “lead” him to
CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the Markush formula claimed in Claim
1 of IN’307, is obvious from the disclosure provided in Claim 22
of IN’978.
111.The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as
is apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written
submissions filed by the defendant that “Claim 22 of IN’978
encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of
the impugned patent IN’307, thereby rendering the entirety of the
principal claim of IN 307 vulnerable to revocation”. The
correctness of this argument of the defendant appears to be
somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears to be contrary to the
contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words used in Section
13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While advancing this
contention, the defendant has introduced two new concepts, which
find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of “scope” and
“coverage”. Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a claim in the
suit patent “is claimed in any claim of any other complete
specification”. It does not make any reference either to the scope of
the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required
therefore, prima facie , is comparison of the claims, not whether the
claim in the suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the
claim in the genus patent. This position is also conceded by the
defendant, in its written submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily,
a challenge of anticipation by prior claiming has to be decided on a
claim-to-claim comparison. The defendant would seek to contend
that, in the present case, this exercise is obviated because of the
admission - as the defendant would perceive it - by the plaintiff, inCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 52of69its plaint and replication, of the coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of
IN’978. No such admission is, as already held here in before,
discernible from the paragraphs on which the defendant seeks to
place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, even as per the
defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine the
applicability of Section 64(1)(a) - or, for that matter, Section
13(1)(b) - to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when
undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these
provisions apply.
112.The defendant has made a strained effort to justify
invocation of Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if
Claim 1 in IN’307 includes variants which were outside the scope
of Claim 22 in IN’978, the former claim was, nonetheless,
rendered prima facie vulnerable to the extent it fell within the
scope of Claim 22 of IN’978, i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR.
Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor Section 64(1)(a), in my considered
opinion, lends itself to such an interpretation. All that these
provisions require the Court - or authority before whom the
challenge to the validity is raised - to do is to assess whether the
invention, insofar as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or
was not, claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is
notclaimed in Claim 22 of IN’978. The highest that the defendant
can assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an
arthropodicidal anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush
coverage of Claim 22 of IN’978. In the discussion here in before, I
have already opined that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot
be that CTPR has been claimed in Claim 22 of IN’978.”
49. As has been correctly contended by Mr. Pravin Anand, a plea of
vulnerability of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior
claiming can successfully be raised only if the claim in the suit patent
has been claimed in a patent of an earlier priority date. There must,
therefore, be identity of claims . Para 16 of the written submissions
filed by Mr. Sai Deepak, it is asserted, in this regard, thus:
“16. From the above it is clear that anticipation by prior claiming
u/Sec. 64(1)(a) is dependent on reasonable construction of the
claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product but
is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the
complete specification. After all, what the patentee can assert
against third parties in the form of a sword must be equally
available to the third parties as a shield to defend themselvesCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 53of69against the patentee’s claim of infringement. Any other
interpretation of the statutory scheme would defeat the manifest
legislative intent and that too in a critical realm such as the
pharmaceutical industry. The concept of enabling disclosure may at
best be applicable with respect to the ground of anticipation by
prior publication, but not in the context of anticipation by prior
claiming since Sec. 64(1)(a) is meant to act as a fetter on the
patentee’s ability to evergreen its right to sue based on the claim
and is therefore not contingent on the scope or specificity of the
disclosure. Therefore, to apply the test of enabling disclosure in the
context of 64(1)(a) is to foist on it one of the possible standards
which may be applicable to Sec. 64(1)(e).”
50. The assertions in the afore-extracted passage from the written
submissions of Mr. Sai Deepak, in my view, is based on a
fundamentally erroneous legal premise.
51. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that a claim of vulnerability of
the suit patent to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior
claiming “is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to
assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product, but is in no
way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the complete
specification”. It is further sought to be contended that specificity of
disclosure may be a relevant test for Section 64(1)(e), but cannot be
regarded as a relevant test for Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act.
52. The view expressed by me in FMC-II , as already extracted
hereinabove, compels me to disagree with Mr. Sai Deepak’s
submissions. In my view, Section 64(1)(a) is clear and categorical in
the words it uses. It states that the invention, so far as claimed in the
suit patent, has to have been claimed in a valid claim of earlier
priority date for the suit patent to be regarded as vulnerable toCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 54of69invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming. There has,
therefore, to be identity of claims. The claim asserted in the suit
patent, must have been claimed in a complete specification relating to
a patent of earlier priority date. Then, and only then, can a plea of
invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming be
successfully laid.
53. A claim is even more specific than a disclosure. On a plain
claim to claim comparison, it is clear that Olaparib, as Claim I in the
suit patent IN’720, has never been claimed in any earlier patent to
which Mr. Sai Deepak draws attention. The Markush structure
claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN’218 certainly cannot be said
to claim Claim I in the suit patent IN’720. As such, no prima facie
case of anticipation by prior claiming can be said to exist.
Reliance on Form 27s, PTE applications by Kudos in Australia and
Korea and Eurasian patent EU 006300 and Russian patent RU
2755865
54. Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to place reliance on the Forms 27
filed by Kudos in respect of IN’720 and IN’218, the PTE applications
filed by Kudos in Australia and Korea and the identity of the Eurasian
and Russian equivalents of alleged identity of the claims in Russian
patent RU’865 with the claims in IN’720.
55. I do not see how this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC, can delve into such depth of
detail. It is true, this Court has, in earlier decisions, done so.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 55of69However, in view of the note of caution sounded by the Supreme
Court in Pernod Ricard , I am of the opinion that some kind of rethink
is necessary on this aspect. There is no denying the fact that orders on
applications filed in pharma patent cases for interim relief often go
into such depth of details that practically nothing remains for
adjudication in the suit. This may not be an acceptable way of
proceeding.
56. Particularly when dealing with a challenge to the validity of the
suit patent on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, once the
Court finds, on facts, by claim to claim comparison, that there is no
anticipation by prior claiming, statements made in other jurisdictions,
or in documents filed by the plaintiffs elsewhere, cannot make out a
case of anticipation by prior claiming, even at the prima facie stage.
ought not to legitimately form part of the consideration. The plaintiffs
would have, during the course of trial, every opportunity to explain
the circumstances in which such statements were made, and before
grant of such opportunity, where a prima facie clear case of lack of
anticipation of prior claiming is made out, the matter must rest there,
when dealing with an Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications.
57. I have nonetheless reproduced, in this regard, the defence raised
by Mr. Anand to the various points raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, and for
the purposes of adjudicating the present Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2
applications, suffice it to state that the challenges have not been left
unanswered. The response by Mr. Praveen Anand raises, at the very
least, triable issues. When, on a claim to claim comparison, no case ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 56of69anticipation of prior claiming is found to exist, it cannot be said that
the defendant has raised a credible challenge on that ground.
VI. Re. Anticipation by prior publication – Section 64(1)(e)
58. Anticipation by prior publication has also been dealt with, by
this Bench, in its decisions in FMC-II andNovartis I . Paras 117 to
118, 124 to 128 and 133 of FMC-II and para 222 of Novartis I may,
in this context, be reproduced thus:
From FMC-II
“117 .Section 64(1)(e) states where the invention, so far as
claimed in the suit patent, is not new, having regard to either (i)
what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the
priority date of the claim in the suit patent or (ii) what was
published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to
in Section 13. Unlike Section 64(1)(a), therefore, which is a self-
contained provision, Section 64(1)(e) refers us back to Section 13.
Sub-sections (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13 are relevant, and maybe
reproduced thus:
“13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and
by prior claim -
(1) The examiner to whom an application for a patent is
referred under section 12 shall make investigation for the
purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as
claimed in any claim of the complete specification -
(a) has been anticipated by publication before the date
of filing of the applicant's complete specification in any
specification filed in pursuance of an application for a
patent made in India and dated on or after the 1stday of
January, 1912;
*****
(2) The examiner shall, in addition, make investigation
for the purpose of ascertaining, whether the invention, so
far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification,
has been anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere in
any document other than those mentioned in subsection (1)CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 57of69before the date of filing of the applicant's complete
specification.”
118.Whether under clause (1)(a) or (2), what Section 13
requires is publication of the invention, claimed in the suit patent,
in any document, before the date of filing of the complete
specification in the suit patent.
xxxxx
124.Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words “that the invention so
far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not
new”. This necessarily refers us back to the definition of “new
invention” in clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning “any invention or
technology which has not been anticipated by publication in any
document or used in the country or elsewhere in the world before
the date of filing of patent application with complete specification,
i.e., the subject matter has not fallen in public domain or that it
does not form part of the state of the art”. “Anticipation”, when
used in the Patents Act, has its own peculiar legal connotation.
Though “anticipation”, per se , is not separately defined, Section 13
provides for anticipation only by prior publication or by prior
claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability of a patent to
revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior publication. In
order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute the basis for
revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary that,
consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer “new”;
which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its
character as a “new invention”, by reason of anticipation by prior
publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two
indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication
and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a “new
invention”. This is counterbalanced by the definition of “new
invention”, which envisages absence of novelty either on account
of anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in
the present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior
use of the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case
having been pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss
of novelty on the ground of anticipation by prior publication.
125.Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly
- and significantly - worded. The words “before the priority date of
the claim” succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words “what
was publicly known or publicly used in India”. No such caveat as
to time follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with
publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred
to in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated,CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 58of69in Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of
novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date
of the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the
priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in
India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section
13. Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the
invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to
in Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit
patent . The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit
patent, does not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the
manner in which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the
legislature.
126.That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of
prior publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e),
is completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem . What, then,
is the terminus ad quem , for the purposes of prior publication under
Section 64(1)(e)? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to
provide a terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e),
which deals with the prior publication, apparently because this part
of the clause is to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which
provides the appropriate terminus ad quem , in clauses (1)(a) and
(2), which have already been reproduced hereinabove, and which
envisage anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad
quem provided in respect of anticipation by prior publication, in
clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13, is the “date of filing of the
applicant's complete specification”, and not the priority date of the
suit patent . The priority date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima
facie irrelevant for the purposes of vulnerability on the ground of
anticipation by prior publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with
Section 13 of the Patents Act. What has to be seen is whether, prior
to the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit
patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in the present case , was published
in India or elsewhere in any document.
127.Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an
invention without disclosure of the invention in the patent?
128.Publication involves making known to the public the patent
application. Every application is required to disclose the invention
for which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents
Act4(already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in
the complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention,
its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed,
but also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which
protection is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to beCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 59of69able to successfully allege that CTPR was published in US’424 and
US’357 (being the US equivalent of EP’508), the defendant would
have to establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents.”
xxxxx
133. Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR.
Besides, they are pharmaceutical patents, relating to
pharmaceutical products for therapeutic administration. There is
also substance in Mr. Sethi's contention that these are also Markush
claims, and cannot, therefore, be said to “teach” synthesising of
CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to convince myself that CTPR
stands claimed, or disclosed, in these patents. Sans any claim or
disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that CTPR was published
either in US’424 or US’357 (or, therefore, in EP’508).”
From Novartis-I
“222. Section 64(1)(e) envisages, as a ground for revocation of a
patent, “that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the
complete specification is not new, having regard to what was
publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of
the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of
the documents referred to in Section 13”. The plea of vulnerability
of the suit patent IN 161 on the ground of anticipation by prior
publication, as advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak, is predicated on the
latter half of this Clause. Section 64(1)(e) refers back to Section
13. Anticipation by publication finds reference in Clauses (1)(a)
and (2) of Section 13. Section 13(1)(a) refers to anticipation by
publication of the applicant's complete specifications in any
specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made
in India and does not, therefore, apply to the ground taken by Mr.
Sai Deepak. Section 13(2) refers to anticipation by publication of
the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
specification, by publication in India or elsewhere in any document
before the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit
patent. The use of the expression “so far as claimed”, in Section
13(2) would, therefore, require identity in the extent of claim
contained in the specification in the suit patent and in the
specification of the prior art which is cited for the purpose of
alleging anticipation by prior publication.”
59. In para 126 of FMC-II , this Bench has clearly rejected Mr. Sai
Deepak’s contention that the terminus ad quem for determining
anticipation by prior publication is the priority date of the suit patent.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 60of69It is held, in the said para, that the priority date of the suit patent is
prima facie irrelevant, while examining vulnerability on the ground of
anticipation by prior publication and that, when Section 64(1)(e) is
read with Section 13 of the Patents Act, what has to be seen is
whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification of the
suit patent, the asserted invention was published in India or elsewhere
in any document.
60. Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the genus patent WO
2002/36576 (WO’576), equivalent to IN’218 to contend that Claim 1
in the suit patent, i.e. Olaparib, stands anticipated by prior publication
in WO’576. He relies, for this purpose, on Compound 278 in
WO’576, and the process of its synthesis as reflected in the complete
specifications in WO’576.
61. It is obvious at a bare glance that the product compound 278 is
not Olaparib.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 61of6962. Para 83 of the written statement sets out, in a tabular fashion,
the manner in which WO’576 allegedly anticipates, by prior
publication, Olaparib:
WO’576 IN’720
WO’576 discloses the following
Compound
wherein A-B, R Nand R Ccan be
optionally substituted.
Page 4 of the description states the second
aspect of the present invention wherein A
and B together represent an
optionallysubstituted, fused aromatic

RLis optionally substituted phenyl; and
RNis hydrogen.

limitedto, -C(=0)NH 2, -C(=0)NHCH 3, -
C(=0)N(CH 3)2, -C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and-
C (=0)N (CH 2CH 3) 2, as well as
amidogroups in which R1and R2,
togetherwith the nitrogen atom to which
theyare attached, form a
heterocyclicstructure as in, for
example,piperidinocarbonyl,
morpholinocarbonyl,
thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and
piperazinocarbonyl .
Substitution of RN
RNis hydrogen.
The substitution at the place of R N(in
IN’218) is Hydrogen (H) as stated in the
claim of IN’218CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 64of6963. It is clear, from a bare glance at the manner in which Natco has
arrived at the chemical structure of Olaparib from Claim I in WO’576
that there has been cherry picking of substituents. For example,
(i) in the A-B radical in the WO’576 claim, there is no
explanation for why the example of benzene has been selected
out of the possible substituents of 5- to 6- membered aromatic
rings, out of
(a) benzene,
(b) pyrazine,
(c) pyrrole,
(d) thiazole,
(e) isoxazole and
(f) oxazole,
which, too, are merely mentioned as examples, and
(ii) in the -CH 2-RLsubstitution, while the description of
WO’576 does state that R L, if a benzene ring, is preferably
substituted, there is no explanation for why the halo and
carbonyl substituents should be selected in preference to
(a) C1-7alkyl (more preferably methyl),
(b) CF 3,
(c) C5-20aryl,
(d) C3-20heterocyclyl,
(e) hydroxy,
(f) ether (more preferably methoxy, phenoxy,
benzyloxy and cyclopentyloxy),
(g) nitro, and
(h) cyano,CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 65of69among others. Most significantly, perhaps, there is no teaching, in any
of the cited prior arts, to lead a person skilled in the art to envision the
terminal
 cyclopropane substitution.
64. No other prior publication, which publishes Olaparib, has been
cited by Mr. Sai Deepak either during oral arguments or in written
submissions.
65. No case for anticipation by prior publication is also, therefore,
made out.
VII. Section 3(d)29
66. Mr. Sai Deepak has also sought to invoke Section 3(d) of the
Patents Act to contend that the specifications for Olaparib do not
contain any data to indicate enhanced efficacy over the prior art
IN’218.
67. The fallacy of the submission is obvious. Section 3(d), to the
extent it is at all relevant to the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, applies
only to “new forms” of “known substances”. It cannot be said that
293. What are not inventions . – The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -
*****
(d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the
enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any new property or
new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless
such known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.
Explanation . – For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs,
metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and
other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, unless they
differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacyCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 66of69Olaparib is a new form of the Markush Claim I in IN’720. The
submission, therefore, merits prima facie rejection.
VIII. Section 64(1)(m) read with Section 830
68. On the ground that, while applying for and obtaining the suit
patent, Kudos did not disclose the fact that its applications for grant of
the same patent JP 2006-505955 and JP 2007-226723 were facing
rejection. This, in my opinion, cannot be a basis, in any case, for
Kudos to be regarded as disentitled to an injunction. At the very least,
the matter would be a question of fact, to be decided on the facts of
each individual case.
69. Besides, Section 8 requires the patent applicant in India, who is
prosecuting an application for a patent in another country outside
India in respect of the same invention, to file, along with his
application, a statement setting out the particulars of the application.
The issue of whether, in a case where the patent is registered, or being
prosecuted, in several other jurisdictions, the omission to mention the
308. Information and undertaking regarding foreign applications .—
(1) Where an applicant for a patent under this Act is prosecuting either alone or jointly with
any other person an application for a patent in any country outside India in respect of the same or
substantially the same invention, or where to his knowledge such an application is being prosecuted
by some person through whom he claims or by some person deriving title from him, he shall file
along with his application or subsequently within the prescribed period as the Controller may
allow—
(a) a statement setting out detailed particulars of such application; and
(b) an undertaking that, up to the date of grant of patent in India he would keep the
Controller informed in writing, from time to time, of detailed particulars as required
under clause ( a) in respect of every other application relating to the same or substantially
the same invention, if any, filed in any country outside India subsequently to the filing of
the statement referred to in the aforesaid clause, within the prescribed time.
(2) At any time after an application for patent is filed in India and till the grant of a patent or
refusal to grant of a patent made thereon, the Controller may also require the applicant to furnish
details, as may be prescribed, relating to the processing of the application in a country outside India,
and in that event the applicant shall furnish to the Controller information available to him within
such period as may be prescribed.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 67of69proceedings before one jurisdiction would invalidate the granted
patent altogether is, in my prima facie view, highly arguable. Even
more arguable would be the question of whether, if the omission is
bona fide , the patentee, whose patent is admittedly infringed, can be
refused an interim injunction.
70. In the present case, Kudos has placed, on record, documents,
including correspondences with its patent agent, which, according to
it, indicate that the omission to mention the Japanese patents was not
deliberate, but was an inadvertent omission on the part of the patent
agent. How far this argument would be acceptable is, in my view, a
matter which would have to await trial. In any event, in view of the
explanation, this cannot be regarded as so overwhelming a factor as
would justify rejection of the interim relief that Kudos seeks.
IX. The sequitur
71. As already noted towards beginning of this judgment, several
incidental contentions were raised, including IC 50 values, dosage
data, anti-cancer PARP inhibition data, and the like, all of which
would require a detailed excursion into facts. It would not be justified
for this Court to enter into all these areas, once a prima facie case has
been found to exist in favour of the plaintiff. For the purposes of the
present application, it is admitted, in the first place, that the defendant
is in fact exploiting the suit patent by manufacturing and selling
Olaparib. It is also admitted that this exploitation has take place in
the 19thyear of the life of the suit patent. No credible case ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 68of69vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on any of the grounds
contained in Section 64 of the Patents Act can be said to have been
made out by the Natco. As no credible challenge to the validity of the
suit patent has been made out, the prayer for interlocutory injunction
has necessarily to be granted.
Conclusion
72. For all the aforesaid reasons, the present application succeeds
and is allowed. The defendant shall stand restrained from
manufacturing and selling, or in any manner, dealing with Olaparib,
either under the brand name BRACANAT or under other brand name,
pending disposal of the present suit, so long as the suit patent
continues to remain alive and subsisting.
73. I.A. 907/2023 is allowed accordingly.
IA 153/2023 in CO (Comm. IPD-PAT) 1/2023
74. By this application, Natco seeks an interlocutory injunction
staying the operation of the suit patent and restraining Kudos from
seeking any injunction against Natco exploiting the suit patent.
75. No separate submissions have been advanced in this
application. In any event, the outcome of I.A 907/2023 in CS (Comm)
29/2023 would necessarily also determine the outcome of the present
applications.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 69of6976. Resultantly, I.A. 153/2023 is dismissed.

I.A. 907/2023 in CS(COMM) 29/2023

1. Kudos Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Kudos hereinafter) is the registered proprietor of Indian Patent IN 228720 (IN 720) (hereinafter referred to as the suit patent), issued on 12 March 2004 for a period of 20 years. The patent certificate was granted for an invention entitled Phthalazinone derivative. 

2. Claim I of the suit patent read thus:

1.	A Phthalazione derivative of the following formula.


 	Or isomers, salts or solvates thereof.

3. The application for grant of Suit Patent was filed in India on 31 August 2005 with a priority date of 12 March 2003. It was granted by the Indian Patent Office (IPO) on 10 February 2009.

4. There has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit patent. It is only after the present suit was filed that the defendant Natco Pharma Limited (Natco hereinafter) filed CO (COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 under Section 64(1)1 of the Patents Act, 1970 (1970), seeking revocation of the suit patent.

5. The compound claimed in Claim I of the suit patent has been assigned the IUPAC name Olaparib.

6. There is no dispute that, even while the suit patent continues to remain alive and subsisting, Natco has manufactured and sold its own generic version of Olaparib under the brand name BRACANAT.

7. This, contends Kudos, amounts to infringement of the suit patent. Kudos has, therefore, instituted the present suit before this Court seeking a decree of permanent injunction, restraining Natco from manufacturing or selling or otherwise dealing with any product with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or otherwise.

8. Olaparib, it may be noted, is an oral poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, used for treating various forms of cancer.  It is stated that, by inhibiting PARP, Olaparib preferentially kills cancer cells.  The mechanics by which Olaparib acts as an anti-cancer drug are not of particular significance, insofar as the present decision is concerned.

9. Along with the suit, the plaintiff has filed IA 907/2023 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from manufacturing or selling Olaparib, under any brand name, pending disposal of the present suit.
	
10. This judgment disposes of the said IA 907 of 2023 and I.A. 153/2023 in C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023.

A prefatory note

11. In para 15 of the report in Astrazeneca v. Intas2, the Division Bench of this Court has entered the following cautionary note, in the matter of passing of interlocutory orders in intellectual property matters:
15. 	Supreme Court, in order dated 16th August, 2017 in Civil Appeal No. 18892/2017 titled AZ Tech (India) v. Intex Technologies (India) Limited, commented on the disturbing trend, of the orders of disposal of applications for interim relief in Intellectual Property Rights matters governing parties for a long time, with exhaustive judgments, virtually on merits of the suit, being written and expressed the need for addressing the said malady. In fact, suo moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8/2017 titled Re : Case Management of Original Suits, was initiated in pursuance to the said order and in which proceedings this Court informed the Supreme Court of the remedial measures being taken.


12. More recently, the Supreme Court, in Pernod Ricard India Pvt. Ltd. v. United Spirits Ltd3, echoed the above sentiment in the following words:
At the insistence of counsel for the petitioner, we clarify that it is well settled proposition of law that decisions on interlocutory applications are only made to protect rival interests pending suit. Somehow the interim applications itself are treated as final decision but it is not so. In all such cases, interim arrangements should be made and the trial should proceed rather than to spend time only on interlocutory applications. That protects the petitioner against the apprehension that the impugned judgment may be cited in other Court qua petitioners cases of a similar nature.

13. The present order is passed on an interlocutory application under Order XXXIX of the CPC.  All that the Court has to see, therefore, is whether there is a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff, whether the refusal of interim relief would result in irreparable loss to the plaintiff, and which way the balance of convenience would lie.  A threadbare analysis of the entire dispute, and findings which partake of a final expression of opinion on all issues in controversy, is neither justified, nor even appropriate, at this stage.  

14. Arguments in this case extended over several days.  Written submissions have also been tendered by both sides, with the submissions of the plaintiff extending to 53 pages.  If I were to return findings on every issue argued, and on every plea urged, hardly anything would survive for consideration in the suit.  

15. The attempt is, therefore, to ensure that this order conforms to the discipline of Order XXXIX of the CPC.

Rival Contentions

16. I have heard Mr. Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Kudos, and Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the Natco at exhaustive length. 

Submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand

17. Mr. Pravin Anand advanced the following submissions to justify his prayer for interlocutory injunction:

(i) Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in Claim  I of the suit patent IN720.

(ii) During the life of the suit patent and till the filing of C.O. (COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023, there has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit patent, which stands granted in as many as 61 countries.

(iii) The first act of infringement of the suit patent, by Natco, has taken place when the suit patent is in the 19th year of its life.  The suit patent is, therefore, an old patent and is, therefore, prima facie entitled to be treated as valid, strong and liable to be enforced against third party infringers. 

(iv) Olaparib was also covered by IN 245218 (IN218) registered in favor of the plaintiff which expired on 25 October 2021 titled Substituted Benzyl Phthalazinones. 

(v) Claim I in IN720 was as under :
WE CLAIM: 
  A compound of the formula : 

    


Or an isomer, salt, solvate, chemically protected form, and prodrug thereof, wherein :
A and B together represent an optionally mono-substituted, fused aromatic ring: Rc is -CH2-RL;
RL is phenyl substituted by a substituent selected from the group consisting of :
C3-20 heterocyclyl; esler; amido; ureido; sulfonamino; and acyloxy and optionally further substituted; and 
RN is hydrogen.

This is a Markush claim which covers, depending on the selected substitutions from the suggested substitutions provided in the claim, a large number of compounds  worked out in the written submission of the plaintiff as in the range of 93600 million.  This figure is not disputed by Natco.  One among these is Olaparib. 

(vi) Thus, IN218 neither claims nor discloses Olaparib. Olaparib is merely one of the millions of compounds which fall within the broad Markush coverage of Claim I in IN218. 

(vii) The specifications in IN218 do not contain the necessary teaching to guide a person skilled in the art to synthesize Olaparib.

(viii) Natco is admittedly manufacturing and selling Olaparib.  Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in the suit patent IN720.  The fact that Natco is infringing the suit patent, therefore, stands admitted. 

(ix) Natco has not cleared the way before infringing the suit patent.  It has not filed any pre or post grant opposition to the suit patent. C.O. (COMM.) IPD-PAT 1/2023 has also been filed by Natco only after the present suit was instituted by Kudos. The very fact that Natco chose to launch its own generic version of Olaparib, admittedly infringing the suit patent, without, in the first instance, clearing the way, entitles Kudos to interlocutory injunction. 

(x) Clearing the way, moreover, would require Natco not to just to file a revocation petition challenging the suit patent, but also to succeed in its challenge.  For the proposition that the very act of infringing of the suit patent without Natco having first clear the way entitles Kudos to an interim injunction, Mr. Anand relies on para 87 of the report in Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals4 passed by the Division Bench of this Court, the decision of the UK High Court Actavis v.  Lilly5 and on the decision of the UK Court of Appeal in Novartis AG v. Hospira6.

(xi) While it is true that, to justifiably oppose a prayer for interim injunction, the defendant in a patent infringement suit is only required to set up a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent, it cannot be said that Natco has set up such a challenge.  

(xii) In F. Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla Ltd7 and Intex Technologies (India) Ltd.  v. Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson8, a credible challenge has been identified as one which is strong, and which is not fanciful or moonshine.   In assessing whether a challenge is credible, the Division Bench in both these decisions has held that the fact that the inventor had been granted a patent for his invention after thorough scrutiny by the Indian Patent Office was a relevant factor which had to be accorded due weightage. 

(xiii) The fact that no pre-grant or post-grant opposition had been filed to the suit patent, till Natco decided to file a revocation petition in the 19th year of the life of the suit patent is also a recognition of the validity of the suit patent and a factor which entitles Kudos to interim injunction, applying the law laid down by the House of Lords in American Cyanamide v. Ethicon Ltd9. 

(xiv)  On the erroneous presumption that coverage implies disclosure, Natco was seeking to incorrectly contend that Olaparib stood disclosed in IN218.  In actual fact, coverage and disclosure are distinct and different concepts. Coverage does not imply disclosure. The fact that coverage and disclosure are different and distinct stand acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Novartis AG v. UOI10  as well as by the Division Bench of Court in para 11.18.7 of its decision in FMC Corporation v. Natco Pharma Ltd.11 and by this Bench in Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd12.

(xv) Disclosure of a chemical compound in a patent is done only through an individual identification of that compound in the patent document by its chemical name, chemical structure, chemical formula, IUPAC name etc.  Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on paras 283 and 329 of the judgment of the Federal Court of Australia in Eli-Lilly and Co. Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd.13 

(xvi) In FMC-I, the Division Bench held that disclosure of a compound in a genes patent cannot be presumed. 

(xvii)  The Supreme Court, in its judgment in Biswanath Prasad v. Hindustan Metal Industries14  and the US Court of Appeals in Fujikawa v. Wattanasin15 hold that the issue of disclosure of a patent in specifications is a question of fact, which has to be proved by clear and convincing evidence. 

(xviii) There is a difference between coverage and claiming.  The fact that Olaparib is covered under the overall Markush claim in IN218 does not result in Olaparib being vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming. 

(xix) In order for a claim in a patent to be invalided on the ground of prior claiming, the invention in the two claims must be identical. The Markush Claim I in IN218 is clearly different from Claim I in the suit patent which specifically claims and discloses Olaparib. This has been sought to be demonstrated thus:


In the genus patent IN218, though millions of compounds could be synthesized from the Markush Claim I, only 265 compounds were exemplified, and Olaparib was not one amongst them.  In order for a claim in a species patent to be invalidated on the ground of prior claim in the genus patent, the disclosure in the genus patent must be enabling; in other words, it must enable a person skilled in the art to arrive at the species patent from the teachings which it provides. Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on The General Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd.16 

(xx) There can be no question of double patenting or prior claiming where the scope of earlier and later patent is different. 

(xxi) In order to support his contention that the mere coverage of the claim in the species patent, in the overall Markush structure in the genus patent does not invalidate the species patent on the ground of prior claiming, Mr. Anand relies on para 63.2 to 63.6 of Novartis-I, paras 12.5, 12.7 & 12.18 of the judgment of this Bench in FMC Corporation v. Best Crop Science LLP17 and paras 191, 192 and 195 of Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd.18, paras 10.5 to 10.8 of Astrazeneca v. Torrent19 and paras 26 to 30 of the Judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in Dr. Reddys Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly and Co. Ltd20.  

(xxii) If Natcos submissions were to be accepted, it would invalidate all selection patents, which are recognized in this country.  Natco was seeking to contend that all species patents were patents of addition under Section 3421 and had, therefore, necessarily to terminate with the genus patent.  This was a seriously flawed submission, and went against the well-recognized theory of selection patents. Selection patents were valid subject to their satisfying the three factor test, postulated in Re. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.s Patents22, followed by this Court in its decision in FMC-I.

(xxiii) The suit patent could not be treated as a patent of addition under Section 5423 of the Patents Act, as was sought to be contended by Natco.  A patent of addition was filed with respect to minor improvements over an invention described or disclosed in an earlier patent. Olaparib is neither described nor disclosed in the genus patent IN218. Moreover, Olaparib was not a mere improvement over the genus patent but constitutes an entirely new invention. 

(xxiv) The reliance on Section 53(4)24 of the Patents Act, by Natco is also misplaced. Natco was seeking to contend that, by operation of Section 53(4), the expiry of the genus patent IN218 resulted ipso facto in falling, into the public domain all subject matter covered by the genus patent even if it was neither claimed nor disclosed in it.  This was a fundamentally misplaced submission. The protection available under Section 53(4) was as much available to the species patents as to the genus patent.  It is well-settled that multiple patents can cover the same product. In such a case, the expiry of genus patent does not result automatically into expiry of the species patents or evisceration of the protection available under Section 53(4) to the species patent. 

(xxv)  This was clear from the expression notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, with which Section 53(4) commences. The Patents Act could not be treated as other law for the purposes of Section 53(4). While, therefore, Section 53(4) had supervening application over other laws, it was nonetheless subject to the Patents Act and, especially, to Sections 19, 91(1) and 141 (1) thereof.  Reliance was placed, for the interpretation any other law on the judgment of the Supreme Court in P. Virudhachalam v. Management of Lotus Mills25 . The correct interpretation to be placed on Section 53 (4) was, therefore, that all compounds disclosed by the genus patent would be open to the public upon its expiry. Inasmuch as Olaparib was not specifically disclosed in the genus patent IN218, the expiry of IN218 did not render Olaparib available in the public domain for anyone to exploit.  

(xxvi)   A plea that Olaparib was disclosed in the Russian Genus Patent RU865 was also incorrect. Natco was seeking to contend that RU865  which was the Russian equivalent to IN218  also claimed a medicament used to treat cancer via PARP inhibition. The reliance on RU865 was, however, misplaced as RU865 did not disclose that any drug, let alone Olaparib, commercially emerged from RU865.

(xxvii) Natco had sought to rely on the Form 27s filed by Kudos, for the genus patent IN218 and the species patent IN720. The filing of Form 27 did not amount to any kind of admission that Olaparib was specifically disclosed in both the patents. One product can conceivably be covered by several patents and several patents could cover a single commercial product. This position stands statutorily recognized by Sections 3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141 of the Patents Act.  The amended form 27 requires all patentees to file a single Form 27 for multiple patents, provided all patents are related or worked through one product.  As such, the fact that one Form 27 had been filed both for species patent IN720 and genus patent IN218 did not constitute any admission that both disclosed Olaparib. They were merely related patents, as genie and species patents respectively. 

(xxviii) Similarly, the Patent Term Extension (PTE) application filed by Kudos in respect of Australian Patent AU 2001295789 (AU789)  which corresponded to the Indian genus Patent IN218  was completely irrelevant and did not constitute any admission that Olaparib was disclosed in the genus patent.  The Patents Act in Australia provides PTEs to account for delay which could occur when obtaining regulatory approvals for pharmaceuticals.  Reliance has been placed, in this context, on Sections 70 to 79A of the Australian Patents Act 1990. The above legal position stands exposited by this Court in paras 67, 67.1 and 67.2 of its judgment in  Novartis-I. 

(xxix) In PCT application WO 2021/224381 of Kudos, there was an inadvertent statement that Olaparib was disclosed in WO976, which corresponded to the genus patent IN218.  Immediate corrective steps had been taken by Kudos to rectify this error and it now stands clarified that Olaparib was described in WO976, which corresponds to IN720, the species patent. That this was an error is also manifested from the fact that Kudos applied for several other patents related to Olaparib, referring to WO976 as the patent which described Olaparib.  Specific instances in this regard have been provided. 

(xxx) The challenge to the validity of the suit patent IN720 on the ground that it suffered from insufficiency of disclosure under Section 64(1)(h) was not one which could be examined by the court at an interlocutory stage. It was a question of fact, not a question of law, and would have to be decided only once evidence was led and Kudos was granted an opportunity to cross examine its witnesses.  Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on the judgment of this Court in Communication Components Antenna Inc v. Mobi Antenna Technologies (Shenzen) Co. Ltd.26 and on Terrell on the Law of Patents.

(xxxi) Natcos reliance on Section 8(2) to the Patents Act, vis-à-vis the omission on Kudos part to reveal details of the Patent Applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), corresponding to the suit patent IN720 during the time of prosecution of the application resulting in its grant, before the Indian Patent office, was also unsustainable.  Reliance has been placed, in this context, on a letter written to Kudos by its Agent on 14 December 2007, informing Kudos of the Section 8 objection raised by the IPO and requesting Kudos to supply the search and examination report for corresponding patent applications filed in the US and Europe.  Such an inadvertent, unintentional error would not amount to violation of Section 8(2) so as to disentitle the patentee to interlocutory relief. Reliance has been placed, in this context, on paras 27 and 28 of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Sukesh Bahl v. K. Philips Electronics27 and paras 123 to 125 of F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd28.  In any case the Kudos stood to gain nothing by suppressing the patent applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), as both applications had been granted.  

(xxxii) Natcos contention that the suit patent IN720 suffered from lack of inventive step, as it had not demonstrated any technical advance of Olaparib over prior art, was contrary to the very words of Section 2(1) (ja) of the Patents Act, which defined inventive step as meaning a feature of an invention that involves technical advance compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.  As such, technical advance over prior art is not a mandatory pre-requisite for an inventive step to be found to be involved in a patent claim.  Economic significance of the product related to the claim would also suffice to make out an inventive step.  Olaparib definitely possesses economic significance over prior art. It is sold over 90 countries, used for the treatment of multiple tumour types, and is a certified blockbuster drug, with sales revenues of over USD 2.3 billion in 2021.   In 2016, the US FDA had granted breakthrough therapy status to Olaparib for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.   The very definition of a therapy as breakthrough indicated that it possessed substantial improvement over existing therapy.  Mr. Anand places reliance on literature explaining the concept of a breakthrough therapy.  

(xxxiii) It is only if the suit patent were to lack in inventive steps, as envisaged by Section 2(1) (ja), that it could be said to be vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.  Inasmuch as Olaparib could not be said to lack in inventive step over prior art, the suit patent was not vulnerable to invalidity for want of obviousness. 

(xxxiv) In order to be valid, a claim for patenting an invention was not required to demonstrate superiority of the invention over prior art. All that was required to be shown was that the invention satisfies the test of novelty, non-obviousness and utility. 

(xxxv) In view of the fact that the genus patent IN218 did not contain the teaching to lead a person skilled in the art to synthesize Olaparib, as the compound claimed in Claim I of the species patent in IN720, from the Markush formula claimed in Claim I of the genus patent, and it was possible to synthesize Olaparib from the Markush claim in the genus patent only by cherry-picking the substituents from the several suggested substitutions in Claim I, and substituting them on the Markush radicals by employing hindsight reconstruction, it was clear that the Olaparib could not be said to be disclosed, much less claimed, in Claim I of the genus patent IN218.

For all these reasons, among others, Mr. Anand submits that, as the fact of infringement is indisputable, and as Natco has not succeeded in setting up a credible challenge to the suit patent, indicating that it is vulnerable to invalidity, Kudos is entitled to an interlocutory injunction as sought. 

18. Inasmuch as the defendant has, undisputedly, manufactured and sold generic Olaparib during the life of the suit patent, the fact of infringement of the suit patent by the defendant, as understood stricto sensu, cannot be disputed either.  Mr. Sai Deepak, however, invokes Section 107, read with clauses (a), (d), (e), (f), (j), (k) and (m) of Section 64(1) of the Patents Act to defend the charge of infringement, and the reliefs sought by Kudos on that basis.  He also submits that, for defending an allegation of infringement, and successfully opposing a prayer for interlocutory injunction, a defendant is only required to put forward a credible challenge, demonstrating the suit patent to be vulnerable to invalidity on one or the other grounds envisaged by Section 64(1).  His submissions, according to him, meet that standard.

19. To save time and space, I propose to decide this application by dealing, seriatim, with the various points of defence raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-vis the submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand in that regard.  In doing so, aspects which involve detailed examination of facts and which, therefore, would merit an exhaustive analysis after both sides are given an opportunity to lead evidence, are not being addressed, adhering to the discipline of Astrazeneca-I and Pernod Ricard.  I shall, however, note the said issues towards the conclusion of this order.

The consideration of credible challenge

20. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that the defendant is only required to raise a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent in order to succeed in its defence against infringement.

21. There is no dispute about this legal position.

22. However, it is necessary to understand what credible challenge means. In this context, this court has held, in para 19 of FMC-II, paras 178 and 231 to 233 of Novartis I and para 129 of Novartis II thus:

FMC-II
19. 	Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity of the plaintiff's patent need not be such as to demonstrate, conclusively, the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant is able to make out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to revocation under the Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however, to be demonstrated by way of a credible challenge. The onus would be on the defendant, therefore, to establish the credibility of the challenge raised by it. The challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful, or moonshine. It must not strain the sinews of acceptability. There can, however, needless to say, be no fixed standard on the basis of which the credibility of the challenge can be assessed. It would be for the Court, in each case, therefore, to ascertain, for itself, whether the challenge raised by the defendant, to the validity of the suit patent, is, or is not, credible.

Novartis I

 178. 	 The challenge in this regard must be credible. Credibility indicates that, on the face of the challenge, it must merit favourable consideration. A credible challenge occupies a higher pedestal than a challenge, which is merely worthy of consideration.

xxxxx
231. 	Before closing the discussion, I wish to enter a final observation. There appears, prima facie, to me, to be a fundamental misconception relating the concepts of a credible challenge and of vulnerability. The submissions advanced by the defendant seem to have been predicated on the premise that the slightest shadow of doubt, which could be cast on the suit patent, was sufficient to constitute a credible challenge, exposing its vulnerability to revocation. This proposition, according to me, is completely misconceived. Para 28 of the report in Bishwanath Prasad Radheyshyamrecognises the fact that, prior to grant of a patent, especially for a pharmaceutical product, a thorough study is normally undertaken by the Patent Office, regarding the validity of the patent as sought. When an infringer seeks to defend infringement on the ground that the patent that he infringes is invalid, the onus, to prove such invalidity heavily lies on him. This standard has to be met, when applying the principle of credibility. Repeated attempts were made to convince me that any and every ground that the defendant sought to raise, and for which a cast iron response from the plaintiff was not immediately forthcoming, was sufficient to establish vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation. Revocation is a drastic act, and a patent, once granted, cannot be treated as easily vulnerable to revocation. Even if, prima facie, a ground for revocation is made out, as is noted in Merck v. Glenmark, revocation is not automatic, but remains a matter of discretion, for the patent authority. The grant of such discretion is itself a pointer to the legislative intent that, before revoking a patent, the authority is required to satisfy itself, that, all considerations having been mould in mind, revocation is absolutely necessary. Vulnerability to revocation has also to be judged on the same standard. It is only when, judged on that standard, a credible challenge to the validity of the patent as vulnerable to revocation is made out, that an infringer can escape the consequences of infringement. The standard is, therefore, high, rather than low.

232. 	This would especially be so in a situation, as in the present case, the infringer never choose to challenge the suit patent either at pre-grant or at post-grant stage, by filing oppositions. The defendants have not, therefore, cleared the way, before exploiting the suit patent. Mr. Sai Deepak sought to contend that, by deferring the release of their Eltrombopag Olamine, till the expiry of the term of IN 176, the defendants had sufficiently cleared the way. Mr. Hemant Singh has disputed this contention, and I confess that I agree with him. IN 161 was granted as far back as on 27th March, 2009. It has remained in force for 12 years. The defendants have neither chosen to launch any pre-grant or post-grant, opposition to IN 161. Nor have they filed any proceedings before the patent office or the IPAB, to cancel or suspend the registration granted to IN 161. Rather, even while IN 161 continues to remain valid, the defendants have, without blinking an eyelid, sought to exploit the subject matter of the said patent, i.e. EO. That they have done so with the full awareness that EO is specifically claimed in IN 161, is not disputed. Clearly, therefore, the defendants have, by their attitude, as well as by failing to clear the way before exploiting the suit patent, IN 161, exposed themselves to an interlocutory injunction.

233. 	It is only when they have been caught in the act, as it were, that the infringer defendants, unable to dispute the charge of infringement on facts, seek to question the validity of the suit patent. While Section 64, undoubtedly, allow them to do so, the challenge has to be credible, not incredible. The defendants, in the present case, neither launched any pre-grant nor any post-grant, opposition to IN 161. They have not initiated any proceeding before IPAB or any other authority, for revocation, cancellation or removal of the suit patent from the register of patents. In such circumstances, the holder of the suit patent would ordinarily be entitled to an injunction against continued infringement. Absent any prima facie case of vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation on the ground of invalidity, therefore, injunction cannot be refused, once infringement is established.

Novartis II

 129. 	In fact, Natco has, in its submissions, completely glossed over the most important query which it would have to answer, in order to set up even a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent, vis-à-vis a Markush prior art. The suit patent could be said to be vulnerable to invalidity, vis-à-vis known Markush prior art, only if it is established, cumulatively, that

(i) 	from the known prior art, it is possible to arrive at the suit patent, by effecting suggested substitutions in the Markush formula claimed in the prior art, from the substitutions suggested therein, and

(ii) the Markush prior art contains the requisite teaching, as would suggest the substitutions which are to be so made in order to arrive at the suit patent.


23. Thus, the onus to establish that the challenge raised by it is credible, is on the respondent. A credible challenge, as Mr. Pravin Anand has correctly submitted, is a challenge which is not incredible, fanciful, or moonshine, and must prima facie be acceptable. On its face, the challenge must merit favorable consideration. It is not enough for the defendant to raise a challenge which is worthy of consideration. The challenge must be more than that; it must partake of the character of prima facie acceptability. credibility, even by itself, connotes a fairly high standard. In examining whether the challenge raised is credible, a relevant consideration is the fact that the Patent Office has, after a thorough study, found the patent to be valid and capable of being granted. In Merck, the Division Bench of this Court held that, even if a ground for revocation of a granted patent was made out, revocation was not an inevitable sequitur, but that the patent authority retained discretion in that regard.  The same standard has to be adopted while examining vulnerability to revocation. The standard of credibility is, therefore, a high standard, not a low standard, as is commonly understood.

II.	The decision in Astrazeneca-I

24. Mr. Sai Deepak laid great stress on the decision in Astrazeneca-I.  According to him, the view taken by this Bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II can no longer be followed after the decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I.  As against this, Mr. Pravin Anand points out that, when the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II was cited before the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, the Division Bench did not overrule the decision, but only distinguished it on the ground that, in FMC-II, only the specie patent was asserted by the plaintiff whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, both genus and specie patent were asserted.  

25. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that the observation that, in FMC-II, the specie patent alone was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, both genus and specie patent were asserted, was merely a closing observation of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, and to accord that closing observation pre-eminence over all other findings of the Division Bench would be a lopsided approach.  He submits that the closing observation regarding the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II does not dilute the rigour of the rest of the judgment in Astrazeneca-I, or take away its precedential value.  The findings in the decision, he submit, apply on all fours to the facts at hand, and are directly contrary to the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II.  All those findings cannot, he submit, be overlooked merely because of the closing observation differentiating the decision in FMC-II from the facts which were before the Division Bench.

Effect of reference, in Astrazeneca-I, to the decision in FMC-II

26. In so submitting, Mr. Sai Deepak overlooks the fact that, had the Division Bench felt that the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II was wrong, the easiest thing would have to be to overrule it.  Indeed, that would be the only natural course of action which the Division Bench would ordinarily have followed.  The Division Bench did not, however, do so, and it would, therefore, be overreaching the decision of the Division Bench if one were to read Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II.  It appears, prima facie, incongruous if an interpreter of a judgment were, in the process of interpreting, to rewrite the judgment as doing what the author of the judgment could have done, but did not choose to do.   

27. The Division Bench, therefore, consciously refrained from overruling the view of this Bench in FMC-II.  The words used by the Division Bench are of stellar significance.  The Division Bench observes:
51. 	The counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, on 12th July, 2021 mentioned the matter, to draw attention to judgment dated 7th July, 2021 in applications for interim relief in CS(COMM) No. 69/2021 and CS(COMM) No. 661/2019 titled FMC Corporation v. Best Crop Science LLP. In taking the view aforesaid, we have considered the said judgment also, in which infringement of one patent only was claimed.
(Emphasis supplied)

28.  Nothing, in my considered opinion, could be plainer.  The Division Bench was specifically shown the decision of this Bench in FMC-II.  The Division Bench noted that, in arriving at its view, it had also considered the decision of this Bench in FMC-II.  After considering the decision of this Bench in FMC-II, the Division Bench propounded the view that it did, and the identifying and distinguishing feature of the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II is, clearly, from the italicised words in para 52 of the report in Astrazeneca-I, the fact that, in FMC-II, only the specie patent was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, Astrazeneca asserted both the genie and specie patent, contending that the impugned invention of Intas infringed both patents.  It is because of this distinguishing feature that the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, without disturbing the decision of this Bench in FMC, held as it did.  That much, according to me, is clear from para 52 of Astrazeneca-I.

29. It would, therefore, be folly, according to me, for any hierarchically subordinate Court, or Bench, to interpret the decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II, or even as disapproving the view expressed therein.

Assuming Mr Sai Deepaks contention to be correct  Discussion in main body of the decision in Astrazeneca-I


30. Even if one were to go along with Mr. Sai Deepaks submission, and advert to the body of the Astrazeneca-I decision, one finds that the Division Bench has proceeded almost entirely on the consideration that Astrazeneca had, in its suit, asserted both the genus and the specie patents.  It is helpful, in this context, to vivisect the Astrazeneca-I decision into its individual components, as that would help a great deal in understanding what the Division Bench went on to hold.  For this purpose, the para numbers to which I allude are the para numbers of the report in the SCC OnLine journal.

31. Astrazeneca, in its suit, asserted two patents; IN 205147 (IN 147) and IN 235625 (IN625).  On the basis thereof, Astrazeneca sought an injunction against Intas manufacturing or otherwise dealing in Dapagliflozin (DAPA).  The facts of the case are not of much significance, and are contained in paras 1 to 14 of the report.  

32. The Division Bench proceeds, in para 16 of the report, to enumerate the contentions of learned Counsel for Astrazeneca.  Thereafter, paras 17 to 21, the Division Bench observes thus:
17. 	Though ordinarily we would have recorded the arguments of the counsels for the respondent(s)/defendant(s) also but need therefor is not felt in the facts of the present case since during the hearing itself, we entertained doubts/reservations as spelled out herein below, and which doubts inter alia also form the defence of the respondent(s)/defendant(s).

18. 	Our doubts stemmed from, the appellants/plaintiffs averring and pleading manufacture and sale by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA to be in infringement of two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. It was felt, that if DAPA was not disclosed and/or known at the time of seeking patent IN 147 or US equivalent thereof and was invented only subsequently and patent thereof obtained in IN 625 or US equivalent thereof, there could be no infringement by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 by manufacturing and/or selling DAPA. Conversely, once the appellants/plaintiffs claimed infringement of IN 147 also, it necessarily followed that DAPA was subject matter thereof and once it was the subject matter thereof, how it could be the subject matter of subsequent patent IN 625.

19. 	It was thus enquired from the counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, that if the patent IN 147 was/is not of DAPA, how could the appellants/plaintiffs in the suits from which these appeals arise, claim infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 also, by manufacturing DAPA. It was further enquired, whether not from the factum of the appellants/plaintiffs, in the suits from which these appeals arise, having claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 as well as IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are deemed to have admitted DAPA as the subject matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625.

20. 	We, at this stage, spell out the thought process behind the aforesaid query.

21. 	In our opinion, with respect to one invention, there can be only one patent. The appellants/plaintiffs herein however, while claiming one invention only i.e. DAPA, are claiming two patents with respect thereto, with infringement of both, by the respondent(s)/defendant(s). The same alone, in our view, strikes at the very root of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs and disentitles the appellants/plaintiffs from any interim relief.
(Emphasis supplied)


33. Paras 25 to 28, 31, 32, 36, 43 and 45 of the report proceed to observe thus:
25. 	With invention, as defined in the statute, forming the core of a patent and the appellants/plaintiffs in their suits having claimed only one invention i.e. DAPA, as subject matter of both the patents, we wondered whether there could be two patents with respect to the same invention and proceeded to examine the two patents, to decipher the invention claimed in each.

26. 	IN 147 sets out the field of invention as under:
      The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases, employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents.
27. 	IN 625 sets out the field of invention as under:
      The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases, employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents.
28. 	As would immediately be obvious from above, there is complete identity, without any difference whatsoever, between the field of invention as set out in the two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. For IN 625 to be with respect to a new product involving an inventive step i.e. a feature involving a technical advance as compared to existing knowledge including of IN 147 or having economic significance and which was not anticipated by earlier publication or use including of IN 147, to say the least, we expected the description of the field of invention in IN 625 to describe the technical advancement and/or the difference in efficacy, from that in IN 147.

*****

31. 	The Patents Act, though protects the rights and interests of inventors, but for a limited period, whereafter the monopoly of the patentee ceases and comes to an end and the invention with respect to which patent was granted, falls in public domain i.e. open for all to practice and reap benefit of. A patent, vide Section 48 of the Act, confers a right on the patentee of a product patent, as DAPA is, to, during the life of the patent, prevent others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing, the new product with respect whereto patent is granted. The life of a patent is limited, whereafter, notwithstanding the new product having been invented by the patentee, patentee no longer has exclusive right to make, use or offer for sale the same and anyone else interested can also make, use or offer for sale the said new product invented by the patentee, without any interference from the patentee. If patents with respect to the same invention can be granted more than once, successively in time, the same will negate the legislative intent of limiting the life of the patent and enable the patentee to prevent others from making, using or offering for sale, the new product invented by the patentee, till the time patentee successively keeps on obtaining patent therefor.

32. 	As far as the arguments of the counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, of DAPA being only covered and not disclosed in IN 147 and being disclosed for the first time in IN 625, and of DAPA being not obvious from and capable of being anticipated from IN 147 are concerned, we are also of the opinion that once the appellants/plaintiffs, in the plaints in their suits claimed the action of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of manufacturing medicines having DAPA as their ingredient to be an infringement of both IN 147 and IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are deemed to have admitted DAPA to be the invention subject matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Without DAPA being disclosed in IN 147, there could be no patent with respect to DAPA in IN 147 and which was being infringed by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) by manufacturing drugs/medicines with DAPA as ingredient.
*****

36. 	From the aforesaid provisions it follows, that from IN 147 and/or US equivalent thereof, the invention as described therein could be worked by anyone, save for the exclusivity for the term thereof in favour of the appellants/plaintiffs. However the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs is, that DAPA was not disclosed in the specifications of IN 147 but 80 other compounds were disclosed. However if that were to be the case, it being not the case of the appellants/plaintiffs that the respondent(s)/defendant(s) were manufacturing any of the said 80 compounds, the appellants/plaintiffs, for manufacture by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA, cannot claim infringement of IN 147 and could have claimed infringement only of IN 625 in which DAPA was disclosed.

*****

43. 	However, under the Indian regime, patent is to be sought and granted with respect to a new product or process. Product is not defined in the Act. The said word is thus deemed to have been used in the Act, as commonly understood. Product is understood as something that is made to be sold, usually something that is produced by an industrial process or, less commonly, something that is grown or obtained through farming. However, the arguments of the appellants/plaintiffs before us make out IN 147 to be a discovery/invention of a group of formulations, which was capable, with further research, of acting as a drug/medicine for inhibiting re-absorption of sugar in kidneys. The appellants/plaintiffs, on the basis thereof could not have manufactured any drug/medicine and have not pleaded any drug/medicine manufactured post IN 147 and thus it prima facie appears, could not have restrained any other person who discovered DAPA, even if from IN 147. In fact we wondered, why the appellants/plaintiffs have pleaded and claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Though in response to our query aforesaid, we expected the appellants/plaintiffs to confine their claim for infringement to IN 625 only but the appellants/plaintiffs stuck to their stand of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) being also in infringement of IN 147. It is obvious therefrom that the appellants/plaintiffs have no legs to stand on, by claiming infringement of IN 625 only, without also claiming infringement of IN 147. However, as held in the impugned judgment/order dated 2nd November, 2020, the question of the respondent(s)/defendant(s), by working DAPA, infringing IN 147 could arise only if DAPA was disclosed in IN 147. If DAPA was disclosed in IN 147, even if better disclosed in IN 625, cannot enjoy two rounds of 20 years of protection, when the legislative policy is to grant protection for a period of one term of 20 years only.

*****
45. 	We, at least at this stage are unable to, in the face of the aforesaid pleadings of the appellants/plaintiffs themselves, find any difference between IN 147 and IN 625. The appellants/plaintiffs themselves are found to be pleading DAPA to have been disclosed generally in IN 147 and specifically in IN 625. In the face of the said pleading, no case for injuncting the respondent(s)/defendant(s) during the pendency of the suits is made out. As aforesaid, we entertain doubt as to the very basis of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs, as noted in the judgment/order dated 2nd November, 2020 identifying the key question in the dispute to be whether the compound-in-issue i.e. Dapagliflozin [in short DAPA] which, according to the plaintiffs, is covered in IN 147 stands disclosed both, in law as well as on facts.


34. In the face of the afore-extracted passages, it would be facile to even suggest that the simultaneous assertion, by Astrazeneca, of the genus patent IN147 and the species patent IN625, resulting in the allegation that the manufacture and sale, by Intas, of dapagliflozin infringed both the genus and the species patents, did not play a predominant role in the Division Bench holding as it did. In para 18, the Division Bench holds that, by simultaneously claiming infringement of the genus and the species patent, Astrazeneca had admitted that DAPA was the subject matter of both patents. In para 21, it is observed, even more significantly, that Astrazeneca was claiming two patents...with infringement of both. This act of Astrazeneca in claiming both the genus and the species patent through DAPA, and alleging infringement of both patents by Intas, was found by the Division Bench to strike at the very root of the claim of Astrazeneca, disentitling it to any interim relief. The simultaneous assertion by Astrazeneca of the genus and the species patent, and the consequent allegation that the manufacturer of DAPA by Intas had infringed both patents, was found by the Division Bench, in para 32 of the report, to amount to a deemed admission, by Astrazeneca, that DAPA was the invention subject matter of both the genus and the species patents. By thus claiming the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas as infringing the genus and the species patents, the Division Bench observed that Astrazeneca had impliedly acknowledged the disclosure of DAPA in the complete specifications both of the genus and the species patent. Thus, the act of Astrazeneca, in alleging the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing the genus as well as the species patent, was found to foreclose Astrazeneca from maintaining any stand that the genus patent did not disclose DAPA. 

35. This position is even more prominently underscored in para 36 of the report, in which the Division Bench holds that if the case of Astrazeneca were that DAPA was not disclosed in the genus patent, though 80 other compounds were disclosed, DAPA could not have blamed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas, to be infringing the genus patent IN147.  Para 39 of the report again emphasizes the view of the Division Bench, that, if the genus patent IN147 did not disclose DAPA, AstraZeneca could not have claimed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing IN147. The concluding observation in para 39 specifically holds that the act of Astrazeneca in pleading infringement of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625 had, at least at the interlocutory stage, to be treated as an admission, by Astrazeneca, of DAPA being a known substance, while obtaining the genus patent.

36. Para 43 of the report gives voice to the concern, of the Division Bench, as to why Astrazeneca had pleaded and claimed infringement, by Intas, of both the genus and the species patents. Significantly, the paragraph goes on to observe that, when the Division Bench had queried Astrazeneca in that regard, it was expected that Astrazeneca would confine their claim of infringement only to the species patent  which is what Kudos has done in the present case.  The obvious sequitur is that, had Astrazeneca restricted its claim of infringement to the species patent, instead of alleging infringement of the genus and species patent both, the outcome of the judgment would have been different.  The submission of Mr. Sai Deepak that the ultimate decision in Astrazeneca-I would not be different even if Astrazeneca had asserted only the species patent, instead of asserting genus and species patents both, is, therefore, clearly unsustainable, in the light of the observations in para 43 of Astrazeneca-I.

37. The insistence, by Astrazeneca, to continue to plead infringement by Intas, of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625 was found to be defeating the case that Astrazeneca was seeking to set up. 

38. Practically, the entire reasoning of the Division Bench of this Court in Astrazeneca-I, therefore, revolves around the fact that Astrazeneca was pleading infringement, by DAPA, of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625. This assertion of simultaneous infringement of both the genus and the species patents was found to completely defeat the case of Astrazeneca.  Perhaps, most significantly, in para 43, the Division Bench observed that Astrazeneca might have had a case, had it restricted its claim of infringement to the species patent, rather than claiming infringement of both the genus and the species patents.  

39. In the present case, there is no dispute that Kudos has claimed infringement only of the species patent IN720 and has claimed no infringement of the genus patent IN218. The above observations of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, particularly in conjunction with the manner in which the Division Bench sought to distinguish the judgment of this court in FMC-II, clearly indicates that, in a case where the species patent alone is asserted, and no infringement of the genus patent is pleaded, the decision in FMC-II would continue to hold the field. 

40. In fact, far from Astrazeneca-I overruling FMC-II, or FMC-II being no longer good law after the decision in Astrazeneca-I, my understanding is that, in a case where a species patent alone is asserted, Astrazeneca-I upholds the decision in FMC-II as representing the correct legal position. The decision in Astrazeneca-I having been upheld by the Supreme Court by dismissal of the SLP, in a case where the species patent alone is asserted, the correct legal position would be the position taken by this Court in FMC-II. 

III.	Individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak

41. The individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak in the present case are all covered by the earlier decisions of this bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II.  Though appeals may have been preferred against these decisions, I have not been informed of any interlocutory order having been passed, staying their operation.

42. I deem it necessary, therefore, only to allude to the relevant passages from the decisions of this bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II, which address the issues raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-vis the facts which arise in the present case, rather than re-analyze the legal position ab initio.

IV.	The coverage v. disclosure conundrum and the challenge on the ground of obviousness and lack of inventive step  Section 64(1)(f)

43. The aspect of whether coverage and disclosure are the same, or whether coverage implies disclosure, has to be decided on the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Novartis AG, as the Supreme Court has specifically alluded to the point.  Howsoever one may interpret or understand Novartis AG, it is not permissible for any court, lower in the judicial hierarchy to the Supreme Court, to allow its judicial peregrinations to take it outside Novartis AG of that decision, when dealing with the aspect of coverage vis-à-vis disclosure.

44. In FMC-II, this Court has analyzed the decision in Novartis AG threadbare, para by para.  The conclusion that this Court has arrived is contained in paras 81 to 84 of the decision, which may be reproduced thus:
81. 	Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis  have, in my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, which set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, by learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina. Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual controversy before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced were general in nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as contained in paras 118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally omnibus. What was contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as recorded in paras 114 and 116 of the report, was that the scope of coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a patent. This argument stands reiterated, in the same para (para 116) - that coverage that is granted in respect of a patent is not always co-extensive with what is disclosed in the patent. In the light of the Zimmerman invention, learned Senior Counsel contended that the patent may be entitled to larger coverage than what is specifically disclosed in it. The teaching in the patent, it was contended, lay in the disclosure/specification that supports the claim, which describes the invention. Dealing with these submissions, the Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that the dichotomy sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on the one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of patent. The words in a patent, as used by the Supreme Court, indicated of the intent of the Supreme Court to be expounding the law in general terms, and not limited to the Zimmerman patent, or the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare reading of para 118 of the report in Novartis AG makes it clear that the Supreme Court has expressed its view with respect to patents in general. The opening sentence of para 119 of the report is a proposition couched in absolute terms and, in my respectful opinion, it would be folly, on the part of this Court, to restrict those observations to the facts of Novartis AG.

82. 	According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of repetition), any dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage or claim, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent, struck at the very root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the Supreme Court has disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any dichotomy being sought to be drawn between coverage and disclosure.

83. 	Having said that, etymologically, dichotomy is not the same as distinction. The Supreme Court has not held that coverage and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is no distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its words with precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no dichotomy between coverage and disclosure. Dichotomy is defined, in the Oxford Dictionary, as a division or contrast between two things that are or are being represented as being opposed or entirely different. In holding that there can be no dichotomy between coverage or claim, on the one hand, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the other, the Supreme Court has not, therefore, held that they are identical. Accepting the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require this Court to place, in the first sentence in para 119 of the report in Novartis AG , the word dichotomy with distinction or difference. That, I am afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court has, in disapproving the existence of any wide gap between coverage and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold that the concepts were identical.

84. 	Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus, would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act, which make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to disclosure. Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not envisage the claim or coverage of the claim, to be identical to disclosure. Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held. What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court, by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in the Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore, covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not disclosed by it. Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to holding that there was complete dichotomy between coverage and disclosure, with no connection between the two. It would amount to holding that, while examining what was disclosed in a patent, the authority, or the Court concerned, was to remain oblivious to the coverage of the patent. Such a dichotomy, which would result in a wide gap between coverage and disclosure was, in terms, disapproved by the Supreme Court. If, however, there was clear coverage of a product in the claim (as was found to exist in the Zimmerman Patent, qua Imatinib Mesylate), it would be difficult for the patent holder to assert, before the Court, that, despite such coverage, the claim did not disclose the product. That, in my view, is what Novartis AG holds. It does not pronounce that coverage and disclosure are identical or synonymous terms, in patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai Deepak, to that effect cannot, therefore, be accepted.

45. It cannot, therefore, be said that coverage is the same as disclosure or that, by accepting coverage of the impugned product by the genus patent, the plaintiff also admits disclosure.  

46. A bare glance at the Markush structure claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN218, vis-à-vis the chemical structure of Olaparib as claimed in Claim I of the species patent IN720, makes it apparent that Olaparib cannot be said to have been disclosed in the genus patent.
 
47. Natcos pleadings in this regard are admittedly to be found in paras 89 to 106 of the written statement filed by way of response to the present plaint, which read thus:
89. 	The following submissions are made without prejudice to the foregoing averments as well as subsequently following submissions under other grounds of revocation. 

90. 	It is submitted that the claims of IN720 lack inventive step and/or are obvious in view of the following prior art, when taken independently or in any combination: 

Teachings of WO576

91. 	WO576 discloses the preparation of specific product claimed in IN720. The specific portions of the complete specification of WO576 specifically teaches and also categorically suggests the the specific substitutions in the Markush structure of WO576 which result in Olaparib claimed in IN720. For the purpose of convenience, the specific portions of the complete specification of WO576 are reproduced below: 

WO576 discloses the following compound

wherein

A-B, RN and RC can be optionally substituted.

Substitution of A-B

Page 5 of the complete specification states the second aspect of the present invention wherein

A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused aromatic ring

At Page 7 of the complete specification describes aromatic ring as follows:

The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure having delocalised n-electron orbitals.

Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:

In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group comprises a single aromatic ring, which has five or six ring atoms,
which ring atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulphur, and which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of these groups include benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole, thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole.

Substitution of RC

RC is -CH2-RL;

Substitution of RL

RL is optionally substituted phenyl

At Page 19 of the description:

RL is preferably a benzene ring, naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3- benzodioxole, and more preferably a benzene ring

When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The one or
more substituents may be selected from: C1-7 alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20 aryl; C3-20 heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy ester and amido; amino (including sulfonamide), more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino; acylamido including ureido groups, where the acyl or amino substituent is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.

On page 15 of the complete specification preferred substituents of the benzene ring when RL is phenyl is given and includes:

Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C
(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -C(=0)N(CH3)2, - C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and -C(=0)N(CH2CH3)2, as well as amido groups in which R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl.

Substitution of RN

92. 	The specific disclosures in WO576 regarding these particular substitutions provides the teaching, suggestion and motivation and also makes it obvious for a person skilled in the art to reach to the desired product i.e., Olaparib claimed in IN720.

93. 	It is pertinent that there is nothing in IN720 which would show any technical advancement or economic significance over the disclosure of WO576  given the substantial identity of the respective disclosures (as outlined above under prior publication and relied on for purposes of brevity as if reproduced herein).

94. 	Given that the dosages, the modes of formulation and even
the concentration of active in formulation are identical, IN720 is woefully lacking in any material which would show the purported inventive step of the claims that were granted. It is in fact equally pertinent that Olaparib, i.e.,Compound 168 of IN720 actually lacks supporting disclosure to show that it has the same benefits of IC50 values or potentiating growth factor values as the remaining
compounds of that document, let alone better values than the compounds disclosed in WO576. Simply put, IN720 lacks any seed material to support the claim of inventive step over WO576.

95.	 It is therefore submitted that IN720 must be rejected alone on the ground of lack of inventive step and/or obviousness based on WO576 alone.

Teachings of WO 2002/014090

96. 	Yet another prior art on the basis of which IN720 lacks inventive step is WO090. The details of WO090 are as follows:

98. 	The cited prior art relates to the amino phthalazinone derivatives active as Kinase inhibitors. Page 4 Placitum 16 of WO090 states:

The present invention provides a method for treating diseases caused by and/or associated with an altered protein kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of an amino-phthalazinone derivative represented by formula (I): 

wherein the relevant teaching is as follows:

Ra and Rb are, each independently, a hydrogen atom or a group,
R2 is a hydrogen atom or it is a group, optionally further substituted m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3;

R1 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted group selected from
alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclyl or
heterocyclylalkyl

Page 31 placitum 35 defines arylalkyl group as:

arylalkyl group such as, for instance, the benzyl group, by working
according to conventional methods.	

Page 10 placitum 4 further describes the substitution of benzyl group as:
optionally substituted in any of the free positions by one or more groups, for instance 1 to 6 groups, selected from: halogen, nitro, oxo groups (=0) , carboxy, cyano, alkyl, perfluorinated alkyl, alkenyl alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, a ino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino.

99. The above disclosure of WO090 not only teaches but also suggests the specific substitutions described above. For a person of skill in the art, this also provides the motivation to try and practice the substitutions taught and suggested in  WO090 since the cited document also relates to providing anti-tumour compounds. The difference if any resides in that WO090 suggests and additional substitution of an amino on the benzene ring. There is however, nothing to suggest that the unsubstituted phthalazinone would be ineffective or is not preferred. In any event, even this differential is overcome when WO090 and WO576 are read together  which would provide a phthalazinone derivative without the additional amino substitution on the benzene ring. There is sufficient motivation to read the two documents together since both in essence relate to phthalazinone derivatives and both purportedly provide compounds with anti-tumoral activity. When the teaching of WO090 is read together with the teachings of WO576, there is sufficient, teaching, suggestion and motivation which renders the claims of IN720 and in particular Olaparib obvious for a person of skill in the art. On the above-mentioned ground, IN720 lacks inventive step and is obvious to a person of skill in the art.

Teachings of EP 0289881

100. EP881 relates to 2-aminoalkyl-4-benzyl-1-(2H)- phthalazinone derivatives and was published on 09.11.1988. It is therefore prior art for IN720. EP881 describes compounds which are useful as antiasthmatic, antiallergic, Paf-antagonistic (Paf = platelet activating factor, mediator, which triggers asthma inter alia) and leukotriene-inhibition. The EPO machine-translated copy of EP881 is filed in the proceedings.
Page 1 of EP881 states:
"".a process for preparing basic substituted phthalazinone of the general formula

	

in which R1 represents an aryl or aralkyl radical optionally
substituted in the nucleus, R2 represents a divalent straight or branched aliphatic chain having at least 2 and at most 5 carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 denote low molecular weight alkyl groups which, together with the nitrogen, may be members of a heterocyclic ring, or their salts or quaternary ammonium compounds. For these compounds, a histaminolytic (antihistamine) effect, spasmolytic and local anaesthetic effect is specified.

The radical R1 is preferably in the 4-position of the phenyl ring; occurring C1-C6-alkyl groups, C1-C6-alkoxy groups, alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups can be straight or branched, in particular these radicals consist of 1-4 or, if they are unsaturated, of 3-4 C atoms.

If R3 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group, there is at least one saturated C atom between the unsaturated bond and the nitrogen. The unsaturated bond is preferably in the 2,3-position or 3,4-position. 

The C3-C8-cycloalkyl radical is in particular the cyclopentyl radical or cyclohexyl radical.

If R3 represents a phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical, this may be mono -,di-or trisubstituted by the stated radicals. The alkyl part of this phenylalkyl radical preferably consists of one, two or three C atoms and may optionally also be branched.

The alkylene bridge Alk can be straight or branched and preferably consists of two, three or four C atoms. If this alkylene bridge contains Alk a double bond, it is isolated from the group NR2 R3 if R2 is hydrogen (ie, not conjugated to this group). Preferably, at least one saturated carbon atom is located between such a double bond and the
two nitrogen bonds.

Particularly favourable effects have, for example, those compounds where the radicals R1 to R3, Alk have the following meanings: R1 = fluorine, chlorine or bromine, in particular in the 4-position, preferably fluorine in the 4-position; R2 = C1-C6-alkyl, preferably methyl; R3 = phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl, optionally substituted as indicated. 

The substituents of the phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical are preferably C1-C4-alkyl groups (in particular methyl) or a halogen (for example Cl, F) or C1-C4-alkoxy groups (in particular methoxy groups). The substituents in the phenyl part of this phenylalkyl radical are preferably in the 2-position, 3-position, 4-position or 2,4-position. Occurring alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkanoylamino or alkoxy alkyl groups may be straight or branched.Alkyl or alkoxy radicals preferably consist of 1 to 4 C atoms, the alkanoyl radicals preferably consist of 2 to 4 C atoms.

101. The teachings of EP881 suggest similar structure of phthalazinone derivatives and also suggests towards the substitution of phenyl at R1 which is further substituted with a halo group (one of which is F) as preferred. Hence, if such teachings of EP881 are read with the teachings of WO576 and/or WO090, it clearly suggests and teaches towards what is claimed as an invention IN720, thus rendering claims 1 and 2 of IN720 obvious for a person of skill in the art. Hence, on the basis of the teachings of EP881 read with above cited arts, IN720 is obvious and lacks inventive step.


Teachings of WO 2002/090334

102. 	Another prior art on the basis of which IN720 lacks
inventive step is WO334. The present Patent has also been
filed by the same entity i.e., Kudos Pharmaceuticals and even has at least two common inventors.

103. It is respectfully submitted that, on the basis of specific disclosure in WO334, IN720 lacks inventive step. For the perusal of this Honble court, the specific teachings of WO334 which results in the final product claimed in IN720 is reproduced herein:

The complete specification at page no. 5 reproduces the following compound

	
wherein:

A-B together represent an optionally substituted aromatic ring One of the RC1 and RC2 is -CH2-RL and other of RC1 and RC2 is H RL is optionally substituted Phenyl; and

RN is hydrogen

On page 17 placitum 20 onwards, Further preferences of substitution is discussed as:

It is preferred that only one of RC1 And RC2 is represented by -L-RL, and the other of RC1 and RC2 is H

On Page 17 Placitum 25
The fused aromatic ring(s) represented by -A-B- preferably consist of solely carbon ring and thus may be Benzene, naphthalene and is more preferably Benzene.

On page 17 placitum 31

RN is preferably selected from hydrogen.

On Page 18 placitum 28

RL is preferably C5-20 aryl, and more preferably a benzene ring, naphthalene, pyridine, 1,3-benzodioxole or furan.
When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The one or more substituents may be selected from: C1-7 alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20 aryl, C3-20 heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and amido; amino (including sulphonamide), more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino;
acylamido, including ureido groups, where the acyl or amino substituents is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulphoxide; sulphone

On Page 14 placitum 8 amido group is explained as:

Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C (=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -C(=0)N(CH3)2, -
C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and -C (=0)N (CH2CH3) 2, as well as amido groups in which R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .

104. 	It is respectfully submitted that the only difference that WO334 shows is the specific substitution of Nitrogen (N) at RC2. If the teachings of WO334 are read together with WO576, it makes it obvious for the person skilled in the art to reach Olaparib now claimed in IN720.

105. It is further submitted that such specific disclosure regarding the substitutions and the fact that the application
has been filed by the same applicant and have at least 2 common inventors clearly shows that the product claimed in IN720 was always within the knowledge of Plaintiff 1 and that the filing IN720 was an attempt at protecting an import monopoly and evergreening of patent protection for
Olaparib.

106. On the basis of above disclosures in the above cited prior arts read alone or in combination, it is respectfully submitted that IN720 lacks inventive step and/or is obvious.

48.	A bare reading of the afore-extracted paragraphs from the written statement of Natco indicates that Natco is arriving at chemical structure of Olaparib, in the case of each of the referred prior art inventions, by choosing select radicals out of the several suggested substitutions in the complete specifications of the prior art patents.  There is not a whisper of an averment, in the written statement, to justify such preferential selection.  By way of example, when Natco picks the amido radical out of a choice of carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and amido, or carbylamino and its alkylcarbylamino derivative out of a choice of alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, the written statement does not indicate why Natco chooses to make that particular choice.  Nor does it contain anything to indicate that the teachings in the suggested prior arts would lead a person skilled in the art to make that particular selection.  The exercise undertaken by Natco is, therefore, clearly an exercise of hindsight reconstruction, armed with prior knowledge of the necessary radicals which are to be substituted onto the Markush Claim I of the genus patent IN218 in order to arrive at claim I of the species patent IN720, by cherry-picking the appropriate radicals for substitution. Such hindsight operation, prima facie, demolishes the plea, of Natco that Claim I in the suit patent is obvious from the genus patent, or, for that reason, that the species patent is vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of want of inventive step, under Section 64(1)(f) of the Patents Act.

49.	Indeed, if Olaparib were so obvious from the suggested prior arts, there is no explanation why it took 19 years, after the genus patent had been granted, for Natco to synthesize Olaparib.  Even as an old patent, which has weathered 19 years of uninfringed existence, therefore, the suit patent is entitled to protection.

V.	Re. allegation of anticipation by prior claiming  Section 64(1)(a)

48.  Section 64(1)(a) has also come up for analyses by this Court in FMC-II, and paras 107 and 109 to 112 of the said decision may in this context be thus reproduced:
107. 	Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of the said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in the complete specification of another patent granted in India. The statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the complete specification of another patent granted in India (for ease of reference, the prior patent). A defendant who seeks to allege invalidity, or vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a), therefore, predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent was valid. An allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to any challenge to the validity of the suit patent under Section 64(1)(a). The defendant in the present case, in asserting vulnerability of IN307 as having been anticipated by prior claiming in Claim 22 of IN978, therefore, has to accede to the validity of Claim 22 of IN978.

*****



109. 	CTPR is the invention claimed in Claim 1 of the complete specification in IN307, i.e. the suit patent. The valid claim of earlier priority date in the prior patent, for the purposes of Section 64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of IN978. Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent vulnerable if CTPR is, prima facie, claimed in Claim 22 of IN978.

110. 	I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is not claimed, or even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN978. Claim 22 of IN978 claims a Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said Markush moiety to Claim 1 in IN307, or to CTPR, only by cherry picking select radicals out of the innumerable choices provided in the complete specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN978, for substitution on said Markush moiety. Save and except for demonstrating how, by substituting such select radicals, it is possible to move from the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN978 to Claim 1 of IN307, or to CTPR, the defendant has, in its written statement, not indicated any teaching or guidance, available in the complete specifications of IN278, as would guide a person skilled in the art to pick the select radicals and substitute them on the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN978, so as to lead him to CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the Markush formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN307, is obvious from the disclosure provided in Claim 22 of IN978.

111. 	The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as is apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written submissions filed by the defendant that Claim 22 of IN978 encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the impugned patent IN307, thereby rendering the entirety of the principal claim of IN 307 vulnerable to revocation. The correctness of this argument of the defendant appears to be somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears to be contrary to the contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words used in Section 13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While advancing this contention, the defendant has introduced two new concepts, which find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of scope and coverage. Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a claim in the suit patent is claimed in any claim of any other complete specification. It does not make any reference either to the scope of the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required therefore, prima facie, is comparison of the claims, not whether the claim in the suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the claim in the genus patent. This position is also conceded by the defendant, in its written submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily, a challenge of anticipation by prior claiming has to be decided on a claim-to-claim comparison. The defendant would seek to contend that, in the present case, this exercise is obviated because of the admission - as the defendant would perceive it - by the plaintiff, in its plaint and replication, of the coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of IN978. No such admission is, as already held here in before, discernible from the paragraphs on which the defendant seeks to place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, even as per the defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine the applicability of Section 64(1)(a) - or, for that matter, Section 13(1)(b) - to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these provisions apply.

112. 	The defendant has made a strained effort to justify invocation of Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if Claim 1 in IN307 includes variants which were outside the scope of Claim 22 in IN978, the former claim was, nonetheless, rendered prima facie vulnerable to the extent it fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN978, i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR. Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor Section 64(1)(a), in my considered opinion, lends itself to such an interpretation. All that these provisions require the Court - or authority before whom the challenge to the validity is raised - to do is to assess whether the invention, insofar as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or was not, claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is not claimed in Claim 22 of IN978. The highest that the defendant can assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an arthropodicidal anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush coverage of Claim 22 of IN978. In the discussion here in before, I have already opined that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot be that CTPR has been claimed in Claim 22 of IN978.

49. As has been correctly contended by Mr. Pravin Anand, a plea of vulnerability of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming can successfully be raised only if the claim in the suit patent has been claimed in a patent of an earlier priority date. There must, therefore, be identity of claims.  Para 16 of the written submissions filed by Mr. Sai Deepak, it is asserted, in this regard, thus:
16.	From the above it is clear that anticipation by prior claiming u/Sec. 64(1)(a) is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product but is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the
complete specification. After all, what the patentee can assert against third parties in the form of a sword must be equally available to the third parties as a shield to defend themselves against the patentees claim of infringement. Any other interpretation of the statutory scheme would defeat the manifest legislative intent and that too in a critical realm such as the pharmaceutical industry. The concept of enabling disclosure may at
best be applicable with respect to the ground of anticipation by prior publication, but not in the context of anticipation by prior claiming since Sec. 64(1)(a) is meant to act as a fetter on the patentees ability to evergreen its right to sue based on the claim and is therefore not contingent on the scope or specificity of the disclosure. Therefore, to apply the test of enabling disclosure in the context of 64(1)(a) is to foist on it one of the possible standards which may be applicable to Sec. 64(1)(e).

50. The assertions in the afore-extracted passage from the written submissions of Mr. Sai Deepak, in my view, is based on a fundamentally erroneous legal premise. 

51. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that a claim of vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product, but is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the complete specification.  It is further sought to be contended that specificity of disclosure may be a relevant test for Section 64(1)(e), but cannot be regarded as a relevant test for Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act.

52. The view expressed by me in FMC-II, as already extracted hereinabove, compels me to disagree with Mr. Sai Deepaks submissions.  In my view, Section 64(1)(a) is clear and categorical in the words it uses.  It states that the invention, so far as claimed in the suit patent, has to have been claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date for the suit patent to be regarded as vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming.  There has, therefore, to be identity of claims.  The claim asserted in the suit patent, must have been claimed in a complete specification relating to a patent of earlier priority date.  Then, and only then, can a plea of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming be successfully laid.

53. A claim is even more specific than a disclosure.  On a plain claim to claim comparison, it is clear that Olaparib, as Claim I in the suit patent IN720, has never been claimed in any earlier patent to which Mr. Sai Deepak draws attention.  The Markush structure claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN218 certainly cannot be said to claim Claim I in the suit patent IN720.  As such, no prima facie case of anticipation by prior claiming can be said to exist.

Reliance on Form 27s, PTE applications by Kudos in Australia and Korea and Eurasian patent EU 006300 and Russian patent RU 2755865

54. Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to place reliance on the Forms 27 filed by Kudos in respect of IN720 and IN218, the PTE applications filed by Kudos in Australia and Korea and the identity of the Eurasian and Russian equivalents of alleged identity of the claims in Russian patent RU865 with the claims in IN720.

55. I do not see how this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC, can delve into such depth of detail.  It is true, this Court has, in earlier decisions, done so.  However, in view of the note of caution sounded by the Supreme Court in Pernod Ricard, I am of the opinion that some kind of rethink is necessary on this aspect.  There is no denying the fact that orders on applications filed in pharma patent cases for interim relief often go into such depth of details that practically nothing remains for adjudication in the suit.  This may not be an acceptable way of proceeding.

56. Particularly when dealing with a challenge to the validity of the suit patent on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, once the Court finds, on facts, by claim to claim comparison, that there is no anticipation by prior claiming, statements made in other jurisdictions, or in documents filed by the plaintiffs elsewhere, cannot make out a case of anticipation by prior claiming, even at the prima facie stage.  ought not to legitimately form part of the consideration.  The plaintiffs would have, during the course of trial, every opportunity to explain the circumstances in which such statements were made, and before grant of such opportunity, where a prima facie clear case of lack of anticipation of prior claiming is made out, the matter must rest there, when dealing with an Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications.  

57. I have nonetheless reproduced, in this regard, the defence raised by Mr. Anand to the various points raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, and for the purposes of adjudicating the present Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications, suffice it to state that the challenges have not been left unanswered.  The response by Mr. Praveen Anand raises, at the very least, triable issues.  When, on a claim to claim comparison, no case of anticipation of prior claiming is found to exist, it cannot be said that the defendant has raised a credible challenge on that ground.

VI.	Re. Anticipation by prior publication  Section 64(1)(e) 

58. Anticipation by prior publication has also been dealt with, by this Bench, in its decisions in FMC-II and Novartis I.  Paras 117 to 118, 124 to 128 and 133 of FMC-II and para 222 of Novartis I may, in this context, be reproduced thus:
From FMC-II

117. 	Section 64(1)(e) states where the invention, so far as claimed in the suit patent, is not new, having regard to either (i) what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent or (ii) what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Unlike Section 64(1)(a), therefore, which is a self-contained provision, Section 64(1)(e) refers us back to Section 13. Sub-sections (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13 are relevant, and maybe reproduced thus:
13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim -
(1) 	The examiner to whom an application for a patent is referred under section 12 shall make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification -
(a) 	has been anticipated by publication before the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and dated on or after the 1st day of January, 1912;
*****
(2) 	The examiner shall, in addition, make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining, whether the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, has been anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere in any document other than those mentioned in subsection (1) before the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification.

118. 	Whether under clause (1)(a) or (2), what Section 13 requires is publication of the invention, claimed in the suit patent, in any document, before the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit patent.
      xxxxx
124. 	Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new. This necessarily refers us back to the definition of new invention in clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning any invention or technology which has not been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the country or elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of patent application with complete specification, i.e., the subject matter has not fallen in public domain or that it does not form part of the state of the art. Anticipation, when used in the Patents Act, has its own peculiar legal connotation. Though anticipation, per se, is not separately defined, Section 13 provides for anticipation only by prior publication or by prior claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability of a patent to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior publication. In order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute the basis for revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary that, consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer new; which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its character as a new invention, by reason of anticipation by prior publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a new invention. This is counterbalanced by the definition of new invention, which envisages absence of novelty either on account of anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in the present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior use of the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case having been pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss of novelty on the ground of anticipation by prior publication.

125. 	Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly - and significantly - worded. The words before the priority date of the claim succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words what was publicly known or publicly used in India. No such caveat as to time follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated, in Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit patent. The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit patent, does not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the manner in which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the legislature.

126. 	That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of prior publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e), is completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem. What, then, is the terminus ad quem, for the purposes of prior publication under Section 64(1)(e)? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to provide a terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with the prior publication, apparently because this part of the clause is to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which provides the appropriate terminus ad quem, in clauses (1)(a) and (2), which have already been reproduced hereinabove, and which envisage anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad quem provided in respect of anticipation by prior publication, in clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13, is the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification, and not the priority date of the suit patent. The priority date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima facie irrelevant for the purposes of vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with Section 13 of the Patents Act. What has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in the present case, was published in India or elsewhere in any document.

127. 	Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an invention without disclosure of the invention in the patent?

128. 	Publication involves making known to the public the patent application. Every application is required to disclose the invention for which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents Act4 (already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in the complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention, its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, but also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to be able to successfully allege that CTPR was published in US424 and US357 (being the US equivalent of EP508), the defendant would have to establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents.
      xxxxx
133. 	Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR. Besides, they are pharmaceutical patents, relating to pharmaceutical products for therapeutic administration. There is also substance in Mr. Sethi's contention that these are also Markush claims, and cannot, therefore, be said to teach synthesising of CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to convince myself that CTPR stands claimed, or disclosed, in these patents. Sans any claim or disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that CTPR was published either in US424 or US357 (or, therefore, in EP508).

      From Novartis-I
      
222. 	Section 64(1)(e) envisages, as a ground for revocation of a patent, that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. The plea of vulnerability of the suit patent IN 161 on the ground of anticipation by prior publication, as advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak, is predicated on the latter half of this Clause. Section 64(1)(e) refers back to Section 13. Anticipation by publication finds reference in Clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13. Section 13(1)(a) refers to anticipation by publication of the applicant's complete specifications in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and does not, therefore, apply to the ground taken by Mr. Sai Deepak. Section 13(2) refers to anticipation by publication of the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, by publication in India or elsewhere in any document before the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit patent. The use of the expression so far as claimed, in Section 13(2) would, therefore, require identity in the extent of claim contained in the specification in the suit patent and in the specification of the prior art which is cited for the purpose of alleging anticipation by prior publication.

59. In para 126 of FMC-II, this Bench has clearly rejected Mr. Sai Deepaks contention that the terminus ad quem for determining anticipation by prior publication is the priority date of the suit patent.   It is held, in the said para, that the priority date of the suit patent is prima facie irrelevant, while examining vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior publication and that, when Section 64(1)(e) is read with Section 13 of the Patents Act, what has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit patent, the asserted invention was published in India or elsewhere in any document.

60. Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the genus patent WO 2002/36576 (WO576), equivalent to IN218 to contend that Claim 1 in the suit patent, i.e. Olaparib, stands anticipated by prior publication in WO576.  He relies, for this purpose, on Compound 278 in WO576, and the process of its synthesis as reflected in the complete specifications in WO576. 


61. It is obvious at a bare glance that the product compound 278 is not Olaparib. 

62. Para 83 of the written statement sets out, in a tabular fashion, the manner in which WO576 allegedly anticipates, by prior publication, Olaparib:
WO576
IN720
WO576 discloses the following
Compound




wherein A-B, RN and RC can be
optionally substituted.
Page 4 of the description states the second aspect of the present invention wherein A and B together represent an optionallysubstituted, fused aromatic ringRC is -CH2-RL;
RL is optionally substituted phenyl; and
RN is hydrogen.

Substitution of A-B
Page 6 of the complete specification
describes aromatic ring as follows:
The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein
in the conventional sense to refer to a
cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclicstructure having delocalised n-electronorbitals.
Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:
In one group of preferred embodiments,
the aromatic group comprises a single
aromatic ring, which has five or six ringatoms, which ring atoms are selectedfrom carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, andsulphur, and which ring is optionallysubstituted. Examples of these groupsinclude benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole,thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole.
IN720 claims the following
Compound


















Compound at the place of A-B (in  IN218) enclosed above shows an aromatic ring i.e., Benzene

Substitution of RL
Page 18 of the description doc:
RL is preferably a benzene ring,
naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3-
benzodioxole, and more preferably a
benzene ringWhen RL is a benzene ring, it ispreferably substituted. The one or moresubstituents may be selected from: C1-7alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20aryl; C3-20heterocyclyl; halo, more
preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more
preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy,and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonylgroups, such as carboxy, ester andamido; amino (including sulfonamide),more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, andcycloamino groups, such as morpholino;acylamido including ureido groupswhere the acyl or amino substituent ispreferably phenyl, which itself isoptionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol;thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.





Compound at the place of RC (inIN218) shows substitution of RLwhereinRL is selected from amido group andoptionally further substituted withFluorine (F)

On page 15 of the description Preferred substituents of the benzene ring, when RLis phenyl is given, which includes:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl,aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limitedto, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -
C(=0)N(CH3)2, -C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and-C (=0)N (CH2CH3) 2, as well as amidogroups in which R1 and R2, togetherwith the nitrogen atom to which theyare attached, form a heterocyclicstructure as in, for example,piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .

Substitution of RN
RN is hydrogen.


The substitution at the place of RN (in IN218) is Hydrogen (H) as stated in the claim of IN218


63. It is clear, from a bare glance at the manner in which Natco has arrived at the chemical structure of Olaparib from Claim I in WO576 that there has been cherry picking of substituents.  For example, 
(i) in the A-B radical in the WO576 claim, there is no explanation for why the example of benzene has been selected out of the possible substituents of 5- to 6- membered aromatic rings, out of 
(a) benzene, 
(b) pyrazine, 
(c) pyrrole, 
(d) thiazole, 
(e) isoxazole and 
(f) oxazole, 
which, too, are merely mentioned as examples, and
(ii) in the -CH2-RL substitution, while the description of WO576 does state that RL, if a benzene ring, is preferably substituted, there is no explanation for why the halo and carbonyl substituents should be selected in preference to 
(a) C1-7 alkyl (more preferably methyl), 
(b) CF3,
(c) C5-20 aryl,
(d) C3-20 heterocyclyl,
(e) hydroxy,
(f) ether (more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy and cyclopentyloxy),
(g) nitro, and
(h) cyano,
among others.  Most significantly, perhaps, there is no teaching, in any of the cited prior arts, to lead a person skilled in the art to envision the terminal  cyclopropane substitution.  

64. No other prior publication, which publishes Olaparib, has been cited by Mr. Sai Deepak either during oral arguments or in written submissions. 

65. No case for anticipation by prior publication is also, therefore, made out.  

VII.	Section 3(d)29

66. Mr. Sai Deepak has also sought to invoke Section 3(d) of the Patents Act to contend that the specifications for Olaparib do not contain any data to indicate enhanced efficacy over the prior art IN218.  

67. The fallacy of the submission is obvious.  Section 3(d), to the extent it is at all relevant to the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, applies only to new forms of known substances.   It cannot be said that Olaparib is a new form of the Markush Claim I in IN720.  The submission, therefore, merits prima facie rejection.

VIII.	Section 64(1)(m) read with Section 830

68. On the ground that, while applying for and obtaining the suit patent, Kudos did not disclose the fact that its applications for grant of the same patent JP 2006-505955 and JP 2007-226723 were facing rejection.  This, in my opinion, cannot be a basis, in any case, for Kudos to be regarded as disentitled to an injunction.  At the very least, the matter would be a question of fact, to be decided on the facts of each individual case.  

69. Besides, Section 8 requires the patent applicant in India, who is prosecuting an application for a patent in another country outside India in respect of the same invention, to file, along with his application, a statement setting out the particulars of the application.  The issue of whether, in a case where the patent is registered, or being prosecuted, in several other jurisdictions, the omission to mention the proceedings before one jurisdiction would invalidate the granted patent altogether is, in my prima facie view, highly arguable.  Even more arguable would be the question of whether, if the omission is bona fide, the patentee, whose patent is admittedly infringed, can be refused an interim injunction.  

70. In the present case, Kudos has placed, on record, documents, including correspondences with its patent agent, which, according to it, indicate that the omission to mention the Japanese patents was not deliberate, but was an inadvertent omission on the part of the patent agent.  How far this argument would be acceptable is, in my view, a matter which would have to await trial.  In any event, in view of the explanation, this cannot be regarded as so overwhelming a factor as would justify rejection of the interim relief that Kudos seeks.

IX.	The sequitur

71. As already noted towards beginning of this judgment, several incidental contentions were raised, including IC 50 values, dosage data, anti-cancer PARP inhibition data, and the like, all of which would require a detailed excursion into facts.  It would not be justified for this Court to enter into all these areas, once a prima facie case has been found to exist in favour of the plaintiff.  For the purposes of the present application, it is admitted, in the first place, that the defendant is in fact exploiting the suit patent by manufacturing and selling Olaparib.    It is also admitted that this exploitation has take place in the 19th year of the life of the suit patent.  No credible case of vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on any of the grounds contained in Section 64 of the Patents Act can be said to have been made out by the Natco.  As no credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent has been made out, the prayer for interlocutory injunction has necessarily to be granted.

Conclusion

72. For all the aforesaid reasons, the present application succeeds and is allowed.  The defendant shall stand restrained from manufacturing and selling, or in any manner, dealing with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or under other brand name, pending disposal of the present suit, so long as the suit patent continues to remain alive and subsisting.
  
73. I.A. 907/2023 is allowed accordingly.

IA 153/2023 in CO (Comm. IPD-PAT) 1/2023

74. By this application, Natco seeks an interlocutory injunction staying the operation of the suit patent and restraining Kudos from seeking any injunction against Natco exploiting the suit patent.

75. No separate submissions have been advanced in this application.  In any event, the outcome of I.A 907/2023 in CS (Comm) 29/2023 would necessarily also determine the outcome of the present applications.

76. Resultantly, I.A. 153/2023 is dismissed.

                                                                          C.HARI SHANKAR, J

I.A. 907/2023 in CS(COMM) 29/2023
1. Kudos Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Kudos” hereinafter) is the
registered proprietor of Indian Patent IN 228720 (IN’ 720) (hereinafter
referred to as “the suit patent”), issued on 12 March 2004 for a period
of 20 years. The patent certificate was granted for an invention
entitled “Phthalazinone derivative”.
2. Claim I of the suit patent read thus:
“1. A Phthalazione derivative of the following formula.
Or isomers, salts or solvates thereof.
3. The application for grant of Suit Patent was filed in India on 31
August 2005 with a priority date of 12 March 2003. It was granted by
the Indian Patent Office (IPO) on 10 February 2009.
4. There has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit
patent. It is only after the present suit was filed that the defendant
Natco Pharma Limited (“Natco” hereinafter) filed CO (COMM.IPD-CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 3of69PAT) 1/2023 under Section 64(1)1of the Patents Act, 1970 (“1970”),
seeking revocation of the suit patent.
5. The compound claimed in Claim I of the suit patent has been
assigned the IUPAC name “Olaparib”.
6. There is no dispute that, even while the suit patent continues to
remain alive and subsisting, Natco has manufactured and sold its own
generic version of Olaparib under the brand name BRACANAT.
7. This, contends Kudos, amounts to infringement of the suit
patent. Kudos has, therefore, instituted the present suit before this
Court seeking a decree of permanent injunction, restraining Natco
164. Revocation of patent-
(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted before or after the
commencement of this Act, may, be revoked on a petition of any person interested or of the Central
Government by the Appellate Board or on a counter-claim in a suit for infringement of the patent by
the High Court on any of the following grounds, that is to say—
(a) that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification,
was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete
specification of another patent granted in India;
*****
(e) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is
not new, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the
priority date of the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the
documents referred to in section 13;
(f) that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is
obvious or does not involve any inventive step, having regard to what was publicly known
or publicly used in India or what was published in India or elsewhere before the priority
date of the claim;
*****
(h) that the complete specification does not sufficiently and fairly describe the
invention and the method by which it is to be performed, that is to say, that the description
of the method or the instructions for the working of the invention as contained in the
complete specification are not by themselves sufficient to enable a person in India
possessing average skill in, and average knowledge of, the art to which the invention
relates, to work the invention, or that it does not disclose the best method of performing it
which was known to the applicant for the patent and for which he was entitled to claim
protection;
*****
(m) that the applicant for the patent has failed to disclose to the Controller the information
required by Section 8 or has furnished information which in any material particular was
false to his knowledge;CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 4of69from manufacturing or selling or otherwise dealing with any product
with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or otherwise.
8. Olaparib, it may be noted, is an oral poly (ADP- ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, used for treating various forms of
cancer. It is stated that, by inhibiting PARP, Olaparib preferentially
kills cancer cells. The mechanics by which Olaparib acts as an anti-
cancer drug are not of particular significance, insofar as the present
decision is concerned.
9. Along with the suit, the plaintiff has filed IA 907/2023 under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
(CPC), seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants
from manufacturing or selling Olaparib, under any brand name,
pending disposal of the present suit.
10. This judgment disposes of the said IA 907 of 2023 and I.A.
153/2023 in C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023.
A prefatory note
11. In para 15 of the report in Astrazeneca v. Intas2, the Division
Bench of this Court has entered the following cautionary note, in the
matter of passing of interlocutory orders in intellectual property
matters:
“15. Supreme Court, in order dated 16thAugust, 2017 in Civil
Appeal No. 18892/2017 titled AZ Tech (India) v.Intex
2(2021) 87 PTC 374 (DB) , hereinafter referred to as “ Astrazeneca-I ”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 5of69Technologies (India) Limited , commented on the disturbing trend,
of the orders of disposal of applications for interim relief in
Intellectual Property Rights matters governing parties for a long
time, with exhaustive judgments, virtually on merits of the suit,
being written and expressed the need for addressing the said
malady. In fact, suo moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8/2017 titled Re
: Case Management of Original Suits , was initiated in pursuance
to the said order and in which proceedings this Court informed the
Supreme Court of the remedial measures being taken.”
12. More recently, the Supreme Court, in Pernod Ricard India Pvt.
Ltd. v. United Spirits Ltd3, echoed the above sentiment in the
following words:
“At the insistence of counsel for the petitioner, we clarify that it is
well settled proposition of law that decisions on interlocutory
applications are only made to protect rival interests pending suit.
Somehow the interim applications itself are treated as final
decision but it is not so. In all such cases, interim arrangements
should be made and the trial should proceed rather than to spend
time only on interlocutory applications. That protects the petitioner
against the apprehension that the impugned judgment may be cited
in other Court qua petitioner’s cases of a similar nature.”
13. The present order is passed on an interlocutory application
under Order XXXIX of the CPC. All that the Court has to see,
therefore, is whether there is a prima facie case in favour of the
plaintiff, whether the refusal of interim relief would result in
irreparable loss to the plaintiff, and which way the balance of
convenience would lie. A threadbare analysis of the entire dispute,
and findings which partake of a final expression of opinion on all
issues in controversy, is neither justified, nor even appropriate, at this
stage.
3Order dated 6September 2023 in SLP (C) 17674/2023CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 6of6914. Arguments in this case extended over several days. Written
submissions have also been tendered by both sides, with the
submissions of the plaintiff extending to 53 pages. If I were to return
findings on every issue argued, and on every plea urged, hardly
anything would survive for consideration in the suit.
15. The attempt is, therefore, to ensure that this order conforms to
the discipline of Order XXXIX of the CPC.
Rival Contentions
16. I have heard Mr. Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Kudos, and
Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the Natco at exhaustive length.
Submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand
17. Mr. Pravin Anand advanced the following submissions to justify
his prayer for interlocutory injunction:
(i) Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in Claim I
of the suit patent IN’720.
(ii) During the life of the suit patent and till the filing of C.O.
(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023, there has been no pre-grant or post-
grant opposition to the suit patent, which stands granted in as
many as 61 countries.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 7of69(iii) The first act of infringement of the suit patent, by Natco,
has taken place when the suit patent is in the 19thyear of its life.
The suit patent is, therefore, an old patent and is, therefore, prima
facie entitled to be treated as valid, strong and liable to be
enforced against third party infringers.
(iv) Olaparib was also covered by IN 245218 (IN’218)
registered in favor of the plaintiff which expired on 25 October
2021 titled ‘Substituted Benzyl Phthalazinones’.
(v) Claim I in IN’720 was as under :
“WE CLAIM:
A compound of the formula :
Or an isomer, salt, solvate, chemically protected form, and
prodrug thereof, wherein :
A and B together represent an optionally mono-
substituted, fused aromatic ring: Rc is -CH2-RL;
RL is phenyl substituted by a substituent selected from the
group consisting of :
C3-20 heterocyclyl; esler; amido; ureido; sulfonamino;
and acyloxy and optionally further substituted; and
RN is hydrogen.”
This is a Markush claim which covers, depending on the
selected substitutions from the suggested substitutions provided
in the claim, a large number of compounds – worked out in theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 8of69written submission of the plaintiff as in the range of 93600
million. This figure is not disputed by Natco. One among these
is Olaparib.
(vi) Thus, IN’218 neither claims nor discloses Olaparib.
Olaparib is merely one of the millions of compounds which fall
within the broad Markush coverage of Claim I in IN’218.
(vii) The specifications in IN’218 do not contain the necessary
teaching to guide a person skilled in the art to synthesize
Olaparib.
(viii) Natco is admittedly manufacturing and selling Olaparib.
Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in the suit patent
IN’720. The fact that Natco is infringing the suit patent,
therefore, stands admitted.
(ix) Natco has not cleared the way before infringing the suit
patent. It has not filed any pre or post grant opposition to the
suit patent. C.O. (COMM.) IPD-PAT 1/2023 has also been filed
by Natco only after the present suit was instituted by Kudos.
The very fact that Natco chose to launch its own generic version
of Olaparib, admittedly infringing the suit patent, without, in
the first instance, clearing the way, entitles Kudos to
interlocutory injunction.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 9of69(x) Clearing the way, moreover, would require Natco not to
just to file a revocation petition challenging the suit patent, but
also to succeed in its challenge. For the proposition that the
very act of infringing of the suit patent without Natco having
first clear the way entitles Kudos to an interim injunction, Mr.
Anand relies on para 87 of the report in Merck Sharp and
Dohme Corporation v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals4passed by
the Division Bench of this Court, the decision of the UK High
Court Actavis v. Lilly5and on the decision of the UK Court of
Appeal in Novartis AG v. Hospira6.
(xi) While it is true that, to justifiably oppose a prayer for
interim injunction, the defendant in a patent infringement suit is
only required to set up a credible challenge to the validity of the
suit patent, it cannot be said that Natco has set up such a
challenge.
(xii) InF . Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla Ltd7and Intex
Technologies (India) Ltd. v. Telefonaktiebolaget L.M.
Ericsson8, a credible challenge has been identified as one which
is strong, and which is not fanciful or moonshine. In assessing
whether a challenge is credible, the Division Bench in both
these decisions has held that the fact that the inventor had been
granted a patent for his invention after thorough scrutiny by the
4(2015) 63 PTC 257 , hereinafter referred to as “ Merck ”.
52015 EWHC 1955
62013 EWCA (Civ) 583
7(2009) 40 PTC 125(DEL) , hereinafter referred to as “ Roche-I ”.
82023 SCC OnLine Del 1845, hereinafter referred to as “ Intex ”.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 10of69Indian Patent Office was a relevant factor which had to be
accorded due weightage.
(xiii) The fact that no pre-grant or post-grant opposition had
been filed to the suit patent, till Natco decided to file a
revocation petition in the 19thyear of the life of the suit patent is
also a recognition of the validity of the suit patent and a factor
which entitles Kudos to interim injunction, applying the law
laid down by the House of Lords in American Cyanamide v.
Ethicon Ltd9.
(xiv) On the erroneous presumption that coverage implies
disclosure, Natco was seeking to incorrectly contend that
Olaparib stood disclosed in IN’218. In actual fact, coverage
and disclosure are distinct and different concepts. Coverage
does not imply disclosure. The fact that coverage and disclosure
are different and distinct stand acknowledged by the Supreme
Court in its judgment in Novartis AG v. UOI10as well as by the
Division Bench of Court in para 11.18.7 of its decision in FMC
Corporation v. Natco Pharma Ltd.11and by this Bench in
Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd12.
(xv) Disclosure of a chemical compound in a patent is done
only through an individual identification of that compound in
the patent document by its chemical name, chemical structure,
91975 UK HL 1
10(2013) 6 SCC 1
112023 SCC OnLine Del 106 , hereinafter referred to as “ FMC-I ”.
12(2023) SCC OnLine Del 106, hereinafter referred to as “ Novartis-I”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 11of69chemical formula, IUPAC name etc. Reliance is placed, for this
purpose, on paras 283 and 329 of the judgment of the Federal
Court of Australia in Eli-Lilly and Co. Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd .13
(xvi) InFMC-I , the Division Bench held that disclosure of a
compound in a genes patent cannot be presumed.
(xvii) The Supreme Court, in its judgment in Biswanath
Prasad v. Hindustan Metal Industries14and the US Court of
Appeals in Fujikawa v. Wattanasin15hold that the issue of
disclosure of a patent in specifications is a question of fact,
which has to be proved by clear and convincing evidence.
(xviii) There is a difference between coverage and claiming.
The fact that Olaparib is covered under the overall Markush
claim in IN’218 does not result in Olaparib being vulnerable to
invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.
(xix) In order for a claim in a patent to be invalided on the
ground of prior claiming, the invention in the two claims must
be identical. The Markush Claim I in IN’218 is clearly different
from Claim I in the suit patent which specifically claims and
discloses Olaparib. This has been sought to be demonstrated
thus:
132013 FCA 214, hereinafter referred to as “ Eli Lilly ”.
14(1979) 2 SCC 511
1529 USP Q. 2d 1895CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 12of69
In the genus patent IN’218, though millions of compounds
could be synthesized from the Markush Claim I, only 265
compounds were exemplified, and Olaparib was not one
amongst them. In order for a claim in a species patent to be
invalidated on the ground of prior claim in the genus patent, the
disclosure in the genus patent must be enabling; in other words,
it must enable a person skilled in the art to arrive at the species
patent from the teachings which it provides. Reliance is placed,
for this purpose, on The General Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. v.
Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd.16
(xx) There can be no question of double patenting or prior
claiming where the scope of earlier and later patent is different.
(xxi) In order to support his contention that the mere coverage
of the claim in the species patent, in the overall Markush
structure in the genus patent does not invalidate the species
patent on the ground of prior claiming, Mr. Anand relies on para
63.2 to 63.6 of Novartis-I , paras 12.5, 12.7 & 12.18 of the
judgment of this Bench in FMC Corporation v. Best Crop
16(1971) FSR 417CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 13of69Science LLP17and paras 191, 192 and 195 of Novartis AG v.
Natco Pharma Ltd.18, paras 10.5 to 10.8 of Astrazeneca v.
Torrent19andparas 26 to 30 of the Judgment of the UK Court
of Appeal in Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly
and Co. Ltd20.
(xxii) If Natco’s submissions were to be accepted, it would
invalidate all selection patents, which are recognized in this
country. Natco was seeking to contend that all species patents
were patents of addition under Section 3421and had, therefore,
necessarily to terminate with the genus patent. This was a
seriously flawed submission, and went against the well-
recognized theory of selection patents. Selection patents were
valid subject to their satisfying the three factor test, postulated
inRe. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.’s Patents22,followed by this
Court in its decision in FMC-I .
(xxiii) The suit patent could not be treated as a patent of addition
under Section 5423of the Patents Act, as was sought to be
17(2021) 87 PTC 217, hereinafter referred to as “ FMC-II ”
18(2021) SCC OnLine Del 5340, hereinafter referred to as “ Novartis-II”

2134. No anticipation if circumstances are only as described in sections 29,30, 31 and 32-
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the Controller shall not refuse to grant a patent, and a patent
shall not be revoked or invalidated by reason only of any circumstances which, by virtue of section 29 or
section 30 or section 31 or section 32, do not constitute an anticipation of the invention claimed in the
specification.
22(1930) 47 RPC 289 (Ch D)
2354. Patents of addition-
(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this section, where an application is made for a
patent in respect of any improvement in or modification of an invention described or disclosed in
the complete specification filed therefor (in this Act referred to as the ""main invention"") and the
applicant also applies or has applied for a patent for that invention or is the patentee in respect
thereof, the Controller may, if the applicant so requests, grant the patent for the improvement or
modification as a patent of addition.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 14of69contended by Natco. A patent of addition was filed with respect
to minor improvements over an invention described or
disclosed in an earlier patent. Olaparib is neither described nor
disclosed in the genus patent IN’218. Moreover, Olaparib was
not a mere improvement over the genus patent but constitutes
an entirely new invention.
(xxiv) The reliance on Section 53(4)24of the Patents Act, by
Natco is also misplaced. Natco was seeking to contend that, by
operation of Section 53(4), the expiry of the genus patent
IN’218 resulted ipso facto in falling, into the public domain all
subject matter covered by the genus patent even if it was neither
claimed nor disclosed in it. This was a fundamentally
misplaced submission. The protection available under Section
53(4) was as much available to the species patents as to the
genus patent. It is well-settled that multiple patents can cover
the same product. In such a case, the expiry of genus patent
does not result automatically into expiry of the species patents
or evisceration of the protection available under Section 53(4)
to the species patent.
(2) Subject to the provisions contained in this section, where an invention, being an
improvement in or modification of another invention, is the subject of an independent patent and
the patentee in respect of that patent is also the patentee in respect of the patent for the main
invention, the Controller may, if the patentee so requests, by order, revoke the patent for the
improvement or modification and grant to the patentee a patent of addition in respect thereof,
bearing the same date as the date of the patent so revoked.
(3) A patent shall not be granted as a patent of addition unless the date of filing of the
application was the same as or later than the date of filing of the application in respect of the main
invention.
(4) A patent of addition shall not be granted before grant of the patent for the main invention.
2453. Term of Patent-
*****
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, on
cessation of the patent right due to non-payment of renewal fee or on expiry of the term of patent,
the subject matter covered by the said patent shall not be entitled to any protection.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 15of69(xxv) This was clear from the expression “notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in
force”, with which Section 53(4) commences. The Patents Act
could not be treated as “other law” for the purposes of Section
53(4). While, therefore, Section 53(4) had supervening
application over other laws, it was nonetheless subject to the
Patents Act and, especially, to Sections 19, 91(1) and 141 (1)
thereof. Reliance was placed, for the interpretation “any other
law” on the judgment of the Supreme Court in P .
Virudhachalam v. Management of Lotus Mills25. The correct
interpretation to be placed on Section 53 (4) was, therefore, that
all compounds disclosed by the genus patent would be open to
the public upon its expiry. Inasmuch as Olaparib was not
specifically disclosed in the genus patent IN’218, the expiry of
IN’218 did not render Olaparib available in the public domain
for anyone to exploit.
(xxvi) A plea that Olaparib was disclosed in the Russian Genus
Patent RU’865 was also incorrect. Natco was seeking to
contend that RU’865 – which was the Russian equivalent to
IN’218 – also claimed a medicament used to treat cancer via
PARP inhibition. The reliance on RU’865 was, however,
misplaced as RU’865 did not disclose that any drug, let alone
Olaparib, commercially emerged from RU’865.
25(1998) 1 SCC 650CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 16of69(xxvii) Natco had sought to rely on the Form 27s filed by
Kudos, for the genus patent IN’218 and the species patent
IN’720. The filing of Form 27 did not amount to any kind of
admission that Olaparib was specifically disclosed in both the
patents. One product can conceivably be covered by several
patents and several patents could cover a single commercial
product. This position stands statutorily recognized by Sections
3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141 of the Patents Act. The amended
form 27 requires all patentees to file a single Form 27 for
multiple patents, provided all patents are related or worked
through one product. As such, the fact that one Form 27 had
been filed both for species patent IN’720 and genus patent
IN’218 did not constitute any admission that both disclosed
Olaparib. They were merely related patents, as genie and
species patents respectively.
(xxviii) Similarly, the Patent Term Extension (PTE)
application filed by Kudos in respect of Australian Patent AU
2001295789 (AU’789) – which corresponded to the Indian
genus Patent IN’218 – was completely irrelevant and did not
constitute any admission that Olaparib was disclosed in the
genus patent. The Patents Act in Australia provides PTEs to
account for delay which could occur when obtaining regulatory
approvals for pharmaceuticals. Reliance has been placed, in
this context, on Sections 70 to 79A of the Australian Patents
Act 1990. The above legal position stands exposited by this
Court in paras 67, 67.1 and 67.2 of its judgment in Novartis-I .CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 17of69(xxix) In PCT application WO 2021/224381 of Kudos, there
was an inadvertent statement that Olaparib was disclosed in
WO’976, which corresponded to the genus patent IN’218.
Immediate corrective steps had been taken by Kudos to rectify
this error and it now stands clarified that Olaparib was
described in WO’976, which corresponds to IN’720, the species
patent. That this was an error is also manifested from the fact
that Kudos applied for several other patents related to Olaparib,
referring to WO’976 as the patent which described Olaparib.
Specific instances in this regard have been provided.
(xxx) The challenge to the validity of the suit patent IN’720 on
the ground that it suffered from insufficiency of disclosure
under Section 64(1)(h) was not one which could be examined
by the court at an interlocutory stage. It was a question of fact,
not a question of law, and would have to be decided only once
evidence was led and Kudos was granted an opportunity to
cross examine its witnesses. Reliance is placed, for this
purpose, on the judgment of this Court in Communication
Components Antenna Inc v. Mobi Antenna Technologies
(Shenzen) Co. Ltd.26and on Terrell on the Law of Patents .
(xxxi) Natco’s reliance on Section 8(2) to the Patents Act, vis-à-
visthe omission on Kudos part to reveal details of the Patent
Applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO),
26Manu/DE/0946/2022CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 18of69corresponding to the suit patent IN’720 during the time of
prosecution of the application resulting in its grant, before the
Indian Patent office, was also unsustainable. Reliance has been
placed, in this context, on a letter written to Kudos by its Agent
on 14 December 2007, informing Kudos of the Section 8
objection raised by the IPO and requesting Kudos to supply the
search and examination report for corresponding patent
applications filed in the US and Europe. Such an inadvertent,
unintentional error would not amount to violation of Section
8(2) so as to disentitle the patentee to interlocutory relief.
Reliance has been placed, in this context, on paras 27 and 28 of
the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Sukesh
Bahl v. K. Philips Electronics27and paras 123 to 125 of F .
Hoffman La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd28.In any case the Kudos
stood to gain nothing by suppressing the patent applications
filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), as both
applications had been granted.
(xxxii) Natco’s contention that the suit patent IN’720
suffered from lack of inventive step, as it had not demonstrated
any technical advance of Olaparib over prior art, was contrary
to the very words of Section 2(1) (ja) of the Patents Act, which
defined “inventive step” as meaning “a feature of an invention
that involves technical advance compared to the existing
knowledge orhaving economic significance orboth,and that
makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art”.
272015 SCC OnLine Del 2313
28148 (2008) DLT 598 (hereinafter referred to as “ Roche-II ”)CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 19of69As such, technical advance over prior art is not a mandatory
pre-requisite for an inventive step to be found to be involved in
a patent claim. Economic significance of the product related to
the claim would also suffice to make out an inventive step.
Olaparib definitely possesses economic significance over prior
art. It is sold over 90 countries, used for the treatment of
multiple tumour types, and is a certified blockbuster drug, with
sales revenues of over USD 2.3 billion in 2021. In 2016, the
US FDA had granted “breakthrough therapy” status to Olaparib
for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. The very definition
of a therapy as breakthrough indicated that it possessed
substantial improvement over existing therapy. Mr. Anand
places reliance on literature explaining the concept of a
breakthrough therapy.
(xxxiii) It is only if the suit patent were to lack in inventive
steps, as envisaged by Section 2(1) (ja), that it could be said to
be vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.
Inasmuch as Olaparib could not be said to lack in inventive step
over prior art, the suit patent was not vulnerable to invalidity for
want of obviousness.
(xxxiv) In order to be valid, a claim for patenting an
invention was not required to demonstrate superiority of the
invention over prior art. All that was required to be shown was
that the invention satisfies the test of novelty, non-obviousness
and utility.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 20of69(xxxv) In view of the fact that the genus patent IN’218 did
not contain the teaching to lead a person skilled in the art to
synthesize Olaparib, as the compound claimed in Claim I of the
species patent in IN’720, from the Markush formula claimed in
Claim I of the genus patent, and it was possible to synthesize
Olaparib from the Markush claim in the genus patent only by
cherry-picking the substituents from the several suggested
substitutions in Claim I, and substituting them on the Markush
radicals by employing hindsight reconstruction, it was clear that
the Olaparib could not be said to be disclosed, much less
claimed, in Claim I of the genus patent IN’218.
For all these reasons, among others, Mr. Anand submits that, as the
fact of infringement is indisputable, and as Natco has not succeeded in
setting up a credible challenge to the suit patent, indicating that it is
vulnerable to invalidity, Kudos is entitled to an interlocutory
injunction as sought.
18. Inasmuch as the defendant has, undisputedly, manufactured and
sold generic Olaparib during the life of the suit patent, the fact of
“infringement” of the suit patent by the defendant, as understood
stricto sensu , cannot be disputed either. Mr. Sai Deepak, however,
invokes Section 107, read with clauses (a), (d), (e), (f), (j), (k) and (m)
of Section 64(1) of the Patents Act to defend the charge of
infringement, and the reliefs sought by Kudos on that basis. He also
submits that, for defending an allegation of infringement, andCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 21of69successfully opposing a prayer for interlocutory injunction, a
defendant is only required to put forward a “credible challenge”,
demonstrating the suit patent to be vulnerable to invalidity on one or
the other grounds envisaged by Section 64(1). His submissions,
according to him, meet that standard.
19. To save time and space, I propose to decide this application by
dealing, seriatim, with the various points of defence raised by Mr. Sai
Deepak, vis-à-vis the submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand in that regard.
In doing so, aspects which involve detailed examination of facts and
which, therefore, would merit an exhaustive analysis after both sides
are given an opportunity to lead evidence, are not being addressed,
adhering to the discipline of Astrazeneca-I and Pernod Ricard . I
shall, however, note the said issues towards the conclusion of this
order.
The consideration of credible challenge
20. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that the defendant is only
required to raise a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit
patent in order to succeed in its defence against infringement.
21. There is no dispute about this legal position.
22. However, it is necessary to understand what “credible
challenge” means. In this context, this court has held, in para 19 ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 22of69FMC-II , paras 178 and 231 to 233 of Novartis I and para 129 of
Novartis II thus:
FMC-II
“19.Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity
of the plaintiff's patent need not be such as to demonstrate,
conclusively, the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant
is able to make out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to
revocation under the Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however,
to be demonstrated by way of a credible challenge. The onus would
be on the defendant, therefore, to establish the credibility of the
challenge raised by it. The challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful,
or moonshine. It must not strain the sinews of acceptability. There
can, however, needless to say, be no fixed standard on the basis of
which the credibility of the challenge can be assessed. It would be
for the Court, in each case, therefore, to ascertain, for itself,
whether the challenge raised by the defendant, to the validity of the
suit patent, is, or is not, credible.”
Novartis I
“178 .The challenge in this regard must be credible. Credibility
indicates that, on the face of the challenge, it must merit favourable
consideration. A credible challenge occupies a higher pedestal than
a challenge, which is merely worthy of consideration.
xxxxx
231.Before closing the discussion, I wish to enter a final
observation. There appears, prima facie , to me, to be a fundamental
misconception relating the concepts of a “credible challenge” and
of “vulnerability”. The submissions advanced by the defendant
seem to have been predicated on the premise that the slightest
shadow of doubt, which could be cast on the suit patent, was
sufficient to constitute a credible challenge, exposing its
vulnerability to revocation. This proposition, according to me, is
completely misconceived. Para 28 of the report in Bishwanath
Prasad Radheyshyam recognises the fact that, prior to grant of a
patent, especially for a pharmaceutical product, a thorough study is
normally undertaken by the Patent Office, regarding the validity of
the patent as sought. When an infringer seeks to defend
infringement on the ground that the patent that he infringes is
invalid, the onus, to prove such invalidity heavily lies on him. This
standard has to be met, when applying the principle of
“credibility”. Repeated attempts were made to convince me thatCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 23of69any and every ground that the defendant sought to raise, and for
which a cast iron response from the plaintiff was not immediately
forthcoming, was sufficient to establish vulnerability of the suit
patent to revocation. Revocation is a drastic act, and a patent, once
granted, cannot be treated as easily vulnerable to revocation. Even
if,prima facie , a ground for revocation is made out, as is noted
inMerck v.Glenmark , revocation is not automatic, but remains a
matter of discretion, for the patent authority. The grant of such
discretion is itself a pointer to the legislative intent that, before
revoking a patent, the authority is required to satisfy itself, that, all
considerations having been mould in mind, revocation is absolutely
necessary. Vulnerability to revocation has also to be judged on the
same standard. It is only when, judged on that standard, a credible
challenge to the validity of the patent as vulnerable to revocation is
made out, that an infringer can escape the consequences of
infringement. The standard is, therefore, high, rather than low.
232.This would especially be so in a situation, as in the present
case, the infringer never choose to challenge the suit patent either
at pre-grant or at post-grant stage, by filing oppositions. The
defendants have not, therefore, “cleared the way”, before
exploiting the suit patent. Mr. Sai Deepak sought to contend that,
by deferring the release of their Eltrombopag Olamine, till the
expiry of the term of IN 176, the defendants had sufficiently
cleared the way. Mr. Hemant Singh has disputed this contention,
and I confess that I agree with him. IN 161 was granted as far back
as on 27thMarch, 2009. It has remained in force for 12 years. The
defendants have neither chosen to launch any pre-grant or post-
grant, opposition to IN 161. Nor have they filed any proceedings
before the patent office or the IPAB, to cancel or suspend the
registration granted to IN 161. Rather, even while IN 161 continues
to remain valid, the defendants have, without blinking an eyelid,
sought to exploit the subject matter of the said patent, i.e. EO. That
they have done so with the full awareness that EO is specifically
claimed in IN 161, is not disputed. Clearly, therefore, the
defendants have, by their attitude, as well as by failing to clear the
way before exploiting the suit patent, IN 161, exposed themselves
to an interlocutory injunction.
233.It is only when they have been “caught in the act”, as it
were, that the infringer defendants, unable to dispute the charge of
infringement on facts, seek to question the validity of the suit
patent. While Section 64, undoubtedly, allow them to do so, the
challenge has to be credible, not incredible. The defendants, in the
present case, neither launched any pre-grant nor any post-grant,
opposition to IN 161. They have not initiated any proceedingCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 24of69before IPAB or any other authority, for revocation, cancellation or
removal of the suit patent from the register of patents. In such
circumstances, the holder of the suit patent would ordinarily be
entitled to an injunction against continued infringement. Absent
anyprima facie case of vulnerability of the suit patent to
revocation on the ground of invalidity, therefore, injunction cannot
be refused, once infringement is established.”

“129 .In fact, Natco has, in its submissions, completely glossed
over the most important query which it would have to answer, in
order to set up even a credible challenge to the validity of the suit
patent, vis-à-vis a Markush prior art. The suit patent could be said
to be vulnerable to invalidity, vis-à-vis known Markush prior art,
only if it is established, cumulatively, that
(i) from the known prior art, it is possible to arrive at
the suit patent, by effecting suggested substitutions in the
Markush formula claimed in the prior art, from the
substitutions suggested therein, and
(ii) the Markush prior art contains the requisite teaching,
as would suggest the substitutions which are to be so made
in order to arrive at the suit patent. ”
23. Thus, the onus to establish that the challenge raised by it is
credible, is on the respondent. A credible challenge, as Mr. Pravin
Anand has correctly submitted, is a challenge which is not incredible,
fanciful, or moonshine, and must prima facie be acceptable. On its
face, the challenge must merit favorable consideration. It is not
enough for the defendant to raise a challenge which is worthy of
consideration. The challenge must be more than that; it must partake
of the character of prima facie acceptability. “credibility”, even by
itself, connotes a fairly high standard. In examining whether the
challenge raised is credible, a relevant consideration is the fact that the
Patent Office has, after a thorough study, found the patent to be validCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 25of69and capable of being granted. In Merck , the Division Bench of this
Court held that, even if a ground for revocation of a granted patent
was made out, revocation was not an inevitable sequitur, but that the
patent authority retained discretion in that regard. The same standard
has to be adopted while examining vulnerability to revocation. The
standard of credibility is, therefore, a high standard, not a low
standard, as is commonly understood.
II. The decision in Astrazeneca-I
24. Mr. Sai Deepak laid great stress on the decision in Astrazeneca-
I.According to him, the view taken by this Bench in FMC-II,
Novartis-I and Novartis-II can no longer be followed after the
decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I . As against this, Mr.
Pravin Anand points out that, when the judgment of this Bench in
FMC-II was cited before the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , the
Division Bench did not overrule the decision, but only distinguished it
on the ground that, in FMC-II , only the specie patent was asserted by
the plaintiff whereas, in Astrazeneca-I , both genus and specie patent
were asserted.
25. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that the observation that, in FMC-II ,
the specie patent alone was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I , both
genus and specie patent were asserted, was merely a closing
observation of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , and to accord
that closing observation pre-eminence over all other findings of the
Division Bench would be a lopsided approach. He submits that theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 26of69closing observation regarding the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II
does not dilute the rigour of the rest of the judgment in Astrazeneca-I ,
or take away its precedential value. The findings in the decision, he
submit, apply on all fours to the facts at hand, and are directly
contrary to the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I
andNovartis-II. All those findings cannot, he submit, be overlooked
merely because of the closing observation differentiating the decision
inFMC-II from the facts which were before the Division Bench.
Effect of reference, in Astrazeneca-I , to the decision in FMC-II
26. In so submitting, Mr. Sai Deepak overlooks the fact that, had
the Division Bench felt that the view expressed by this Bench in
FMC-II was wrong, the easiest thing would have to be to overrule it.
Indeed, that would be the only natural course of action which the
Division Bench would ordinarily have followed. The Division Bench
did not, however, do so, and it would, therefore, be overreaching the
decision of the Division Bench if one were to read Astrazeneca-I as
overruling FMC-II. It appears, prima facie , incongruous if an
interpreter of a judgment were, in the process of interpreting, to
rewrite the judgment as doing what the author of the judgment could
have done, but did not choose to do.
27. The Division Bench, therefore, consciously refrained from
overruling the view of this Bench in FMC-II. The words used by the
Division Bench are of stellar significance. The Division Bench
observes:CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 27of69“51. The counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, on 12thJuly, 2021
mentioned the matter, to draw attention to judgment dated 7thJuly,
2021 in applications for interim relief in CS(COMM) No. 69/2021
and CS(COMM) No. 661/2019 titled FMC Corporation v. Best
Crop Science LLP .In taking the view aforesaid, we have
considered the said judgment also, in which infringement of one
patent only was claimed .”
(Emphasis supplied)
28. Nothing, in my considered opinion, could be plainer. The
Division Bench was specifically shown the decision of this Bench in
FMC-II . The Division Bench noted that, in arriving at its view, it had
also considered the decision of this Bench in FMC-II .After
considering the decision of this Bench in FMC-II , the Division Bench
propounded the view that it did, and the identifying and distinguishing
feature of the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II is, clearly, from the
italicised words in para 52 of the report in Astrazeneca-I , the fact that,
inFMC-II , only the specie patent was asserted, whereas, in
Astrazeneca-I , Astrazeneca asserted both the genie and specie patent,
contending that the impugned invention of Intas infringed both
patents . It is because of this distinguishing feature that the Division
Bench in Astrazeneca-I, without disturbing the decision of this Bench
in FMC, held as it did. That much, according to me, is clear from para
52 of Astrazeneca-I.
29. It would, therefore, be folly, according to me, for any
hierarchically subordinate Court, or Bench, to interpret the decision of
the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II , or even
as disapproving the view expressed therein.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 28of69Assuming Mr Sai Deepak’s contention to be correct – Discussion in
main body of the decision in Astrazeneca-I
30. Even if one were to go along with Mr. Sai Deepak’s submission,
and advert to the body of the Astrazeneca-I decision, one finds that
the Division Bench has proceeded almost entirely on the consideration
that Astrazeneca had, in its suit, asserted both the genus and the specie
patents. It is helpful, in this context, to vivisect the Astrazeneca-I
decision into its individual components, as that would help a great
deal in understanding what the Division Bench went on to hold. For
this purpose, the para numbers to which I allude are the para numbers
of the report in the SCC OnLine journal.
31. Astrazeneca, in its suit, asserted two patents; IN 205147 (IN’
147) and IN 235625 (IN’625). On the basis thereof, Astrazeneca
sought an injunction against Intas manufacturing or otherwise dealing
in Dapagliflozin (“DAPA”). The facts of the case are not of much
significance, and are contained in paras 1 to 14 of the report.
32. The Division Bench proceeds, in para 16 of the report, to
enumerate the contentions of learned Counsel for Astrazeneca.
Thereafter, paras 17 to 21, the Division Bench observes thus:
“17. Though ordinarily we would have recorded the arguments
of the counsels for the respondent(s)/defendant(s) also but need
therefor is not felt in the facts of the present case since during the
hearing itself, we entertained doubts/reservations as spelled out
herein below, and which doubts inter alia also form the defence of
the respondent(s)/defendant(s).CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 29of6918. Our doubts stemmed from, the appellants/plaintiffs
averring and pleading manufacture and sale by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA to be in infringement of two
patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. It was felt, that if DAPA was not
disclosed and/or known at the time of seeking patent IN 147 or US
equivalent thereof and was invented only subsequently and patent
thereof obtained in IN 625 or US equivalent thereof, there could be
no infringement by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 by
manufacturing and/or selling DAPA. Conversely, once the
appellants/plaintiffs claimed infringement of IN 147 also, it
necessarily followed that DAPA was subject matter thereof and
once it was the subject matter thereof, how it could be the subject
matter of subsequent patent IN 625 .
19. It was thus enquired from the counsel for the
appellants/plaintiffs, that if the patent IN 147 was/is not of DAPA,
how could the appellants/plaintiffs in the suits from which these
appeals arise, claim infringement by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 also, by manufacturing
DAPA. It was further enquired, whether not from the factum of the
appellants/plaintiffs, in the suits from which these appeals arise,
having claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of
both, IN 147 as well as IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are
deemed to have admitted DAPA as the subject matter of both, IN
147 and IN 625.
20. We, at this stage, spell out the thought process behind the
aforesaid query.
21. In our opinion, with respect to one invention, there can be
only one patent. The appellants/plaintiffs herein however, while
claiming one invention only i.e. DAPA, are claiming two patents
with respect thereto, with infringement of both, by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) .The same alone , in our view, strikes at
the very root of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs and disentitles
the appellants/plaintiffs from any interim relief .”
(Emphasis supplied)
33. Paras 25 to 28, 31, 32, 36, 43 and 45 of the report proceed to
observe thus:
“25. With “invention”, as defined in the statute, forming the
core of a patent and the appellants/plaintiffs in their suits having
claimed only one invention i.e. DAPA, as subject matter of bothCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 30of69the patents, we wondered whether there could be two patents with
respect to the same invention and proceeded to examine the two
patents, to decipher the invention claimed in each.
26. IN 147 sets out the field of invention as under:
“The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which
are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in
the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating
diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X,
diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases,
employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with
one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or
more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents”.
27. IN 625 sets out the field of invention as under:
“The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which
are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in
the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating
diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia,
hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X,
diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases,
employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with
one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or
more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents”.
28. As would immediately be obvious from above, there is
complete identity, without any difference whatsoever, between the
field of invention as set out in the two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN
625. For IN 625 to be with respect to a ‘new product’ involving an
inventive step i.e. a feature involving a technical advance as
compared to existing knowledge including of IN 147 or having
economic significance and which was not anticipated by earlier
publication or use including of IN 147, to say the least, we
expected the description of the field of invention in IN 625 to
describe the technical advancement and/or the difference in
efficacy, from that in IN 147.
*****
31. The Patents Act, though protects the rights and interests of
inventors, but for a limited period, whereafter the monopoly of the
patentee ceases and comes to an end and the invention with respect
to which patent was granted, falls in public domain i.e. open for allCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 31of69to practice and reap benefit of. A patent, vide Section 48 of the
Act, confers a right on the patentee of a product patent, as DAPA
is, to, during the life of the patent, prevent others from making,
using, offering for sale, selling or importing, the new product with
respect whereto patent is granted. The life of a patent is limited,
whereafter, notwithstanding the new product having been invented
by the patentee, patentee no longer has exclusive right to make, use
or offer for sale the same and anyone else interested can also make,
use or offer for sale the said new product invented by the patentee,
without any interference from the patentee. If patents with respect
to the same invention can be granted more than once, successively
in time, the same will negate the legislative intent of limiting the
life of the patent and enable the patentee to prevent others from
making, using or offering for sale, the new product invented by the
patentee, till the time patentee successively keeps on obtaining
patent therefor.
32. As far as the arguments of the counsel for the
appellants/plaintiffs, of DAPA being only covered and not
disclosed in IN 147 and being disclosed for the first time in IN
625, and of DAPA being not obvious from and capable of being
anticipated from IN 147 are concerned, we are also of the opinion
that once the appellants/plaintiffs, in the plaints in their suits
claimed the action of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of
manufacturing medicines having DAPA as their ingredient to be an
infringement of both IN 147 and IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs
are deemed to have admitted DAPA to be the invention subject
matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Without DAPA being disclosed
in IN 147, there could be no patent with respect to DAPA in IN
147 and which was being infringed by the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) by manufacturing drugs/medicines with
DAPA as ingredient.
*****
36. From the aforesaid provisions it follows, that from IN 147
and/or US equivalent thereof, the invention as described therein
could be worked by anyone, save for the exclusivity for the term
thereof in favour of the appellants/plaintiffs. However the claim of
the appellants/plaintiffs is, that DAPA was not disclosed in the
specifications of IN 147 but 80 other compounds were disclosed.
However if that were to be the case, it being not the case of the
appellants/plaintiffs that the respondent(s)/defendant(s) were
manufacturing any of the said 80 compounds, the
appellants/plaintiffs, for manufacture by
respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA, cannot claim infringement of
IN 147 and could have claimed infringement only of IN 625 in
which DAPA was disclosed.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 32of69*****
43. However, under the Indian regime, patent is to be sought
and granted with respect to a new product or process. “Product” is
not defined in the Act. The said word is thus deemed to have been
used in the Act, as commonly understood. “Product” is understood
as something that is made to be sold, usually something that is
produced by an industrial process or, less commonly, something
that is grown or obtained through farming. However, the
arguments of the appellants/plaintiffs before us make out IN 147 to
be a discovery/invention of a group of formulations, which was
capable, with further research, of acting as a drug/medicine for
inhibiting re-absorption of sugar in kidneys. The
appellants/plaintiffs, on the basis thereof could not have
manufactured any drug/medicine and have not pleaded any
drug/medicine manufactured post IN 147 and thus it prima
facie appears, could not have restrained any other person who
discovered DAPA, even if from IN 147. In fact we wondered, why
the appellants/plaintiffs have pleaded and claimed infringement by
the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Though
in response to our query aforesaid, we expected the
appellants/plaintiffs to confine their claim for infringement to IN
625 only but the appellants/plaintiffs stuck to their stand of the
respondent(s)/defendant(s) being also in infringement of IN 147. It
is obvious therefrom that the appellants/plaintiffs have no legs to
stand on, by claiming infringement of IN 625 only, without also
claiming infringement of IN 147. However, as held in the
impugned judgment/order dated 2ndNovember, 2020, the question
of the respondent(s)/defendant(s), by working DAPA, infringing
IN 147 could arise only if DAPA was disclosed in IN 147. If
DAPA was disclosed in IN 147, even if better disclosed in IN 625,
cannot enjoy two rounds of 20 years of protection, when the
legislative policy is to grant protection for a period of one term of
20 years only.
*****
45. We, at least at this stage are unable to, in the face of the
aforesaid pleadings of the appellants/plaintiffs themselves, find any
difference between IN 147 and IN 625. The appellants/plaintiffs
themselves are found to be pleading DAPA to have been disclosed
generally in IN 147 and specifically in IN 625. In the face of the
said pleading, no case for injuncting the respondent(s)/defendant(s)
during the pendency of the suits is made out. As aforesaid, we
entertain doubt as to the very basis of the claim of the
appellants/plaintiffs, as noted in the judgment/order dated
2ndNovember, 2020 identifying the key question in the dispute toCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 33of69be “whether the compound-in-issue i.e. Dapagliflozin [in short
“DAPA”] which, according to the plaintiffs, is covered in IN 147
stands disclosed both, in law as well as on facts”.
34. In the face of the afore-extracted passages, it would be facile to
even suggest that the simultaneous assertion, by Astrazeneca, of the
genus patent IN’147 and the species patent IN’625, resulting in the
allegation that the manufacture and sale, by Intas, of dapagliflozin
infringed both the genus and the species patents, did not play a
predominant role in the Division Bench holding as it did. In para 18,
the Division Bench holds that, by simultaneously claiming
infringement of the genus and the species patent, Astrazeneca had
admitted that DAPA was the subject matter of both patents. In para 21,
it is observed, even more significantly, that Astrazeneca was “ claiming
two patents ...with infringement of both ”. This act of Astrazeneca in
claiming both the genus and the species patent through DAPA, and
alleging infringement of both patents by Intas, was found by the
Division Bench to strike at the very root of the claim of Astrazeneca,
disentitling it to any interim relief. The simultaneous assertion by
Astrazeneca of the genus and the species patent, and the consequent
allegation that the manufacturer of DAPA by Intas had infringed both
patents, was found by the Division Bench, in para 32 of the report, to
amount to a deemed admission, by Astrazeneca, that DAPA was the
“invention subject matter” of both the genus and the species patents.
By thus claiming the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas as
infringing the genus and the species patents, the Division Bench
observed that Astrazeneca had impliedly acknowledged the disclosure
of DAPA in the complete specifications both of the genus and theCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 34of69species patent. Thus, the act of Astrazeneca, in alleging the
manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing the genus as
well as the species patent, was found to foreclose Astrazeneca from
maintaining any stand that the genus patent did not disclose DAPA.
35. This position is even more prominently underscored in para 36
of the report, in which the Division Bench holds that if the case of
Astrazeneca were that DAPA was not disclosed in the genus patent,
though 80 other compounds were disclosed, DAPA could not have
blamed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas, to be infringing
the genus patent IN’147. Para 39 of the report again emphasizes the
view of the Division Bench, that, if the genus patent IN’147 did not
disclose DAPA, AstraZeneca could not have claimed the manufacture
and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing IN’147. The concluding
observation in para 39 specifically holds that the act of Astrazeneca in
pleading infringement of the genus patent IN’147 as well as the
species patent IN’625 had, at least at the interlocutory stage, to be
treated as an admission, by Astrazeneca, of DAPA being a known
substance, while obtaining the genus patent.
36. Para 43 of the report gives voice to the concern, of the Division
Bench, as to why Astrazeneca had pleaded and claimed infringement,
by Intas, of both the genus and the species patents. Significantly, the
paragraph goes on to observe that, when the Division Bench had
queried Astrazeneca in that regard, it was expected that Astrazeneca
would confine their claim of infringement only to the species patent –
which is what Kudos has done in the present case . The obviousCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 35of69sequitur is that, had Astrazeneca restricted its claim of infringement to
the species patent, instead of alleging infringement of the genus and
species patent both, the outcome of the judgment would have been
different. The submission of Mr. Sai Deepak that the ultimate
decision in Astrazeneca-I would not be different even if Astrazeneca
had asserted only the species patent, instead of asserting genus and
species patents both, is, therefore, clearly unsustainable, in the light of
the observations in para 43 of Astrazeneca-I .
37. The insistence, by Astrazeneca, to continue to plead
infringement by Intas, of the genus patent IN’147 as well as the
species patent IN’625 was found to be defeating the case that
Astrazeneca was seeking to set up.
38. Practically, the entire reasoning of the Division Bench of this
Court in Astrazeneca-I , therefore, revolves around the fact that
Astrazeneca was pleading infringement, by DAPA, of the genus patent
IN’147 as well as the species patent IN’625. This assertion of
simultaneous infringement of both the genus and the species patents
was found to completely defeat the case of Astrazeneca. Perhaps,
most significantly, in para 43, the Division Bench observed that
Astrazeneca might have had a case, had it restricted its claim of
infringement to the species patent, rather than claiming infringement
of both the genus and the species patents.
39. In the present case, there is no dispute that Kudos has claimed
infringement only of the species patent IN’720 and has claimed noCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 36of69infringement of the genus patent IN’218. The above observations of
the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I , particularly in conjunction with
the manner in which the Division Bench sought to distinguish the
judgment of this court in FMC-II , clearly indicates that, in a case
where the species patent alone is asserted, and no infringement of the
genus patent is pleaded, the decision in FMC-II would continue to
hold the field.
40. In fact, far from Astrazeneca-I overruling FMC-II, orFMC-II
being no longer good law after the decision in Astrazeneca-I , my
understanding is that, in a case where a species patent alone is
asserted, Astrazeneca-I upholds the decision in FMC-II as
representing the correct legal position. The decision in Astrazeneca-I
having been upheld by the Supreme Court by dismissal of the SLP , in a
case where the species patent alone is asserted, the correct legal
position would be the position taken by this Court in FMC-II .
III. Individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak
41. The individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak
in the present case are all covered by the earlier decisions of this
bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I andNovartis-II . Though appeals may
have been preferred against these decisions, I have not been informed
of any interlocutory order having been passed, staying their operation.
42. I deem it necessary, therefore, only to allude to the relevant
passages from the decisions of this bench in FMC-II ,Novartis-I andCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 37of69Novartis-II , which address the issues raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-
visthe facts which arise in the present case, rather than re-analyze the
legal position ab initio .
IV . The coverage v. disclosure conundrum and the challenge on the
ground of obviousness and lack of inventive step – Section 64(1)(f)
43. The aspect of whether coverage and disclosure are the same, or
whether coverage implies disclosure, has to be decided on the basis of
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Novartis AG , as the Supreme
Court has specifically alluded to the point. Howsoever one may
interpret or understand Novartis AG , it is not permissible for any
court, lower in the judicial hierarchy to the Supreme Court, to allow
its judicial peregrinations to take it outside Novartis AG of that
decision, when dealing with the aspect of coverage vis-à-vis
disclosure.
44. InFMC-II , this Court has analyzed the decision in Novartis AG
threadbare, para by para. The conclusion that this Court has arrived is
contained in paras 81 to 84 of the decision, which may be reproduced
thus:
“81.Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis have, in
my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, which
set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, by
learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina.
Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they
necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual
controversy before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced
were general in nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as
contained in paras 118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally
omnibus. What was contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as
recorded in paras 114 and 116 of the report, was that “the scope ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 38of69coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a patent”. This
argument stands reiterated, in the same para (para 116) - “that
coverage that is granted in respect of a patent is not always co-
extensive with what is disclosed in the patent”. In the light of the
Zimmerman invention, learned Senior Counsel contended that “the
patent may be entitled to larger coverage than what is specifically
disclosed in it”. The teaching in the patent, it was contended, lay
“in the disclosure/specification that supports the claim”, which
“describes the invention”. Dealing with these submissions, the
Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that “the
dichotomy… sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on the
one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on
the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale
of the law of patent”. The words “in apatent”, as used by the
Supreme Court, indicated of the intent of the Supreme Court to be
expounding the law in general terms, and not limited to the
Zimmerman patent, or the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare
reading of para 118 of the report in Novartis AG makes it clear that
the Supreme Court has expressed its view with respect to patents in
general. The opening sentence of para 119 of the report is a
proposition couched in absolute terms and, in my respectful
opinion, it would be folly, on the part of this Court, to restrict those
observations to the facts of Novartis AG .
82. According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of
repetition), any dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage
or claim, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent,
struck at the very root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the
Supreme Court has disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any
dichotomy being sought to be drawn between coverage and
disclosure.
83. Having said that, etymologically, “dichotomy” is not the
same as “distinction”. The Supreme Court has not held that
coverage and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is
no distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its
words with precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no
“dichotomy” between “coverage” and disclosure”. “Dichotomy” is
defined, in the Oxford Dictionary, as “a division or contrast
between two things that are or are being represented as being
opposed or entirely different ”. In holding that there can be no
dichotomy between coverage or claim, on the one hand, and
disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the other, the Supreme
Court has not, therefore, held that they are identical. Accepting the
submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require this Court to place, in
the first sentence in para 119 of the report in Novartis AG , the
word “dichotomy” with “distinction” or “difference”. That, I amCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 39of69afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court has, in
disapproving the existence of any “wide gap” between coverage
and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any
dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold
that the concepts were identical.
84. Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus,
would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act,
which make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to
“disclosure”. Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not
envisage the “claim” or “coverage” of the claim, to be identical to
“disclosure”. Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held.
What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court,
by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in
the Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore,
covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not
disclosed by it. Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to
holding that there was complete dichotomy between “coverage”
and “disclosure”, with no connection between the two. It would
amount to holding that, while examining what was disclosed in a
patent, the authority, or the Court concerned, was to remain
oblivious to the coverage of the patent. Such a dichotomy, which
would result in a “wide gap” between coverage and disclosure was,
in terms, disapproved by the Supreme Court. If, however, there
was clear coverage of a product in the claim (as was found to exist
in the Zimmerman Patent, qua Imatinib Mesylate), it would be
difficult for the patent holder to assert, before the Court, that,
despite such coverage, the claim did not disclose the product. That,
in my view, is what Novartis AG holds. It does not pronounce that
coverage and disclosure are identical or synonymous terms, in
patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai Deepak, to that effect
cannot, therefore, be accepted.”
45. It cannot, therefore, be said that coverage is the same as
disclosure or that, by accepting coverage of the impugned product by
the genus patent, the plaintiff also admits disclosure.
46. A bare glance at the Markush structure claimed in Claim I of
the genus patent IN’218, vis-à-vis the chemical structure of Olaparib
as claimed in Claim I of the species patent IN’720, makes it apparentCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 40of69that Olaparib cannot be said to have been disclosed in the genus
patent.
47. Natco’s pleadings in this regard are admittedly to be found in
paras 89 to 106 of the written statement filed by way of response to
the present plaint, which read thus:
“89. The following submissions are made without prejudice to
the foregoing averments as well as subsequently following
submissions under other grounds of revocation.
90. It is submitted that the claims of IN’720 lack inventive step
and/or are obvious in view of the following prior art, when taken
independently or in any combination:
Teachings of WO’576
91. WO’576 discloses the preparation of specific product
claimed in IN’720. The specific portions of the complete
specification of WO’576 specifically teaches and also categorically
suggests the the specific substitutions in the Markush structure of
WO’576 which result in Olaparib claimed in IN’720. For the
purpose of convenience, the specific portions of the complete
specification of WO’576 are reproduced below:
WO’576 discloses the following compound
wherein
A-B, R Nand RC can be optionally substituted.
Substitution of A-B
Page 5 of the complete specification states the second aspect of the
present invention whereinCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 41of69A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused
aromatic ring
At Page 7 of the complete specification describes aromatic ring as
follows:
The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein in the conventional sense
to refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure
having delocalised n-electron orbitals.
Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:
In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group
comprises a single aromatic ring , which has five or six ring atoms ,
which ring atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulphur , and which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of
these groups include benzene , pyrazine, pyrrole, thiazole,
isoxazole, and oxazole .
Substitution of RC
RCis -CH 2-RL;
Substitution of RL
RLis optionally substituted phenyl
At Page 19 of the description:
RLis preferably a benzene ring , naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3-
benzodioxole , and more preferably a benzene ring
When RLis a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted . The one or
more substituents may be selected from: C 1-7alkyl, more preferably
methyl, CF 3; C 5-20aryl; C 3-20heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably
fluoro ; hydroxy; ether , more preferably methoxy, phenoxy,
benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano ; carbonyl groups , such
as carboxy ester and amido ; amino (including sulfonamide), more
preferably -NH 2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as
morpholino; acylamido including ureido groups, where the acyl or
amino substituent is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally
fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.
On page 15 of the complete specification preferred substituents of
the benzene ring when RLis phenyl is given and includes:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -CCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 42of69(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1and R2are independently amino
substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido
groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH 2, -C(=0)NHCH 3,
-C(=0)N(CH 3)2, - C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and -C(=0)N(CH 2CH 3)2, as
well as amido groups in which R1and R2, together with the
nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic
structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl,
morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and
piperazinocarbonyl.
Substitution of RN
92. The specific disclosures in WO’576 regarding these
particular substitutions provides the teaching, suggestion and
motivation and also makes it obvious for a person skilled in the art
to reach to the desired product i.e., Olaparib claimed in IN’720 .
93. It is pertinent that there is nothing in IN’720 which would
show any technical advancement or economic significance over the
disclosure of WO’576 – given the substantial identity of the
respective disclosures (as outlined above under prior publication
and relied on for purposes of brevity as if reproduced herein).
94. Given that the dosages, the modes of formulation and even
the concentration of active in formulation are identical, IN’720 is
woefully lacking in any material which would show the purported
inventive step of the claims that were granted. It is in fact equally
pertinent that Olaparib, i.e.,Compound 168 of IN’720 actually
lacks supporting disclosure to show that it has the same benefits of
IC50 values or potentiating growth factor values as the remaining
compounds of that document, let alone better values than the
compounds disclosed in WO’576. Simply put, IN’720 lacks any
seed material to support the claim of inventive step over WO’576.
95. It is therefore submitted that IN’720 must be rejected alone
on the ground of lack of inventive step and/or obviousness based
on WO’576 alone.
Teachings of WO 2002/014090
96. Yet another prior art on the basis of which IN’720 lacks
inventive step is WO’090. The details of WO’090 are as follows:

97. The application was published on 20.02.2003 i.e., before
the earliest priority dated of IN’720 and hence, is prior art for
IN’720.
98. The cited prior art relates to the amino phthalazinone
derivatives active as Kinase inhibitors. Page 4 Placitum 16 of
WO’090 states:
The present invention provides a method for treating
diseases caused by and/or associated with an altered
protein kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in
need thereof an effective amount of an amino-
phthalazinone derivative represented by formula (I):
wherein the relevant teaching is as follows:
Ra and Rb are, each independently, a hydrogen atom or a
group,
R2 is a hydrogen atom or it is a group, optionally further
substituted m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3;
R1is hydrogen or an optionally substituted group selected
from
alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl ,
heterocyclyl or
heterocyclylalkylCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 44of69Page 31 placitum 35 defines arylalkyl group as:
arylalkyl group such as, for instance , the benzyl group , by
working
according to conventional methods .
Page 10 placitum 4 further describes the substitution of
benzyl group as:
optionally substituted in any of the free positions by one
or more groups , for instance 1 to 6 groups, selected from:
halogen , nitro, oxo groups (=0) , carboxy, cyano, alkyl,
perfluorinated alkyl, alkenyl alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,
heterocyclyl, a ino groups and derivatives thereof such as,
for instance, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino,
diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido;
carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for
instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino ,
alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino,
alkoxycarbonylamino.
99. The above disclosure of WO’090 not only teaches but
also suggests the specific substitutions described above. For
a person of skill in the art, this also provides the motivation
to try and practice the substitutions taught and suggested in
WO’090 since the cited document also relates to providing
anti-tumour compounds. The difference if any resides in
that WO’090 suggests and additional substitution of an
amino on the benzene ring. There is however, nothing to
suggest that the unsubstituted phthalazinone would be
ineffective or is not preferred. In any event, even this
differential is overcome when WO’090 and WO’576 are
read together – which would provide a phthalazinone
derivative without the additional amino substitution on the
benzene ring. There is sufficient motivation to read the two
documents together since both in essence relate to
phthalazinone derivatives and both purportedly provide
compounds with anti-tumoral activity. When the teaching
of WO’090 is read together with the teachings of WO’576,
there is sufficient, teaching, suggestion and motivation
which renders the claims of IN’720 and in particular
Olaparib obvious for a person of skill in the art. On the
above-mentioned ground, IN’720 lacks inventive step and
is obvious to a person of skill in the art.
Teachings of EP 0289881CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 45of69100. EP’881 relates to 2-aminoalkyl-4-benzyl-1-(2H)-
phthalazinone derivatives and was published on
09.11.1988. It is therefore prior art for IN’720. EP’881
describes compounds which are useful as antiasthmatic,
antiallergic, Paf-antagonistic (Paf = platelet activating
factor, mediator, which triggers asthma inter alia) and
leukotriene-inhibition. The EPO machine-translated copy of
EP’881 is filed in the proceedings.
Page 1 of EP’881 states:
""….a process for preparing basic substituted phthalazinone
of the general formula
in which R1represents an aryl or aralkyl radical optionally
substituted in the nucleus, R2 represents a divalent straight
or branched aliphatic chain having at least 2 and at most 5
carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 denote low molecular weight
alkyl groups which, together with the nitrogen, may be
members of a heterocyclic ring, or their salts or quaternary
ammonium compounds. For these compounds, a
histaminolytic (antihistamine) effect, spasmolytic and local
anaesthetic effect is specified.
The radical R1 is preferably in the 4-position of the phenyl
ring; occurring C1-C6-alkyl groups , C1-C6-alkoxy groups,
alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups can be straight or
branched, in particular these radicals consist of 1-4 or, if
they are unsaturated, of 3-4 C atoms.
If R3 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group, there is at least one
saturated C atom between the unsaturated bond and the
nitrogen. The unsaturated bond is preferably in the 2,3-
position or 3,4-position.
The C3-C8-cycloalkyl radical is in particular the
cyclopentyl radical or cyclohexyl radical.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 46of69If R3 represents a phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical, this may be
mono -,di-or trisubstituted by the stated radicals. The alkyl
part of this phenylalkyl radical preferably consists of one,
two or three C atoms and may optionally also be branched.
The alkylene bridge Alk can be straight or branched and
preferably consists of two, three or four C atoms. If this
alkylene bridge contains Alk a double bond, it is isolated
from the group NR2 R3 if R2 is hydrogen (ie, not
conjugated to this group). Preferably, at least one saturated
carbon atom is located between such a double bond and the
two nitrogen bonds.
Particularly favourable effects have, for example, those
compounds where the radicals R1 to R3, Alk have the
following meanings: R1 = fluorine, chlorine or bromine, in
particular in the 4-position, preferably fluorine in the 4-
position; R2 = C1-C6-alkyl, preferably methyl; R3 =
phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl, optionally substituted as indicated.
The substituents of the phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical are
preferably C1-C4-alkyl groups (in particular methyl) or a
halogen (for example Cl, F) or C1-C4-alkoxy groups (in
particular methoxy groups). The substituents in the phenyl
part of this phenylalkyl radical are preferably in the 2-
position, 3-position, 4-position or 2,4-position. Occurring
alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkanoylamino or alkoxy alkyl
groups may be straight or branched.Alkyl or alkoxy
radicals preferably consist of 1 to 4 C atoms, the alkanoyl
radicals preferably consist of 2 to 4 C atoms.
101. The teachings of EP’881 suggest similar structure of
phthalazinone derivatives and also suggests towards the
substitution of phenyl at R1 which is further substituted
with a halo group (one of which is F) as preferred. Hence, if
such teachings of EP’881 are read with the teachings of
WO’576 and/or WO’090, it clearly suggests and teaches
towards what is claimed as an “invention” IN’720, thus
rendering claims 1 and 2 of IN’720 obvious for a person of
skill in the art. Hence, on the basis of the teachings of
EP’881 read with above cited arts, IN’720 is obvious and
lacks inventive step.
Teachings of WO 2002/090334
102. Another prior art on the basis of which IN’720 lacksCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 47of69inventive step is WO’334. The present Patent has also been
filed by the same entity i.e., Kudos Pharmaceuticals and
even has at least two common inventors.
103. It is respectfully submitted that, on the basis of
specific disclosure in WO’334, IN’720 lacks inventive step.
For the perusal of this Hon’ble court, the specific teachings
of WO’334 which results in the final product claimed in
IN’720 is reproduced herein:
The complete specification at page no. 5 reproduces the
following compound
wherein:
A-B together represent an optionally substituted aromatic
ring One of the RC 1and RC 2is -CH 2-RLand other of RC1
and RC 2is H R Lis optionally substituted Phenyl; and
RNis hydrogen
On page 17 placitum 20 onwards, Further preferences of
substitution is discussed as:
It is preferred that only one of RC1 And RC2 is represented
by -L-R L, and the other of RC1 and R C2is H
On Page 17 Placitum 25
The fused aromatic ring(s) represented by -A-B- preferably
consist of solely carbon ring and thus may be Benzene,
naphthalene and is more preferably Benzene.
On page 17 placitum 31
RN is preferably selected from hydrogen.
On Page 18 placitum 28
RLis preferably C 5-20aryl, and more preferably a benzene
ring, naphthalene, pyridine, 1,3-benzodioxole or furan.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 48of69When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The
one or more substituents may be selected from: C 1-7alkyl,
more preferably methyl, CF 3; C 5-20aryl, C 3-20heterocyclyl;
halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more
preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy;
nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and
amido; amino (including sulphonamide), more preferably -
NH 2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino;
acylamido, including ureido groups, where the acyl or
amino substituents is preferably phenyl, which itself is
optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether;
sulphoxide; sulphone
On Page 14 placitum 8 amido group is explained as:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl,
carboxamide) : -C (=0)NR 1R2, wherein R1and R2are
independently amino substituents, as defined for amino
groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not
limited to, -C(=0)NH 2, -C(=0)NHCH 3, -C(=0)N(CH 3)2, -
C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and -C (=0)N (CH 2CH 3)2, as well as
amido groups in which R1and R2, together with the
nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a
heterocyclic structure as in, for example,
piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl,
thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .
104. It is respectfully submitted that the only difference
that WO’334 shows is the specific substitution of Nitrogen
(N) at RC2. If the teachings of WO’334 are read together
with WO’576, it makes it obvious for the person skilled in
the art to reach Olaparib now claimed in IN’720.
105. It is further submitted that such specific disclosure
regarding the substitutions and the fact that the application
has been filed by the same applicant and have at least 2
common inventors clearly shows that the product claimed
in IN’720 was always within the knowledge of Plaintiff 1
and that the filing IN’720 was an attempt at protecting an
import monopoly and evergreening of patent protection for
Olaparib.
106. On the basis of above disclosures in the above cited
prior arts read alone or in combination, it is respectfully
submitted that IN’720 lacks inventive step and/or is
obvious.”CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 49of6948. A bare reading of the afore-extracted paragraphs from the
written statement of Natco indicates that Natco is arriving at chemical
structure of Olaparib, in the case of each of the referred prior art
inventions, by choosing select radicals out of the several suggested
substitutions in the complete specifications of the prior art patents.
There is not a whisper of an averment, in the written statement, to
justify such preferential selection. By way of example, when Natco
picks the amido radical out of a choice of “carbonyl groups, such as
carboxy, ester and amido”, or carbylamino and its alkylcarbylamino
derivative out of a choice of “alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino,
diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups
and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino,
alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino,
alkoxycarbonylamino ”,the written statement does not indicate why
Natco chooses to make that particular choice . Nor does it contain
anything to indicate that the teachings in the suggested prior arts
would lead a person skilled in the art to make that particular
selection . The exercise undertaken by Natco is, therefore, clearly an
exercise of hindsight reconstruction, armed with prior knowledge of
the necessary radicals which are to be substituted onto the Markush
Claim I of the genus patent IN’218 in order to arrive at claim I of the
species patent IN’720, by cherry-picking the appropriate radicals for
substitution. Such hindsight operation, prima facie , demolishes the
plea, of Natco that Claim I in the suit patent is obvious from the genus
patent, or, for that reason, that the species patent is vulnerable to
invalidity on the ground of want of inventive step, under Section
64(1)(f) of the Patents Act.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 50of6949. Indeed, if Olaparib were so obvious from the suggested prior
arts, there is no explanation why it took 19 years, after the genus
patent had been granted, for Natco to synthesize Olaparib. Even as an
old patent, which has weathered 19 years of uninfringed existence,
therefore, the suit patent is entitled to protection.
V . Re. allegation of anticipation by prior claiming – Section
64(1)(a)
48. Section 64(1)(a) has also come up for analyses by this Court in
FMC-II , and paras 107 and 109 to 112 of the said decision may in this
context be thus reproduced:
“107.Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent
already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of
the said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in
the complete specification of another patent granted in India. The
statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for
alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention
claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was
claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier
priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the
complete specification of another patent granted in India (for ease
of reference, “the prior patent”). A defendant who seeks to allege
invalidity, or vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a),
therefore, predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent
was valid. An allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to
any challenge to the validity of the suit patent under Section
64(1)(a). The defendant in the present case, in asserting
vulnerability of IN’307 as having been anticipated by prior
claiming in Claim 22 of IN’978, therefore, has to accede to the
validity of Claim 22 of IN’978.
*****
109.CTPR is the “invention… claimed in Claim 1 of the
complete specification” in IN’307, i.e. the suit patent. The “validCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 51of69claim of earlier priority date” in the prior patent, for the purposes
of Section 64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of
IN’978. Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent
vulnerable if CTPR is, prima facie , claimed in Claim 22 of IN’978.
110.I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is notclaimed,
or even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN’978. Claim 22 of IN’978
claims a Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said
Markush moiety to Claim 1 in IN’307, or to CTPR, only by cherry
picking select radicals out of the innumerable choices provided in
the complete specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN’978, for
substitution on said Markush moiety. Save and except for
demonstrating how, by substituting such select radicals, it is
possible to move from the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN’978
to Claim 1 of IN’307, or to CTPR, the defendant has, in its written
statement, not indicated any teaching or guidance, available in the
complete specifications of IN’278, as would guide a person skilled
in the art to pick the select radicals and substitute them on the
Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN’978, so as to “lead” him to
CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the Markush formula claimed in Claim
1 of IN’307, is obvious from the disclosure provided in Claim 22
of IN’978.
111.The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as
is apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written
submissions filed by the defendant that “Claim 22 of IN’978
encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of
the impugned patent IN’307, thereby rendering the entirety of the
principal claim of IN 307 vulnerable to revocation”. The
correctness of this argument of the defendant appears to be
somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears to be contrary to the
contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words used in Section
13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While advancing this
contention, the defendant has introduced two new concepts, which
find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of “scope” and
“coverage”. Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a claim in the
suit patent “is claimed in any claim of any other complete
specification”. It does not make any reference either to the scope of
the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required
therefore, prima facie , is comparison of the claims, not whether the
claim in the suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the
claim in the genus patent. This position is also conceded by the
defendant, in its written submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily,
a challenge of anticipation by prior claiming has to be decided on a
claim-to-claim comparison. The defendant would seek to contend
that, in the present case, this exercise is obviated because of the
admission - as the defendant would perceive it - by the plaintiff, inCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 52of69its plaint and replication, of the coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of
IN’978. No such admission is, as already held here in before,
discernible from the paragraphs on which the defendant seeks to
place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, even as per the
defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine the
applicability of Section 64(1)(a) - or, for that matter, Section
13(1)(b) - to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when
undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these
provisions apply.
112.The defendant has made a strained effort to justify
invocation of Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if
Claim 1 in IN’307 includes variants which were outside the scope
of Claim 22 in IN’978, the former claim was, nonetheless,
rendered prima facie vulnerable to the extent it fell within the
scope of Claim 22 of IN’978, i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR.
Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor Section 64(1)(a), in my considered
opinion, lends itself to such an interpretation. All that these
provisions require the Court - or authority before whom the
challenge to the validity is raised - to do is to assess whether the
invention, insofar as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or
was not, claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is
notclaimed in Claim 22 of IN’978. The highest that the defendant
can assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an
arthropodicidal anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush
coverage of Claim 22 of IN’978. In the discussion here in before, I
have already opined that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot
be that CTPR has been claimed in Claim 22 of IN’978.”
49. As has been correctly contended by Mr. Pravin Anand, a plea of
vulnerability of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior
claiming can successfully be raised only if the claim in the suit patent
has been claimed in a patent of an earlier priority date. There must,
therefore, be identity of claims . Para 16 of the written submissions
filed by Mr. Sai Deepak, it is asserted, in this regard, thus:
“16. From the above it is clear that anticipation by prior claiming
u/Sec. 64(1)(a) is dependent on reasonable construction of the
claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product but
is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the
complete specification. After all, what the patentee can assert
against third parties in the form of a sword must be equally
available to the third parties as a shield to defend themselvesCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 53of69against the patentee’s claim of infringement. Any other
interpretation of the statutory scheme would defeat the manifest
legislative intent and that too in a critical realm such as the
pharmaceutical industry. The concept of enabling disclosure may at
best be applicable with respect to the ground of anticipation by
prior publication, but not in the context of anticipation by prior
claiming since Sec. 64(1)(a) is meant to act as a fetter on the
patentee’s ability to evergreen its right to sue based on the claim
and is therefore not contingent on the scope or specificity of the
disclosure. Therefore, to apply the test of enabling disclosure in the
context of 64(1)(a) is to foist on it one of the possible standards
which may be applicable to Sec. 64(1)(e).”
50. The assertions in the afore-extracted passage from the written
submissions of Mr. Sai Deepak, in my view, is based on a
fundamentally erroneous legal premise.
51. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that a claim of vulnerability of
the suit patent to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior
claiming “is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to
assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product, but is in no
way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the complete
specification”. It is further sought to be contended that specificity of
disclosure may be a relevant test for Section 64(1)(e), but cannot be
regarded as a relevant test for Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act.
52. The view expressed by me in FMC-II , as already extracted
hereinabove, compels me to disagree with Mr. Sai Deepak’s
submissions. In my view, Section 64(1)(a) is clear and categorical in
the words it uses. It states that the invention, so far as claimed in the
suit patent, has to have been claimed in a valid claim of earlier
priority date for the suit patent to be regarded as vulnerable toCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 54of69invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming. There has,
therefore, to be identity of claims. The claim asserted in the suit
patent, must have been claimed in a complete specification relating to
a patent of earlier priority date. Then, and only then, can a plea of
invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming be
successfully laid.
53. A claim is even more specific than a disclosure. On a plain
claim to claim comparison, it is clear that Olaparib, as Claim I in the
suit patent IN’720, has never been claimed in any earlier patent to
which Mr. Sai Deepak draws attention. The Markush structure
claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN’218 certainly cannot be said
to claim Claim I in the suit patent IN’720. As such, no prima facie
case of anticipation by prior claiming can be said to exist.
Reliance on Form 27s, PTE applications by Kudos in Australia and
Korea and Eurasian patent EU 006300 and Russian patent RU
2755865
54. Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to place reliance on the Forms 27
filed by Kudos in respect of IN’720 and IN’218, the PTE applications
filed by Kudos in Australia and Korea and the identity of the Eurasian
and Russian equivalents of alleged identity of the claims in Russian
patent RU’865 with the claims in IN’720.
55. I do not see how this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC, can delve into such depth of
detail. It is true, this Court has, in earlier decisions, done so.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 55of69However, in view of the note of caution sounded by the Supreme
Court in Pernod Ricard , I am of the opinion that some kind of rethink
is necessary on this aspect. There is no denying the fact that orders on
applications filed in pharma patent cases for interim relief often go
into such depth of details that practically nothing remains for
adjudication in the suit. This may not be an acceptable way of
proceeding.
56. Particularly when dealing with a challenge to the validity of the
suit patent on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, once the
Court finds, on facts, by claim to claim comparison, that there is no
anticipation by prior claiming, statements made in other jurisdictions,
or in documents filed by the plaintiffs elsewhere, cannot make out a
case of anticipation by prior claiming, even at the prima facie stage.
ought not to legitimately form part of the consideration. The plaintiffs
would have, during the course of trial, every opportunity to explain
the circumstances in which such statements were made, and before
grant of such opportunity, where a prima facie clear case of lack of
anticipation of prior claiming is made out, the matter must rest there,
when dealing with an Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications.
57. I have nonetheless reproduced, in this regard, the defence raised
by Mr. Anand to the various points raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, and for
the purposes of adjudicating the present Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2
applications, suffice it to state that the challenges have not been left
unanswered. The response by Mr. Praveen Anand raises, at the very
least, triable issues. When, on a claim to claim comparison, no case ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 56of69anticipation of prior claiming is found to exist, it cannot be said that
the defendant has raised a credible challenge on that ground.
VI. Re. Anticipation by prior publication – Section 64(1)(e)
58. Anticipation by prior publication has also been dealt with, by
this Bench, in its decisions in FMC-II andNovartis I . Paras 117 to
118, 124 to 128 and 133 of FMC-II and para 222 of Novartis I may,
in this context, be reproduced thus:
From FMC-II
“117 .Section 64(1)(e) states where the invention, so far as
claimed in the suit patent, is not new, having regard to either (i)
what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the
priority date of the claim in the suit patent or (ii) what was
published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to
in Section 13. Unlike Section 64(1)(a), therefore, which is a self-
contained provision, Section 64(1)(e) refers us back to Section 13.
Sub-sections (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13 are relevant, and maybe
reproduced thus:
“13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and
by prior claim -
(1) The examiner to whom an application for a patent is
referred under section 12 shall make investigation for the
purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as
claimed in any claim of the complete specification -
(a) has been anticipated by publication before the date
of filing of the applicant's complete specification in any
specification filed in pursuance of an application for a
patent made in India and dated on or after the 1stday of
January, 1912;
*****
(2) The examiner shall, in addition, make investigation
for the purpose of ascertaining, whether the invention, so
far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification,
has been anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere in
any document other than those mentioned in subsection (1)CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 57of69before the date of filing of the applicant's complete
specification.”
118.Whether under clause (1)(a) or (2), what Section 13
requires is publication of the invention, claimed in the suit patent,
in any document, before the date of filing of the complete
specification in the suit patent.
xxxxx
124.Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words “that the invention so
far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not
new”. This necessarily refers us back to the definition of “new
invention” in clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning “any invention or
technology which has not been anticipated by publication in any
document or used in the country or elsewhere in the world before
the date of filing of patent application with complete specification,
i.e., the subject matter has not fallen in public domain or that it
does not form part of the state of the art”. “Anticipation”, when
used in the Patents Act, has its own peculiar legal connotation.
Though “anticipation”, per se , is not separately defined, Section 13
provides for anticipation only by prior publication or by prior
claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability of a patent to
revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior publication. In
order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute the basis for
revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary that,
consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer “new”;
which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its
character as a “new invention”, by reason of anticipation by prior
publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two
indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication
and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a “new
invention”. This is counterbalanced by the definition of “new
invention”, which envisages absence of novelty either on account
of anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in
the present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior
use of the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case
having been pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss
of novelty on the ground of anticipation by prior publication.
125.Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly
- and significantly - worded. The words “before the priority date of
the claim” succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words “what
was publicly known or publicly used in India”. No such caveat as
to time follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with
publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred
to in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated,CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 58of69in Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of
novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date
of the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the
priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in
India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section
13. Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the
invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to
in Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit
patent . The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit
patent, does not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the
manner in which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the
legislature.
126.That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of
prior publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e),
is completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem . What, then,
is the terminus ad quem , for the purposes of prior publication under
Section 64(1)(e)? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to
provide a terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e),
which deals with the prior publication, apparently because this part
of the clause is to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which
provides the appropriate terminus ad quem , in clauses (1)(a) and
(2), which have already been reproduced hereinabove, and which
envisage anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad
quem provided in respect of anticipation by prior publication, in
clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13, is the “date of filing of the
applicant's complete specification”, and not the priority date of the
suit patent . The priority date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima
facie irrelevant for the purposes of vulnerability on the ground of
anticipation by prior publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with
Section 13 of the Patents Act. What has to be seen is whether, prior
to the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit
patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in the present case , was published
in India or elsewhere in any document.
127.Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an
invention without disclosure of the invention in the patent?
128.Publication involves making known to the public the patent
application. Every application is required to disclose the invention
for which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents
Act4(already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in
the complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention,
its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed,
but also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which
protection is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to beCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 59of69able to successfully allege that CTPR was published in US’424 and
US’357 (being the US equivalent of EP’508), the defendant would
have to establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents.”
xxxxx
133. Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR.
Besides, they are pharmaceutical patents, relating to
pharmaceutical products for therapeutic administration. There is
also substance in Mr. Sethi's contention that these are also Markush
claims, and cannot, therefore, be said to “teach” synthesising of
CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to convince myself that CTPR
stands claimed, or disclosed, in these patents. Sans any claim or
disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that CTPR was published
either in US’424 or US’357 (or, therefore, in EP’508).”
From Novartis-I
“222. Section 64(1)(e) envisages, as a ground for revocation of a
patent, “that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the
complete specification is not new, having regard to what was
publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of
the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of
the documents referred to in Section 13”. The plea of vulnerability
of the suit patent IN 161 on the ground of anticipation by prior
publication, as advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak, is predicated on the
latter half of this Clause. Section 64(1)(e) refers back to Section
13. Anticipation by publication finds reference in Clauses (1)(a)
and (2) of Section 13. Section 13(1)(a) refers to anticipation by
publication of the applicant's complete specifications in any
specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made
in India and does not, therefore, apply to the ground taken by Mr.
Sai Deepak. Section 13(2) refers to anticipation by publication of
the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete
specification, by publication in India or elsewhere in any document
before the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit
patent. The use of the expression “so far as claimed”, in Section
13(2) would, therefore, require identity in the extent of claim
contained in the specification in the suit patent and in the
specification of the prior art which is cited for the purpose of
alleging anticipation by prior publication.”
59. In para 126 of FMC-II , this Bench has clearly rejected Mr. Sai
Deepak’s contention that the terminus ad quem for determining
anticipation by prior publication is the priority date of the suit patent.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 60of69It is held, in the said para, that the priority date of the suit patent is
prima facie irrelevant, while examining vulnerability on the ground of
anticipation by prior publication and that, when Section 64(1)(e) is
read with Section 13 of the Patents Act, what has to be seen is
whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification of the
suit patent, the asserted invention was published in India or elsewhere
in any document.
60. Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the genus patent WO
2002/36576 (WO’576), equivalent to IN’218 to contend that Claim 1
in the suit patent, i.e. Olaparib, stands anticipated by prior publication
in WO’576. He relies, for this purpose, on Compound 278 in
WO’576, and the process of its synthesis as reflected in the complete
specifications in WO’576.
61. It is obvious at a bare glance that the product compound 278 is
not Olaparib.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 61of6962. Para 83 of the written statement sets out, in a tabular fashion,
the manner in which WO’576 allegedly anticipates, by prior
publication, Olaparib:
WO’576 IN’720
WO’576 discloses the following
Compound
wherein A-B, R Nand R Ccan be
optionally substituted.
Page 4 of the description states the second
aspect of the present invention wherein A
and B together represent an
optionallysubstituted, fused aromatic

RLis optionally substituted phenyl; and
RNis hydrogen.

C(=0)N(CH 3)2, -C(=0) NHCH 2CH 3, and-
C (=0)N (CH 2CH 3) 2, as well as
amidogroups in which R1and R2,
togetherwith the nitrogen atom to which
theyare attached, form a
heterocyclicstructure as in, for
example,piperidinocarbonyl,
morpholinocarbonyl,
thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and
piperazinocarbonyl .
Substitution of RN
RNis hydrogen.
The substitution at the place of R N(in
IN’218) is Hydrogen (H) as stated in the
claim of IN’218CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 64of6963. It is clear, from a bare glance at the manner in which Natco has
arrived at the chemical structure of Olaparib from Claim I in WO’576
that there has been cherry picking of substituents. For example,
(i) in the A-B radical in the WO’576 claim, there is no
explanation for why the example of benzene has been selected
out of the possible substituents of 5- to 6- membered aromatic
rings, out of
(a) benzene,
(b) pyrazine,
(c) pyrrole,
(d) thiazole,
(e) isoxazole and
(f) oxazole,
which, too, are merely mentioned as examples, and
(ii) in the -CH 2-RLsubstitution, while the description of
WO’576 does state that R L, if a benzene ring, is preferably
substituted, there is no explanation for why the halo and
carbonyl substituents should be selected in preference to
(a) C1-7alkyl (more preferably methyl),
(b) CF 3,
(c) C5-20aryl,
(d) C3-20heterocyclyl,
(e) hydroxy,
(f) ether (more preferably methoxy, phenoxy,
benzyloxy and cyclopentyloxy),
(g) nitro, and
(h) cyano,CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 65of69among others. Most significantly, perhaps, there is no teaching, in any
of the cited prior arts, to lead a person skilled in the art to envision the
terminal
 cyclopropane substitution.
64. No other prior publication, which publishes Olaparib, has been
cited by Mr. Sai Deepak either during oral arguments or in written
submissions.
65. No case for anticipation by prior publication is also, therefore,
made out.
VII. Section 3(d)29
66. Mr. Sai Deepak has also sought to invoke Section 3(d) of the
Patents Act to contend that the specifications for Olaparib do not
contain any data to indicate enhanced efficacy over the prior art
IN’218.
67. The fallacy of the submission is obvious. Section 3(d), to the
extent it is at all relevant to the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, applies
only to “new forms” of “known substances”. It cannot be said that
293. What are not inventions . – The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -
*****
(d) the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result in the
enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any new property or
new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, machine or apparatus unless
such known process results in a new product or employs at least one new reactant.
Explanation . – For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs,
metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, combinations and
other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the same substance, unless they
differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacyCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 66of69Olaparib is a new form of the Markush Claim I in IN’720. The
submission, therefore, merits prima facie rejection.
VIII. Section 64(1)(m) read with Section 830
68. On the ground that, while applying for and obtaining the suit
patent, Kudos did not disclose the fact that its applications for grant of
the same patent JP 2006-505955 and JP 2007-226723 were facing
rejection. This, in my opinion, cannot be a basis, in any case, for
Kudos to be regarded as disentitled to an injunction. At the very least,
the matter would be a question of fact, to be decided on the facts of
each individual case.
69. Besides, Section 8 requires the patent applicant in India, who is
prosecuting an application for a patent in another country outside
India in respect of the same invention, to file, along with his
application, a statement setting out the particulars of the application.
The issue of whether, in a case where the patent is registered, or being
prosecuted, in several other jurisdictions, the omission to mention the
308. Information and undertaking regarding foreign applications .—
(1) Where an applicant for a patent under this Act is prosecuting either alone or jointly with
any other person an application for a patent in any country outside India in respect of the same or
substantially the same invention, or where to his knowledge such an application is being prosecuted
by some person through whom he claims or by some person deriving title from him, he shall file
along with his application or subsequently within the prescribed period as the Controller may
allow—
(a) a statement setting out detailed particulars of such application; and
(b) an undertaking that, up to the date of grant of patent in India he would keep the
Controller informed in writing, from time to time, of detailed particulars as required
under clause ( a) in respect of every other application relating to the same or substantially
the same invention, if any, filed in any country outside India subsequently to the filing of
the statement referred to in the aforesaid clause, within the prescribed time.
(2) At any time after an application for patent is filed in India and till the grant of a patent or
refusal to grant of a patent made thereon, the Controller may also require the applicant to furnish
details, as may be prescribed, relating to the processing of the application in a country outside India,
and in that event the applicant shall furnish to the Controller information available to him within
such period as may be prescribed.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 67of69proceedings before one jurisdiction would invalidate the granted
patent altogether is, in my prima facie view, highly arguable. Even
more arguable would be the question of whether, if the omission is
bona fide , the patentee, whose patent is admittedly infringed, can be
refused an interim injunction.
70. In the present case, Kudos has placed, on record, documents,
including correspondences with its patent agent, which, according to
it, indicate that the omission to mention the Japanese patents was not
deliberate, but was an inadvertent omission on the part of the patent
agent. How far this argument would be acceptable is, in my view, a
matter which would have to await trial. In any event, in view of the
explanation, this cannot be regarded as so overwhelming a factor as
would justify rejection of the interim relief that Kudos seeks.
IX. The sequitur
71. As already noted towards beginning of this judgment, several
incidental contentions were raised, including IC 50 values, dosage
data, anti-cancer PARP inhibition data, and the like, all of which
would require a detailed excursion into facts. It would not be justified
for this Court to enter into all these areas, once a prima facie case has
been found to exist in favour of the plaintiff. For the purposes of the
present application, it is admitted, in the first place, that the defendant
is in fact exploiting the suit patent by manufacturing and selling
Olaparib. It is also admitted that this exploitation has take place in
the 19thyear of the life of the suit patent. No credible case ofCS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 68of69vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on any of the grounds
contained in Section 64 of the Patents Act can be said to have been
made out by the Natco. As no credible challenge to the validity of the
suit patent has been made out, the prayer for interlocutory injunction
has necessarily to be granted.
Conclusion
72. For all the aforesaid reasons, the present application succeeds
and is allowed. The defendant shall stand restrained from
manufacturing and selling, or in any manner, dealing with Olaparib,
either under the brand name BRACANAT or under other brand name,
pending disposal of the present suit, so long as the suit patent
continues to remain alive and subsisting.
73. I.A. 907/2023 is allowed accordingly.
IA 153/2023 in CO (Comm. IPD-PAT) 1/2023
74. By this application, Natco seeks an interlocutory injunction
staying the operation of the suit patent and restraining Kudos from
seeking any injunction against Natco exploiting the suit patent.
75. No separate submissions have been advanced in this
application. In any event, the outcome of I.A 907/2023 in CS (Comm)
29/2023 would necessarily also determine the outcome of the present
applications.CS(COMM) 29/2023 and C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 Page 69of6976. Resultantly, I.A. 153/2023 is dismissed.

 	Or isomers, salts or solvates thereof.

3. The application for grant of Suit Patent was filed in India on 31 August 2005 with a priority date of 12 March 2003. It was granted by the Indian Patent Office (IPO) on 10 February 2009.

4. There has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit patent. It is only after the present suit was filed that the defendant Natco Pharma Limited (Natco hereinafter) filed CO (COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023 under Section 64(1)1 of the Patents Act, 1970 (1970), seeking revocation of the suit patent.

5. The compound claimed in Claim I of the suit patent has been assigned the IUPAC name Olaparib.

6. There is no dispute that, even while the suit patent continues to remain alive and subsisting, Natco has manufactured and sold its own generic version of Olaparib under the brand name BRACANAT.

7. This, contends Kudos, amounts to infringement of the suit patent. Kudos has, therefore, instituted the present suit before this Court seeking a decree of permanent injunction, restraining Natco from manufacturing or selling or otherwise dealing with any product with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or otherwise.

8. Olaparib, it may be noted, is an oral poly (ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, used for treating various forms of cancer.  It is stated that, by inhibiting PARP, Olaparib preferentially kills cancer cells.  The mechanics by which Olaparib acts as an anti-cancer drug are not of particular significance, insofar as the present decision is concerned.

9. Along with the suit, the plaintiff has filed IA 907/2023 under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC), seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from manufacturing or selling Olaparib, under any brand name, pending disposal of the present suit.
	
10. This judgment disposes of the said IA 907 of 2023 and I.A. 153/2023 in C.O.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023.

A prefatory note

11. In para 15 of the report in Astrazeneca v. Intas2, the Division Bench of this Court has entered the following cautionary note, in the matter of passing of interlocutory orders in intellectual property matters:
15. 	Supreme Court, in order dated 16th August, 2017 in Civil Appeal No. 18892/2017 titled AZ Tech (India) v. Intex Technologies (India) Limited, commented on the disturbing trend, of the orders of disposal of applications for interim relief in Intellectual Property Rights matters governing parties for a long time, with exhaustive judgments, virtually on merits of the suit, being written and expressed the need for addressing the said malady. In fact, suo moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 8/2017 titled Re : Case Management of Original Suits, was initiated in pursuance to the said order and in which proceedings this Court informed the Supreme Court of the remedial measures being taken.


12. More recently, the Supreme Court, in Pernod Ricard India Pvt. Ltd. v. United Spirits Ltd3, echoed the above sentiment in the following words:
At the insistence of counsel for the petitioner, we clarify that it is well settled proposition of law that decisions on interlocutory applications are only made to protect rival interests pending suit. Somehow the interim applications itself are treated as final decision but it is not so. In all such cases, interim arrangements should be made and the trial should proceed rather than to spend time only on interlocutory applications. That protects the petitioner against the apprehension that the impugned judgment may be cited in other Court qua petitioners cases of a similar nature.

13. The present order is passed on an interlocutory application under Order XXXIX of the CPC.  All that the Court has to see, therefore, is whether there is a prima facie case in favour of the plaintiff, whether the refusal of interim relief would result in irreparable loss to the plaintiff, and which way the balance of convenience would lie.  A threadbare analysis of the entire dispute, and findings which partake of a final expression of opinion on all issues in controversy, is neither justified, nor even appropriate, at this stage.  

14. Arguments in this case extended over several days.  Written submissions have also been tendered by both sides, with the submissions of the plaintiff extending to 53 pages.  If I were to return findings on every issue argued, and on every plea urged, hardly anything would survive for consideration in the suit.  

15. The attempt is, therefore, to ensure that this order conforms to the discipline of Order XXXIX of the CPC.

Rival Contentions

16. I have heard Mr. Pravin Anand, learned counsel for Kudos, and Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the Natco at exhaustive length. 

Submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand

17. Mr. Pravin Anand advanced the following submissions to justify his prayer for interlocutory injunction:

(i) Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in Claim  I of the suit patent IN720.

(ii) During the life of the suit patent and till the filing of C.O. (COMM.IPD-PAT) 1/2023, there has been no pre-grant or post-grant opposition to the suit patent, which stands granted in as many as 61 countries.

(iii) The first act of infringement of the suit patent, by Natco, has taken place when the suit patent is in the 19th year of its life.  The suit patent is, therefore, an old patent and is, therefore, prima facie entitled to be treated as valid, strong and liable to be enforced against third party infringers. 

(iv) Olaparib was also covered by IN 245218 (IN218) registered in favor of the plaintiff which expired on 25 October 2021 titled Substituted Benzyl Phthalazinones. 

(v) Claim I in IN720 was as under :
WE CLAIM: 
  A compound of the formula : 

    


Or an isomer, salt, solvate, chemically protected form, and prodrug thereof, wherein :
A and B together represent an optionally mono-substituted, fused aromatic ring: Rc is -CH2-RL;
RL is phenyl substituted by a substituent selected from the group consisting of :
C3-20 heterocyclyl; esler; amido; ureido; sulfonamino; and acyloxy and optionally further substituted; and 
RN is hydrogen.

This is a Markush claim which covers, depending on the selected substitutions from the suggested substitutions provided in the claim, a large number of compounds  worked out in the written submission of the plaintiff as in the range of 93600 million.  This figure is not disputed by Natco.  One among these is Olaparib. 

(vi) Thus, IN218 neither claims nor discloses Olaparib. Olaparib is merely one of the millions of compounds which fall within the broad Markush coverage of Claim I in IN218. 

(vii) The specifications in IN218 do not contain the necessary teaching to guide a person skilled in the art to synthesize Olaparib.

(viii) Natco is admittedly manufacturing and selling Olaparib.  Olaparib is specifically disclosed and claimed in the suit patent IN720.  The fact that Natco is infringing the suit patent, therefore, stands admitted. 

(ix) Natco has not cleared the way before infringing the suit patent.  It has not filed any pre or post grant opposition to the suit patent. C.O. (COMM.) IPD-PAT 1/2023 has also been filed by Natco only after the present suit was instituted by Kudos. The very fact that Natco chose to launch its own generic version of Olaparib, admittedly infringing the suit patent, without, in the first instance, clearing the way, entitles Kudos to interlocutory injunction. 

(x) Clearing the way, moreover, would require Natco not to just to file a revocation petition challenging the suit patent, but also to succeed in its challenge.  For the proposition that the very act of infringing of the suit patent without Natco having first clear the way entitles Kudos to an interim injunction, Mr. Anand relies on para 87 of the report in Merck Sharp and Dohme Corporation v. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals4 passed by the Division Bench of this Court, the decision of the UK High Court Actavis v.  Lilly5 and on the decision of the UK Court of Appeal in Novartis AG v. Hospira6.

(xi) While it is true that, to justifiably oppose a prayer for interim injunction, the defendant in a patent infringement suit is only required to set up a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent, it cannot be said that Natco has set up such a challenge.  

(xii) In F. Hoffman La Roche v. Cipla Ltd7 and Intex Technologies (India) Ltd.  v. Telefonaktiebolaget L.M. Ericsson8, a credible challenge has been identified as one which is strong, and which is not fanciful or moonshine.   In assessing whether a challenge is credible, the Division Bench in both these decisions has held that the fact that the inventor had been granted a patent for his invention after thorough scrutiny by the Indian Patent Office was a relevant factor which had to be accorded due weightage. 

(xiii) The fact that no pre-grant or post-grant opposition had been filed to the suit patent, till Natco decided to file a revocation petition in the 19th year of the life of the suit patent is also a recognition of the validity of the suit patent and a factor which entitles Kudos to interim injunction, applying the law laid down by the House of Lords in American Cyanamide v. Ethicon Ltd9. 

(xiv)  On the erroneous presumption that coverage implies disclosure, Natco was seeking to incorrectly contend that Olaparib stood disclosed in IN218.  In actual fact, coverage and disclosure are distinct and different concepts. Coverage does not imply disclosure. The fact that coverage and disclosure are different and distinct stand acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Novartis AG v. UOI10  as well as by the Division Bench of Court in para 11.18.7 of its decision in FMC Corporation v. Natco Pharma Ltd.11 and by this Bench in Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd12.

(xv) Disclosure of a chemical compound in a patent is done only through an individual identification of that compound in the patent document by its chemical name, chemical structure, chemical formula, IUPAC name etc.  Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on paras 283 and 329 of the judgment of the Federal Court of Australia in Eli-Lilly and Co. Ltd. v. Apotex Pty Ltd.13 

(xvi) In FMC-I, the Division Bench held that disclosure of a compound in a genes patent cannot be presumed. 

(xvii)  The Supreme Court, in its judgment in Biswanath Prasad v. Hindustan Metal Industries14  and the US Court of Appeals in Fujikawa v. Wattanasin15 hold that the issue of disclosure of a patent in specifications is a question of fact, which has to be proved by clear and convincing evidence. 

(xviii) There is a difference between coverage and claiming.  The fact that Olaparib is covered under the overall Markush claim in IN218 does not result in Olaparib being vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming. 

(xix) In order for a claim in a patent to be invalided on the ground of prior claiming, the invention in the two claims must be identical. The Markush Claim I in IN218 is clearly different from Claim I in the suit patent which specifically claims and discloses Olaparib. This has been sought to be demonstrated thus:


In the genus patent IN218, though millions of compounds could be synthesized from the Markush Claim I, only 265 compounds were exemplified, and Olaparib was not one amongst them.  In order for a claim in a species patent to be invalidated on the ground of prior claim in the genus patent, the disclosure in the genus patent must be enabling; in other words, it must enable a person skilled in the art to arrive at the species patent from the teachings which it provides. Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on The General Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Firestone Tyre and Rubber Co. Ltd.16 

(xx) There can be no question of double patenting or prior claiming where the scope of earlier and later patent is different. 

(xxi) In order to support his contention that the mere coverage of the claim in the species patent, in the overall Markush structure in the genus patent does not invalidate the species patent on the ground of prior claiming, Mr. Anand relies on para 63.2 to 63.6 of Novartis-I, paras 12.5, 12.7 & 12.18 of the judgment of this Bench in FMC Corporation v. Best Crop Science LLP17 and paras 191, 192 and 195 of Novartis AG v. Natco Pharma Ltd.18, paras 10.5 to 10.8 of Astrazeneca v. Torrent19 and paras 26 to 30 of the Judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in Dr. Reddys Laboratories (UK) Ltd. v. Eli Lilly and Co. Ltd20.  

(xxii) If Natcos submissions were to be accepted, it would invalidate all selection patents, which are recognized in this country.  Natco was seeking to contend that all species patents were patents of addition under Section 3421 and had, therefore, necessarily to terminate with the genus patent.  This was a seriously flawed submission, and went against the well-recognized theory of selection patents. Selection patents were valid subject to their satisfying the three factor test, postulated in Re. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.s Patents22, followed by this Court in its decision in FMC-I.

(xxiii) The suit patent could not be treated as a patent of addition under Section 5423 of the Patents Act, as was sought to be contended by Natco.  A patent of addition was filed with respect to minor improvements over an invention described or disclosed in an earlier patent. Olaparib is neither described nor disclosed in the genus patent IN218. Moreover, Olaparib was not a mere improvement over the genus patent but constitutes an entirely new invention. 

(xxiv) The reliance on Section 53(4)24 of the Patents Act, by Natco is also misplaced. Natco was seeking to contend that, by operation of Section 53(4), the expiry of the genus patent IN218 resulted ipso facto in falling, into the public domain all subject matter covered by the genus patent even if it was neither claimed nor disclosed in it.  This was a fundamentally misplaced submission. The protection available under Section 53(4) was as much available to the species patents as to the genus patent.  It is well-settled that multiple patents can cover the same product. In such a case, the expiry of genus patent does not result automatically into expiry of the species patents or evisceration of the protection available under Section 53(4) to the species patent. 

(xxv)  This was clear from the expression notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, with which Section 53(4) commences. The Patents Act could not be treated as other law for the purposes of Section 53(4). While, therefore, Section 53(4) had supervening application over other laws, it was nonetheless subject to the Patents Act and, especially, to Sections 19, 91(1) and 141 (1) thereof.  Reliance was placed, for the interpretation any other law on the judgment of the Supreme Court in P. Virudhachalam v. Management of Lotus Mills25 . The correct interpretation to be placed on Section 53 (4) was, therefore, that all compounds disclosed by the genus patent would be open to the public upon its expiry. Inasmuch as Olaparib was not specifically disclosed in the genus patent IN218, the expiry of IN218 did not render Olaparib available in the public domain for anyone to exploit.  

(xxvi)   A plea that Olaparib was disclosed in the Russian Genus Patent RU865 was also incorrect. Natco was seeking to contend that RU865  which was the Russian equivalent to IN218  also claimed a medicament used to treat cancer via PARP inhibition. The reliance on RU865 was, however, misplaced as RU865 did not disclose that any drug, let alone Olaparib, commercially emerged from RU865.

(xxvii) Natco had sought to rely on the Form 27s filed by Kudos, for the genus patent IN218 and the species patent IN720. The filing of Form 27 did not amount to any kind of admission that Olaparib was specifically disclosed in both the patents. One product can conceivably be covered by several patents and several patents could cover a single commercial product. This position stands statutorily recognized by Sections 3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141 of the Patents Act.  The amended form 27 requires all patentees to file a single Form 27 for multiple patents, provided all patents are related or worked through one product.  As such, the fact that one Form 27 had been filed both for species patent IN720 and genus patent IN218 did not constitute any admission that both disclosed Olaparib. They were merely related patents, as genie and species patents respectively. 

(xxviii) Similarly, the Patent Term Extension (PTE) application filed by Kudos in respect of Australian Patent AU 2001295789 (AU789)  which corresponded to the Indian genus Patent IN218  was completely irrelevant and did not constitute any admission that Olaparib was disclosed in the genus patent.  The Patents Act in Australia provides PTEs to account for delay which could occur when obtaining regulatory approvals for pharmaceuticals.  Reliance has been placed, in this context, on Sections 70 to 79A of the Australian Patents Act 1990. The above legal position stands exposited by this Court in paras 67, 67.1 and 67.2 of its judgment in  Novartis-I. 

(xxix) In PCT application WO 2021/224381 of Kudos, there was an inadvertent statement that Olaparib was disclosed in WO976, which corresponded to the genus patent IN218.  Immediate corrective steps had been taken by Kudos to rectify this error and it now stands clarified that Olaparib was described in WO976, which corresponds to IN720, the species patent. That this was an error is also manifested from the fact that Kudos applied for several other patents related to Olaparib, referring to WO976 as the patent which described Olaparib.  Specific instances in this regard have been provided. 

(xxx) The challenge to the validity of the suit patent IN720 on the ground that it suffered from insufficiency of disclosure under Section 64(1)(h) was not one which could be examined by the court at an interlocutory stage. It was a question of fact, not a question of law, and would have to be decided only once evidence was led and Kudos was granted an opportunity to cross examine its witnesses.  Reliance is placed, for this purpose, on the judgment of this Court in Communication Components Antenna Inc v. Mobi Antenna Technologies (Shenzen) Co. Ltd.26 and on Terrell on the Law of Patents.

(xxxi) Natcos reliance on Section 8(2) to the Patents Act, vis-à-vis the omission on Kudos part to reveal details of the Patent Applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), corresponding to the suit patent IN720 during the time of prosecution of the application resulting in its grant, before the Indian Patent office, was also unsustainable.  Reliance has been placed, in this context, on a letter written to Kudos by its Agent on 14 December 2007, informing Kudos of the Section 8 objection raised by the IPO and requesting Kudos to supply the search and examination report for corresponding patent applications filed in the US and Europe.  Such an inadvertent, unintentional error would not amount to violation of Section 8(2) so as to disentitle the patentee to interlocutory relief. Reliance has been placed, in this context, on paras 27 and 28 of the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Sukesh Bahl v. K. Philips Electronics27 and paras 123 to 125 of F. Hoffman La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd28.  In any case the Kudos stood to gain nothing by suppressing the patent applications filed before the Japanese Patent Office (JPO), as both applications had been granted.  

(xxxii) Natcos contention that the suit patent IN720 suffered from lack of inventive step, as it had not demonstrated any technical advance of Olaparib over prior art, was contrary to the very words of Section 2(1) (ja) of the Patents Act, which defined inventive step as meaning a feature of an invention that involves technical advance compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.  As such, technical advance over prior art is not a mandatory pre-requisite for an inventive step to be found to be involved in a patent claim.  Economic significance of the product related to the claim would also suffice to make out an inventive step.  Olaparib definitely possesses economic significance over prior art. It is sold over 90 countries, used for the treatment of multiple tumour types, and is a certified blockbuster drug, with sales revenues of over USD 2.3 billion in 2021.   In 2016, the US FDA had granted breakthrough therapy status to Olaparib for treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.   The very definition of a therapy as breakthrough indicated that it possessed substantial improvement over existing therapy.  Mr. Anand places reliance on literature explaining the concept of a breakthrough therapy.  

(xxxiii) It is only if the suit patent were to lack in inventive steps, as envisaged by Section 2(1) (ja), that it could be said to be vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of prior claiming.  Inasmuch as Olaparib could not be said to lack in inventive step over prior art, the suit patent was not vulnerable to invalidity for want of obviousness. 

(xxxiv) In order to be valid, a claim for patenting an invention was not required to demonstrate superiority of the invention over prior art. All that was required to be shown was that the invention satisfies the test of novelty, non-obviousness and utility. 

(xxxv) In view of the fact that the genus patent IN218 did not contain the teaching to lead a person skilled in the art to synthesize Olaparib, as the compound claimed in Claim I of the species patent in IN720, from the Markush formula claimed in Claim I of the genus patent, and it was possible to synthesize Olaparib from the Markush claim in the genus patent only by cherry-picking the substituents from the several suggested substitutions in Claim I, and substituting them on the Markush radicals by employing hindsight reconstruction, it was clear that the Olaparib could not be said to be disclosed, much less claimed, in Claim I of the genus patent IN218.

For all these reasons, among others, Mr. Anand submits that, as the fact of infringement is indisputable, and as Natco has not succeeded in setting up a credible challenge to the suit patent, indicating that it is vulnerable to invalidity, Kudos is entitled to an interlocutory injunction as sought. 

18. Inasmuch as the defendant has, undisputedly, manufactured and sold generic Olaparib during the life of the suit patent, the fact of infringement of the suit patent by the defendant, as understood stricto sensu, cannot be disputed either.  Mr. Sai Deepak, however, invokes Section 107, read with clauses (a), (d), (e), (f), (j), (k) and (m) of Section 64(1) of the Patents Act to defend the charge of infringement, and the reliefs sought by Kudos on that basis.  He also submits that, for defending an allegation of infringement, and successfully opposing a prayer for interlocutory injunction, a defendant is only required to put forward a credible challenge, demonstrating the suit patent to be vulnerable to invalidity on one or the other grounds envisaged by Section 64(1).  His submissions, according to him, meet that standard.

19. To save time and space, I propose to decide this application by dealing, seriatim, with the various points of defence raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-vis the submissions of Mr. Pravin Anand in that regard.  In doing so, aspects which involve detailed examination of facts and which, therefore, would merit an exhaustive analysis after both sides are given an opportunity to lead evidence, are not being addressed, adhering to the discipline of Astrazeneca-I and Pernod Ricard.  I shall, however, note the said issues towards the conclusion of this order.

The consideration of credible challenge

20. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that the defendant is only required to raise a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent in order to succeed in its defence against infringement.

21. There is no dispute about this legal position.

22. However, it is necessary to understand what credible challenge means. In this context, this court has held, in para 19 of FMC-II, paras 178 and 231 to 233 of Novartis I and para 129 of Novartis II thus:

FMC-II
19. 	Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity of the plaintiff's patent need not be such as to demonstrate, conclusively, the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant is able to make out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to revocation under the Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however, to be demonstrated by way of a credible challenge. The onus would be on the defendant, therefore, to establish the credibility of the challenge raised by it. The challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful, or moonshine. It must not strain the sinews of acceptability. There can, however, needless to say, be no fixed standard on the basis of which the credibility of the challenge can be assessed. It would be for the Court, in each case, therefore, to ascertain, for itself, whether the challenge raised by the defendant, to the validity of the suit patent, is, or is not, credible.

Novartis I

 178. 	 The challenge in this regard must be credible. Credibility indicates that, on the face of the challenge, it must merit favourable consideration. A credible challenge occupies a higher pedestal than a challenge, which is merely worthy of consideration.

xxxxx
231. 	Before closing the discussion, I wish to enter a final observation. There appears, prima facie, to me, to be a fundamental misconception relating the concepts of a credible challenge and of vulnerability. The submissions advanced by the defendant seem to have been predicated on the premise that the slightest shadow of doubt, which could be cast on the suit patent, was sufficient to constitute a credible challenge, exposing its vulnerability to revocation. This proposition, according to me, is completely misconceived. Para 28 of the report in Bishwanath Prasad Radheyshyamrecognises the fact that, prior to grant of a patent, especially for a pharmaceutical product, a thorough study is normally undertaken by the Patent Office, regarding the validity of the patent as sought. When an infringer seeks to defend infringement on the ground that the patent that he infringes is invalid, the onus, to prove such invalidity heavily lies on him. This standard has to be met, when applying the principle of credibility. Repeated attempts were made to convince me that any and every ground that the defendant sought to raise, and for which a cast iron response from the plaintiff was not immediately forthcoming, was sufficient to establish vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation. Revocation is a drastic act, and a patent, once granted, cannot be treated as easily vulnerable to revocation. Even if, prima facie, a ground for revocation is made out, as is noted in Merck v. Glenmark, revocation is not automatic, but remains a matter of discretion, for the patent authority. The grant of such discretion is itself a pointer to the legislative intent that, before revoking a patent, the authority is required to satisfy itself, that, all considerations having been mould in mind, revocation is absolutely necessary. Vulnerability to revocation has also to be judged on the same standard. It is only when, judged on that standard, a credible challenge to the validity of the patent as vulnerable to revocation is made out, that an infringer can escape the consequences of infringement. The standard is, therefore, high, rather than low.

232. 	This would especially be so in a situation, as in the present case, the infringer never choose to challenge the suit patent either at pre-grant or at post-grant stage, by filing oppositions. The defendants have not, therefore, cleared the way, before exploiting the suit patent. Mr. Sai Deepak sought to contend that, by deferring the release of their Eltrombopag Olamine, till the expiry of the term of IN 176, the defendants had sufficiently cleared the way. Mr. Hemant Singh has disputed this contention, and I confess that I agree with him. IN 161 was granted as far back as on 27th March, 2009. It has remained in force for 12 years. The defendants have neither chosen to launch any pre-grant or post-grant, opposition to IN 161. Nor have they filed any proceedings before the patent office or the IPAB, to cancel or suspend the registration granted to IN 161. Rather, even while IN 161 continues to remain valid, the defendants have, without blinking an eyelid, sought to exploit the subject matter of the said patent, i.e. EO. That they have done so with the full awareness that EO is specifically claimed in IN 161, is not disputed. Clearly, therefore, the defendants have, by their attitude, as well as by failing to clear the way before exploiting the suit patent, IN 161, exposed themselves to an interlocutory injunction.

233. 	It is only when they have been caught in the act, as it were, that the infringer defendants, unable to dispute the charge of infringement on facts, seek to question the validity of the suit patent. While Section 64, undoubtedly, allow them to do so, the challenge has to be credible, not incredible. The defendants, in the present case, neither launched any pre-grant nor any post-grant, opposition to IN 161. They have not initiated any proceeding before IPAB or any other authority, for revocation, cancellation or removal of the suit patent from the register of patents. In such circumstances, the holder of the suit patent would ordinarily be entitled to an injunction against continued infringement. Absent any prima facie case of vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation on the ground of invalidity, therefore, injunction cannot be refused, once infringement is established.

Novartis II

 129. 	In fact, Natco has, in its submissions, completely glossed over the most important query which it would have to answer, in order to set up even a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent, vis-à-vis a Markush prior art. The suit patent could be said to be vulnerable to invalidity, vis-à-vis known Markush prior art, only if it is established, cumulatively, that

(i) 	from the known prior art, it is possible to arrive at the suit patent, by effecting suggested substitutions in the Markush formula claimed in the prior art, from the substitutions suggested therein, and

(ii) the Markush prior art contains the requisite teaching, as would suggest the substitutions which are to be so made in order to arrive at the suit patent.


23. Thus, the onus to establish that the challenge raised by it is credible, is on the respondent. A credible challenge, as Mr. Pravin Anand has correctly submitted, is a challenge which is not incredible, fanciful, or moonshine, and must prima facie be acceptable. On its face, the challenge must merit favorable consideration. It is not enough for the defendant to raise a challenge which is worthy of consideration. The challenge must be more than that; it must partake of the character of prima facie acceptability. credibility, even by itself, connotes a fairly high standard. In examining whether the challenge raised is credible, a relevant consideration is the fact that the Patent Office has, after a thorough study, found the patent to be valid and capable of being granted. In Merck, the Division Bench of this Court held that, even if a ground for revocation of a granted patent was made out, revocation was not an inevitable sequitur, but that the patent authority retained discretion in that regard.  The same standard has to be adopted while examining vulnerability to revocation. The standard of credibility is, therefore, a high standard, not a low standard, as is commonly understood.

II.	The decision in Astrazeneca-I

24. Mr. Sai Deepak laid great stress on the decision in Astrazeneca-I.  According to him, the view taken by this Bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II can no longer be followed after the decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I.  As against this, Mr. Pravin Anand points out that, when the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II was cited before the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, the Division Bench did not overrule the decision, but only distinguished it on the ground that, in FMC-II, only the specie patent was asserted by the plaintiff whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, both genus and specie patent were asserted.  

25. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that the observation that, in FMC-II, the specie patent alone was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, both genus and specie patent were asserted, was merely a closing observation of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, and to accord that closing observation pre-eminence over all other findings of the Division Bench would be a lopsided approach.  He submits that the closing observation regarding the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II does not dilute the rigour of the rest of the judgment in Astrazeneca-I, or take away its precedential value.  The findings in the decision, he submit, apply on all fours to the facts at hand, and are directly contrary to the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II.  All those findings cannot, he submit, be overlooked merely because of the closing observation differentiating the decision in FMC-II from the facts which were before the Division Bench.

Effect of reference, in Astrazeneca-I, to the decision in FMC-II

26. In so submitting, Mr. Sai Deepak overlooks the fact that, had the Division Bench felt that the view expressed by this Bench in FMC-II was wrong, the easiest thing would have to be to overrule it.  Indeed, that would be the only natural course of action which the Division Bench would ordinarily have followed.  The Division Bench did not, however, do so, and it would, therefore, be overreaching the decision of the Division Bench if one were to read Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II.  It appears, prima facie, incongruous if an interpreter of a judgment were, in the process of interpreting, to rewrite the judgment as doing what the author of the judgment could have done, but did not choose to do.   

27. The Division Bench, therefore, consciously refrained from overruling the view of this Bench in FMC-II.  The words used by the Division Bench are of stellar significance.  The Division Bench observes:
51. 	The counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, on 12th July, 2021 mentioned the matter, to draw attention to judgment dated 7th July, 2021 in applications for interim relief in CS(COMM) No. 69/2021 and CS(COMM) No. 661/2019 titled FMC Corporation v. Best Crop Science LLP. In taking the view aforesaid, we have considered the said judgment also, in which infringement of one patent only was claimed.
(Emphasis supplied)

28.  Nothing, in my considered opinion, could be plainer.  The Division Bench was specifically shown the decision of this Bench in FMC-II.  The Division Bench noted that, in arriving at its view, it had also considered the decision of this Bench in FMC-II.  After considering the decision of this Bench in FMC-II, the Division Bench propounded the view that it did, and the identifying and distinguishing feature of the judgment of this Bench in FMC-II is, clearly, from the italicised words in para 52 of the report in Astrazeneca-I, the fact that, in FMC-II, only the specie patent was asserted, whereas, in Astrazeneca-I, Astrazeneca asserted both the genie and specie patent, contending that the impugned invention of Intas infringed both patents.  It is because of this distinguishing feature that the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, without disturbing the decision of this Bench in FMC, held as it did.  That much, according to me, is clear from para 52 of Astrazeneca-I.

29. It would, therefore, be folly, according to me, for any hierarchically subordinate Court, or Bench, to interpret the decision of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I as overruling FMC-II, or even as disapproving the view expressed therein.

Assuming Mr Sai Deepaks contention to be correct  Discussion in main body of the decision in Astrazeneca-I


30. Even if one were to go along with Mr. Sai Deepaks submission, and advert to the body of the Astrazeneca-I decision, one finds that the Division Bench has proceeded almost entirely on the consideration that Astrazeneca had, in its suit, asserted both the genus and the specie patents.  It is helpful, in this context, to vivisect the Astrazeneca-I decision into its individual components, as that would help a great deal in understanding what the Division Bench went on to hold.  For this purpose, the para numbers to which I allude are the para numbers of the report in the SCC OnLine journal.

31. Astrazeneca, in its suit, asserted two patents; IN 205147 (IN 147) and IN 235625 (IN625).  On the basis thereof, Astrazeneca sought an injunction against Intas manufacturing or otherwise dealing in Dapagliflozin (DAPA).  The facts of the case are not of much significance, and are contained in paras 1 to 14 of the report.  

32. The Division Bench proceeds, in para 16 of the report, to enumerate the contentions of learned Counsel for Astrazeneca.  Thereafter, paras 17 to 21, the Division Bench observes thus:
17. 	Though ordinarily we would have recorded the arguments of the counsels for the respondent(s)/defendant(s) also but need therefor is not felt in the facts of the present case since during the hearing itself, we entertained doubts/reservations as spelled out herein below, and which doubts inter alia also form the defence of the respondent(s)/defendant(s).

18. 	Our doubts stemmed from, the appellants/plaintiffs averring and pleading manufacture and sale by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA to be in infringement of two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. It was felt, that if DAPA was not disclosed and/or known at the time of seeking patent IN 147 or US equivalent thereof and was invented only subsequently and patent thereof obtained in IN 625 or US equivalent thereof, there could be no infringement by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 by manufacturing and/or selling DAPA. Conversely, once the appellants/plaintiffs claimed infringement of IN 147 also, it necessarily followed that DAPA was subject matter thereof and once it was the subject matter thereof, how it could be the subject matter of subsequent patent IN 625.

19. 	It was thus enquired from the counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, that if the patent IN 147 was/is not of DAPA, how could the appellants/plaintiffs in the suits from which these appeals arise, claim infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of IN 147 also, by manufacturing DAPA. It was further enquired, whether not from the factum of the appellants/plaintiffs, in the suits from which these appeals arise, having claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 as well as IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are deemed to have admitted DAPA as the subject matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625.

20. 	We, at this stage, spell out the thought process behind the aforesaid query.

21. 	In our opinion, with respect to one invention, there can be only one patent. The appellants/plaintiffs herein however, while claiming one invention only i.e. DAPA, are claiming two patents with respect thereto, with infringement of both, by the respondent(s)/defendant(s). The same alone, in our view, strikes at the very root of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs and disentitles the appellants/plaintiffs from any interim relief.
(Emphasis supplied)


33. Paras 25 to 28, 31, 32, 36, 43 and 45 of the report proceed to observe thus:
25. 	With invention, as defined in the statute, forming the core of a patent and the appellants/plaintiffs in their suits having claimed only one invention i.e. DAPA, as subject matter of both the patents, we wondered whether there could be two patents with respect to the same invention and proceeded to examine the two patents, to decipher the invention claimed in each.

26. 	IN 147 sets out the field of invention as under:
      The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases, employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents.
27. 	IN 625 sets out the field of invention as under:
      The present invention relates to C-aryl glucosides which are inhibitors of sodium dependent glucose transporters found in the intestine and kidney (SGLT2) and to a method for treating diabetes, especially type II diabetes, as well as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, diabetic complications, atherosclerosis and related diseases, employing such C-aryl glucosides alone or in combination with one, two or more other type antidiabetic agent and/or one, two or more other type therapeutic agents such as hypolipidemic agents.
28. 	As would immediately be obvious from above, there is complete identity, without any difference whatsoever, between the field of invention as set out in the two patents i.e. IN 147 and IN 625. For IN 625 to be with respect to a new product involving an inventive step i.e. a feature involving a technical advance as compared to existing knowledge including of IN 147 or having economic significance and which was not anticipated by earlier publication or use including of IN 147, to say the least, we expected the description of the field of invention in IN 625 to describe the technical advancement and/or the difference in efficacy, from that in IN 147.

*****

31. 	The Patents Act, though protects the rights and interests of inventors, but for a limited period, whereafter the monopoly of the patentee ceases and comes to an end and the invention with respect to which patent was granted, falls in public domain i.e. open for all to practice and reap benefit of. A patent, vide Section 48 of the Act, confers a right on the patentee of a product patent, as DAPA is, to, during the life of the patent, prevent others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing, the new product with respect whereto patent is granted. The life of a patent is limited, whereafter, notwithstanding the new product having been invented by the patentee, patentee no longer has exclusive right to make, use or offer for sale the same and anyone else interested can also make, use or offer for sale the said new product invented by the patentee, without any interference from the patentee. If patents with respect to the same invention can be granted more than once, successively in time, the same will negate the legislative intent of limiting the life of the patent and enable the patentee to prevent others from making, using or offering for sale, the new product invented by the patentee, till the time patentee successively keeps on obtaining patent therefor.

32. 	As far as the arguments of the counsel for the appellants/plaintiffs, of DAPA being only covered and not disclosed in IN 147 and being disclosed for the first time in IN 625, and of DAPA being not obvious from and capable of being anticipated from IN 147 are concerned, we are also of the opinion that once the appellants/plaintiffs, in the plaints in their suits claimed the action of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of manufacturing medicines having DAPA as their ingredient to be an infringement of both IN 147 and IN 625, the appellants/plaintiffs are deemed to have admitted DAPA to be the invention subject matter of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Without DAPA being disclosed in IN 147, there could be no patent with respect to DAPA in IN 147 and which was being infringed by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) by manufacturing drugs/medicines with DAPA as ingredient.
*****

36. 	From the aforesaid provisions it follows, that from IN 147 and/or US equivalent thereof, the invention as described therein could be worked by anyone, save for the exclusivity for the term thereof in favour of the appellants/plaintiffs. However the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs is, that DAPA was not disclosed in the specifications of IN 147 but 80 other compounds were disclosed. However if that were to be the case, it being not the case of the appellants/plaintiffs that the respondent(s)/defendant(s) were manufacturing any of the said 80 compounds, the appellants/plaintiffs, for manufacture by respondent(s)/defendant(s) of DAPA, cannot claim infringement of IN 147 and could have claimed infringement only of IN 625 in which DAPA was disclosed.

*****

43. 	However, under the Indian regime, patent is to be sought and granted with respect to a new product or process. Product is not defined in the Act. The said word is thus deemed to have been used in the Act, as commonly understood. Product is understood as something that is made to be sold, usually something that is produced by an industrial process or, less commonly, something that is grown or obtained through farming. However, the arguments of the appellants/plaintiffs before us make out IN 147 to be a discovery/invention of a group of formulations, which was capable, with further research, of acting as a drug/medicine for inhibiting re-absorption of sugar in kidneys. The appellants/plaintiffs, on the basis thereof could not have manufactured any drug/medicine and have not pleaded any drug/medicine manufactured post IN 147 and thus it prima facie appears, could not have restrained any other person who discovered DAPA, even if from IN 147. In fact we wondered, why the appellants/plaintiffs have pleaded and claimed infringement by the respondent(s)/defendant(s) of both, IN 147 and IN 625. Though in response to our query aforesaid, we expected the appellants/plaintiffs to confine their claim for infringement to IN 625 only but the appellants/plaintiffs stuck to their stand of the respondent(s)/defendant(s) being also in infringement of IN 147. It is obvious therefrom that the appellants/plaintiffs have no legs to stand on, by claiming infringement of IN 625 only, without also claiming infringement of IN 147. However, as held in the impugned judgment/order dated 2nd November, 2020, the question of the respondent(s)/defendant(s), by working DAPA, infringing IN 147 could arise only if DAPA was disclosed in IN 147. If DAPA was disclosed in IN 147, even if better disclosed in IN 625, cannot enjoy two rounds of 20 years of protection, when the legislative policy is to grant protection for a period of one term of 20 years only.

*****
45. 	We, at least at this stage are unable to, in the face of the aforesaid pleadings of the appellants/plaintiffs themselves, find any difference between IN 147 and IN 625. The appellants/plaintiffs themselves are found to be pleading DAPA to have been disclosed generally in IN 147 and specifically in IN 625. In the face of the said pleading, no case for injuncting the respondent(s)/defendant(s) during the pendency of the suits is made out. As aforesaid, we entertain doubt as to the very basis of the claim of the appellants/plaintiffs, as noted in the judgment/order dated 2nd November, 2020 identifying the key question in the dispute to be whether the compound-in-issue i.e. Dapagliflozin [in short DAPA] which, according to the plaintiffs, is covered in IN 147 stands disclosed both, in law as well as on facts.


34. In the face of the afore-extracted passages, it would be facile to even suggest that the simultaneous assertion, by Astrazeneca, of the genus patent IN147 and the species patent IN625, resulting in the allegation that the manufacture and sale, by Intas, of dapagliflozin infringed both the genus and the species patents, did not play a predominant role in the Division Bench holding as it did. In para 18, the Division Bench holds that, by simultaneously claiming infringement of the genus and the species patent, Astrazeneca had admitted that DAPA was the subject matter of both patents. In para 21, it is observed, even more significantly, that Astrazeneca was claiming two patents...with infringement of both. This act of Astrazeneca in claiming both the genus and the species patent through DAPA, and alleging infringement of both patents by Intas, was found by the Division Bench to strike at the very root of the claim of Astrazeneca, disentitling it to any interim relief. The simultaneous assertion by Astrazeneca of the genus and the species patent, and the consequent allegation that the manufacturer of DAPA by Intas had infringed both patents, was found by the Division Bench, in para 32 of the report, to amount to a deemed admission, by Astrazeneca, that DAPA was the invention subject matter of both the genus and the species patents. By thus claiming the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas as infringing the genus and the species patents, the Division Bench observed that Astrazeneca had impliedly acknowledged the disclosure of DAPA in the complete specifications both of the genus and the species patent. Thus, the act of Astrazeneca, in alleging the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing the genus as well as the species patent, was found to foreclose Astrazeneca from maintaining any stand that the genus patent did not disclose DAPA. 

35. This position is even more prominently underscored in para 36 of the report, in which the Division Bench holds that if the case of Astrazeneca were that DAPA was not disclosed in the genus patent, though 80 other compounds were disclosed, DAPA could not have blamed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas, to be infringing the genus patent IN147.  Para 39 of the report again emphasizes the view of the Division Bench, that, if the genus patent IN147 did not disclose DAPA, AstraZeneca could not have claimed the manufacture and sale of DAPA by Intas to be infringing IN147. The concluding observation in para 39 specifically holds that the act of Astrazeneca in pleading infringement of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625 had, at least at the interlocutory stage, to be treated as an admission, by Astrazeneca, of DAPA being a known substance, while obtaining the genus patent.

36. Para 43 of the report gives voice to the concern, of the Division Bench, as to why Astrazeneca had pleaded and claimed infringement, by Intas, of both the genus and the species patents. Significantly, the paragraph goes on to observe that, when the Division Bench had queried Astrazeneca in that regard, it was expected that Astrazeneca would confine their claim of infringement only to the species patent  which is what Kudos has done in the present case.  The obvious sequitur is that, had Astrazeneca restricted its claim of infringement to the species patent, instead of alleging infringement of the genus and species patent both, the outcome of the judgment would have been different.  The submission of Mr. Sai Deepak that the ultimate decision in Astrazeneca-I would not be different even if Astrazeneca had asserted only the species patent, instead of asserting genus and species patents both, is, therefore, clearly unsustainable, in the light of the observations in para 43 of Astrazeneca-I.

37. The insistence, by Astrazeneca, to continue to plead infringement by Intas, of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625 was found to be defeating the case that Astrazeneca was seeking to set up. 

38. Practically, the entire reasoning of the Division Bench of this Court in Astrazeneca-I, therefore, revolves around the fact that Astrazeneca was pleading infringement, by DAPA, of the genus patent IN147 as well as the species patent IN625. This assertion of simultaneous infringement of both the genus and the species patents was found to completely defeat the case of Astrazeneca.  Perhaps, most significantly, in para 43, the Division Bench observed that Astrazeneca might have had a case, had it restricted its claim of infringement to the species patent, rather than claiming infringement of both the genus and the species patents.  

39. In the present case, there is no dispute that Kudos has claimed infringement only of the species patent IN720 and has claimed no infringement of the genus patent IN218. The above observations of the Division Bench in Astrazeneca-I, particularly in conjunction with the manner in which the Division Bench sought to distinguish the judgment of this court in FMC-II, clearly indicates that, in a case where the species patent alone is asserted, and no infringement of the genus patent is pleaded, the decision in FMC-II would continue to hold the field. 

40. In fact, far from Astrazeneca-I overruling FMC-II, or FMC-II being no longer good law after the decision in Astrazeneca-I, my understanding is that, in a case where a species patent alone is asserted, Astrazeneca-I upholds the decision in FMC-II as representing the correct legal position. The decision in Astrazeneca-I having been upheld by the Supreme Court by dismissal of the SLP, in a case where the species patent alone is asserted, the correct legal position would be the position taken by this Court in FMC-II. 

III.	Individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak

41. The individual grounds of challenge raised by Mr. Sai Deepak in the present case are all covered by the earlier decisions of this bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II.  Though appeals may have been preferred against these decisions, I have not been informed of any interlocutory order having been passed, staying their operation.

42. I deem it necessary, therefore, only to allude to the relevant passages from the decisions of this bench in FMC-II, Novartis-I and Novartis-II, which address the issues raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, vis-à-vis the facts which arise in the present case, rather than re-analyze the legal position ab initio.

IV.	The coverage v. disclosure conundrum and the challenge on the ground of obviousness and lack of inventive step  Section 64(1)(f)

43. The aspect of whether coverage and disclosure are the same, or whether coverage implies disclosure, has to be decided on the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Novartis AG, as the Supreme Court has specifically alluded to the point.  Howsoever one may interpret or understand Novartis AG, it is not permissible for any court, lower in the judicial hierarchy to the Supreme Court, to allow its judicial peregrinations to take it outside Novartis AG of that decision, when dealing with the aspect of coverage vis-à-vis disclosure.

44. In FMC-II, this Court has analyzed the decision in Novartis AG threadbare, para by para.  The conclusion that this Court has arrived is contained in paras 81 to 84 of the decision, which may be reproduced thus:
81. 	Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis  have, in my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, which set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, by learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina. Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual controversy before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced were general in nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as contained in paras 118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally omnibus. What was contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as recorded in paras 114 and 116 of the report, was that the scope of coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a patent. This argument stands reiterated, in the same para (para 116) - that coverage that is granted in respect of a patent is not always co-extensive with what is disclosed in the patent. In the light of the Zimmerman invention, learned Senior Counsel contended that the patent may be entitled to larger coverage than what is specifically disclosed in it. The teaching in the patent, it was contended, lay in the disclosure/specification that supports the claim, which describes the invention. Dealing with these submissions, the Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that the dichotomy sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on the one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale of the law of patent. The words in a patent, as used by the Supreme Court, indicated of the intent of the Supreme Court to be expounding the law in general terms, and not limited to the Zimmerman patent, or the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare reading of para 118 of the report in Novartis AG makes it clear that the Supreme Court has expressed its view with respect to patents in general. The opening sentence of para 119 of the report is a proposition couched in absolute terms and, in my respectful opinion, it would be folly, on the part of this Court, to restrict those observations to the facts of Novartis AG.

82. 	According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of repetition), any dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage or claim, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent, struck at the very root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the Supreme Court has disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any dichotomy being sought to be drawn between coverage and disclosure.

83. 	Having said that, etymologically, dichotomy is not the same as distinction. The Supreme Court has not held that coverage and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is no distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its words with precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no dichotomy between coverage and disclosure. Dichotomy is defined, in the Oxford Dictionary, as a division or contrast between two things that are or are being represented as being opposed or entirely different. In holding that there can be no dichotomy between coverage or claim, on the one hand, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the other, the Supreme Court has not, therefore, held that they are identical. Accepting the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require this Court to place, in the first sentence in para 119 of the report in Novartis AG , the word dichotomy with distinction or difference. That, I am afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court has, in disapproving the existence of any wide gap between coverage and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold that the concepts were identical.

84. 	Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus, would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act, which make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to disclosure. Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not envisage the claim or coverage of the claim, to be identical to disclosure. Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held. What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court, by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in the Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore, covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not disclosed by it. Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to holding that there was complete dichotomy between coverage and disclosure, with no connection between the two. It would amount to holding that, while examining what was disclosed in a patent, the authority, or the Court concerned, was to remain oblivious to the coverage of the patent. Such a dichotomy, which would result in a wide gap between coverage and disclosure was, in terms, disapproved by the Supreme Court. If, however, there was clear coverage of a product in the claim (as was found to exist in the Zimmerman Patent, qua Imatinib Mesylate), it would be difficult for the patent holder to assert, before the Court, that, despite such coverage, the claim did not disclose the product. That, in my view, is what Novartis AG holds. It does not pronounce that coverage and disclosure are identical or synonymous terms, in patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai Deepak, to that effect cannot, therefore, be accepted.

45. It cannot, therefore, be said that coverage is the same as disclosure or that, by accepting coverage of the impugned product by the genus patent, the plaintiff also admits disclosure.  

46. A bare glance at the Markush structure claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN218, vis-à-vis the chemical structure of Olaparib as claimed in Claim I of the species patent IN720, makes it apparent that Olaparib cannot be said to have been disclosed in the genus patent.
 
47. Natcos pleadings in this regard are admittedly to be found in paras 89 to 106 of the written statement filed by way of response to the present plaint, which read thus:
89. 	The following submissions are made without prejudice to the foregoing averments as well as subsequently following submissions under other grounds of revocation. 

90. 	It is submitted that the claims of IN720 lack inventive step and/or are obvious in view of the following prior art, when taken independently or in any combination: 

Teachings of WO576

91. 	WO576 discloses the preparation of specific product claimed in IN720. The specific portions of the complete specification of WO576 specifically teaches and also categorically suggests the the specific substitutions in the Markush structure of WO576 which result in Olaparib claimed in IN720. For the purpose of convenience, the specific portions of the complete specification of WO576 are reproduced below: 

WO576 discloses the following compound

wherein

A-B, RN and RC can be optionally substituted.

Substitution of A-B

Page 5 of the complete specification states the second aspect of the present invention wherein

A and B together represent an optionally substituted, fused aromatic ring

At Page 7 of the complete specification describes aromatic ring as follows:

The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclic structure having delocalised n-electron orbitals.

Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:

In one group of preferred embodiments, the aromatic group comprises a single aromatic ring, which has five or six ring atoms,
which ring atoms are selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulphur, and which ring is optionally substituted. Examples of these groups include benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole, thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole.

Substitution of RC

RC is -CH2-RL;

Substitution of RL

RL is optionally substituted phenyl

At Page 19 of the description:

RL is preferably a benzene ring, naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3- benzodioxole, and more preferably a benzene ring

When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The one or
more substituents may be selected from: C1-7 alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20 aryl; C3-20 heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy ester and amido; amino (including sulfonamide), more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino; acylamido including ureido groups, where the acyl or amino substituent is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.

On page 15 of the complete specification preferred substituents of the benzene ring when RL is phenyl is given and includes:

Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C
(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -C(=0)N(CH3)2, - C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and -C(=0)N(CH2CH3)2, as well as amido groups in which R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl.

Substitution of RN

92. 	The specific disclosures in WO576 regarding these particular substitutions provides the teaching, suggestion and motivation and also makes it obvious for a person skilled in the art to reach to the desired product i.e., Olaparib claimed in IN720.

93. 	It is pertinent that there is nothing in IN720 which would show any technical advancement or economic significance over the disclosure of WO576  given the substantial identity of the respective disclosures (as outlined above under prior publication and relied on for purposes of brevity as if reproduced herein).

94. 	Given that the dosages, the modes of formulation and even
the concentration of active in formulation are identical, IN720 is woefully lacking in any material which would show the purported inventive step of the claims that were granted. It is in fact equally pertinent that Olaparib, i.e.,Compound 168 of IN720 actually lacks supporting disclosure to show that it has the same benefits of IC50 values or potentiating growth factor values as the remaining
compounds of that document, let alone better values than the compounds disclosed in WO576. Simply put, IN720 lacks any seed material to support the claim of inventive step over WO576.

95.	 It is therefore submitted that IN720 must be rejected alone on the ground of lack of inventive step and/or obviousness based on WO576 alone.

Teachings of WO 2002/014090

96. 	Yet another prior art on the basis of which IN720 lacks inventive step is WO090. The details of WO090 are as follows:

Title of the Invention
Amino-Phthalazinone Derivatives Active
as Kinase Inhibitors, Process For their
Preparation and Pharmaceutical
Composition Containing them
Date of filing
July 30, 2002
Date of effective filing
July 30, 2002
Date of priority
Aug 07, 2001 (US)
Date of publication
Feb 20, 2003
Name of applicant 
Pharmacia (IT)
	
97. 	The application was published on 20.02.2003 i.e., before the earliest priority dated of IN720 and hence, is prior art for IN720.

98. 	The cited prior art relates to the amino phthalazinone derivatives active as Kinase inhibitors. Page 4 Placitum 16 of WO090 states:

The present invention provides a method for treating diseases caused by and/or associated with an altered protein kinase activity, by administering to a mammal in need thereof an effective amount of an amino-phthalazinone derivative represented by formula (I): 

wherein the relevant teaching is as follows:

Ra and Rb are, each independently, a hydrogen atom or a group,
R2 is a hydrogen atom or it is a group, optionally further substituted m is 0 or an integer from 1 to 3;

R1 is hydrogen or an optionally substituted group selected from
alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heterocyclyl or
heterocyclylalkyl

Page 31 placitum 35 defines arylalkyl group as:

arylalkyl group such as, for instance, the benzyl group, by working
according to conventional methods.	

Page 10 placitum 4 further describes the substitution of benzyl group as:
optionally substituted in any of the free positions by one or more groups, for instance 1 to 6 groups, selected from: halogen, nitro, oxo groups (=0) , carboxy, cyano, alkyl, perfluorinated alkyl, alkenyl alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, a ino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino.

99. The above disclosure of WO090 not only teaches but also suggests the specific substitutions described above. For a person of skill in the art, this also provides the motivation to try and practice the substitutions taught and suggested in  WO090 since the cited document also relates to providing anti-tumour compounds. The difference if any resides in that WO090 suggests and additional substitution of an amino on the benzene ring. There is however, nothing to suggest that the unsubstituted phthalazinone would be ineffective or is not preferred. In any event, even this differential is overcome when WO090 and WO576 are read together  which would provide a phthalazinone derivative without the additional amino substitution on the benzene ring. There is sufficient motivation to read the two documents together since both in essence relate to phthalazinone derivatives and both purportedly provide compounds with anti-tumoral activity. When the teaching of WO090 is read together with the teachings of WO576, there is sufficient, teaching, suggestion and motivation which renders the claims of IN720 and in particular Olaparib obvious for a person of skill in the art. On the above-mentioned ground, IN720 lacks inventive step and is obvious to a person of skill in the art.

Teachings of EP 0289881

100. EP881 relates to 2-aminoalkyl-4-benzyl-1-(2H)- phthalazinone derivatives and was published on 09.11.1988. It is therefore prior art for IN720. EP881 describes compounds which are useful as antiasthmatic, antiallergic, Paf-antagonistic (Paf = platelet activating factor, mediator, which triggers asthma inter alia) and leukotriene-inhibition. The EPO machine-translated copy of EP881 is filed in the proceedings.
Page 1 of EP881 states:
"".a process for preparing basic substituted phthalazinone of the general formula

	

in which R1 represents an aryl or aralkyl radical optionally
substituted in the nucleus, R2 represents a divalent straight or branched aliphatic chain having at least 2 and at most 5 carbon atoms, and R3 and R4 denote low molecular weight alkyl groups which, together with the nitrogen, may be members of a heterocyclic ring, or their salts or quaternary ammonium compounds. For these compounds, a histaminolytic (antihistamine) effect, spasmolytic and local anaesthetic effect is specified.

The radical R1 is preferably in the 4-position of the phenyl ring; occurring C1-C6-alkyl groups, C1-C6-alkoxy groups, alkenyl groups or alkynyl groups can be straight or branched, in particular these radicals consist of 1-4 or, if they are unsaturated, of 3-4 C atoms.

If R3 is an alkenyl or alkynyl group, there is at least one saturated C atom between the unsaturated bond and the nitrogen. The unsaturated bond is preferably in the 2,3-position or 3,4-position. 

The C3-C8-cycloalkyl radical is in particular the cyclopentyl radical or cyclohexyl radical.

If R3 represents a phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical, this may be mono -,di-or trisubstituted by the stated radicals. The alkyl part of this phenylalkyl radical preferably consists of one, two or three C atoms and may optionally also be branched.

The alkylene bridge Alk can be straight or branched and preferably consists of two, three or four C atoms. If this alkylene bridge contains Alk a double bond, it is isolated from the group NR2 R3 if R2 is hydrogen (ie, not conjugated to this group). Preferably, at least one saturated carbon atom is located between such a double bond and the
two nitrogen bonds.

Particularly favourable effects have, for example, those compounds where the radicals R1 to R3, Alk have the following meanings: R1 = fluorine, chlorine or bromine, in particular in the 4-position, preferably fluorine in the 4-position; R2 = C1-C6-alkyl, preferably methyl; R3 = phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl, optionally substituted as indicated. 

The substituents of the phenyl-C1-C6-alkyl radical are preferably C1-C4-alkyl groups (in particular methyl) or a halogen (for example Cl, F) or C1-C4-alkoxy groups (in particular methoxy groups). The substituents in the phenyl part of this phenylalkyl radical are preferably in the 2-position, 3-position, 4-position or 2,4-position. Occurring alkyl, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkanoylamino or alkoxy alkyl groups may be straight or branched.Alkyl or alkoxy radicals preferably consist of 1 to 4 C atoms, the alkanoyl radicals preferably consist of 2 to 4 C atoms.

101. The teachings of EP881 suggest similar structure of phthalazinone derivatives and also suggests towards the substitution of phenyl at R1 which is further substituted with a halo group (one of which is F) as preferred. Hence, if such teachings of EP881 are read with the teachings of WO576 and/or WO090, it clearly suggests and teaches towards what is claimed as an invention IN720, thus rendering claims 1 and 2 of IN720 obvious for a person of skill in the art. Hence, on the basis of the teachings of EP881 read with above cited arts, IN720 is obvious and lacks inventive step.


Teachings of WO 2002/090334

102. 	Another prior art on the basis of which IN720 lacks
inventive step is WO334. The present Patent has also been
filed by the same entity i.e., Kudos Pharmaceuticals and even has at least two common inventors.

103. It is respectfully submitted that, on the basis of specific disclosure in WO334, IN720 lacks inventive step. For the perusal of this Honble court, the specific teachings of WO334 which results in the final product claimed in IN720 is reproduced herein:

The complete specification at page no. 5 reproduces the following compound

	
wherein:

A-B together represent an optionally substituted aromatic ring One of the RC1 and RC2 is -CH2-RL and other of RC1 and RC2 is H RL is optionally substituted Phenyl; and

RN is hydrogen

On page 17 placitum 20 onwards, Further preferences of substitution is discussed as:

It is preferred that only one of RC1 And RC2 is represented by -L-RL, and the other of RC1 and RC2 is H

On Page 17 Placitum 25
The fused aromatic ring(s) represented by -A-B- preferably consist of solely carbon ring and thus may be Benzene, naphthalene and is more preferably Benzene.

On page 17 placitum 31

RN is preferably selected from hydrogen.

On Page 18 placitum 28

RL is preferably C5-20 aryl, and more preferably a benzene ring, naphthalene, pyridine, 1,3-benzodioxole or furan.
When RL is a benzene ring, it is preferably substituted. The one or more substituents may be selected from: C1-7 alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20 aryl, C3-20 heterocyclyl; halo, more preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy, and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and amido; amino (including sulphonamide), more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, and cycloamino groups, such as morpholino;
acylamido, including ureido groups, where the acyl or amino substituents is preferably phenyl, which itself is optionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol; thioether; sulphoxide; sulphone

On Page 14 placitum 8 amido group is explained as:

Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl, aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C (=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limited to, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -C(=0)N(CH3)2, -
C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and -C (=0)N (CH2CH3) 2, as well as amido groups in which R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a heterocyclic structure as in, for example, piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .

104. 	It is respectfully submitted that the only difference that WO334 shows is the specific substitution of Nitrogen (N) at RC2. If the teachings of WO334 are read together with WO576, it makes it obvious for the person skilled in the art to reach Olaparib now claimed in IN720.

105. It is further submitted that such specific disclosure regarding the substitutions and the fact that the application
has been filed by the same applicant and have at least 2 common inventors clearly shows that the product claimed in IN720 was always within the knowledge of Plaintiff 1 and that the filing IN720 was an attempt at protecting an import monopoly and evergreening of patent protection for
Olaparib.

106. On the basis of above disclosures in the above cited prior arts read alone or in combination, it is respectfully submitted that IN720 lacks inventive step and/or is obvious.

48.	A bare reading of the afore-extracted paragraphs from the written statement of Natco indicates that Natco is arriving at chemical structure of Olaparib, in the case of each of the referred prior art inventions, by choosing select radicals out of the several suggested substitutions in the complete specifications of the prior art patents.  There is not a whisper of an averment, in the written statement, to justify such preferential selection.  By way of example, when Natco picks the amido radical out of a choice of carbonyl groups, such as carboxy, ester and amido, or carbylamino and its alkylcarbylamino derivative out of a choice of alkylamino, dialkylamino, arylamino, diarylamino, ureido, alkylureido or arylureido; carbonylamino groups and derivatives thereof such as, for instance, formylamino, alkylcarbonylamino, alkenylcarbonylamino, arylcarbonylamino, alkoxycarbonylamino, the written statement does not indicate why Natco chooses to make that particular choice.  Nor does it contain anything to indicate that the teachings in the suggested prior arts would lead a person skilled in the art to make that particular selection.  The exercise undertaken by Natco is, therefore, clearly an exercise of hindsight reconstruction, armed with prior knowledge of the necessary radicals which are to be substituted onto the Markush Claim I of the genus patent IN218 in order to arrive at claim I of the species patent IN720, by cherry-picking the appropriate radicals for substitution. Such hindsight operation, prima facie, demolishes the plea, of Natco that Claim I in the suit patent is obvious from the genus patent, or, for that reason, that the species patent is vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of want of inventive step, under Section 64(1)(f) of the Patents Act.

49.	Indeed, if Olaparib were so obvious from the suggested prior arts, there is no explanation why it took 19 years, after the genus patent had been granted, for Natco to synthesize Olaparib.  Even as an old patent, which has weathered 19 years of uninfringed existence, therefore, the suit patent is entitled to protection.

V.	Re. allegation of anticipation by prior claiming  Section 64(1)(a)

48.  Section 64(1)(a) has also come up for analyses by this Court in FMC-II, and paras 107 and 109 to 112 of the said decision may in this context be thus reproduced:
107. 	Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of the said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in the complete specification of another patent granted in India. The statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the complete specification of another patent granted in India (for ease of reference, the prior patent). A defendant who seeks to allege invalidity, or vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a), therefore, predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent was valid. An allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to any challenge to the validity of the suit patent under Section 64(1)(a). The defendant in the present case, in asserting vulnerability of IN307 as having been anticipated by prior claiming in Claim 22 of IN978, therefore, has to accede to the validity of Claim 22 of IN978.

*****



109. 	CTPR is the invention claimed in Claim 1 of the complete specification in IN307, i.e. the suit patent. The valid claim of earlier priority date in the prior patent, for the purposes of Section 64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of IN978. Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent vulnerable if CTPR is, prima facie, claimed in Claim 22 of IN978.

110. 	I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is not claimed, or even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN978. Claim 22 of IN978 claims a Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said Markush moiety to Claim 1 in IN307, or to CTPR, only by cherry picking select radicals out of the innumerable choices provided in the complete specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN978, for substitution on said Markush moiety. Save and except for demonstrating how, by substituting such select radicals, it is possible to move from the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN978 to Claim 1 of IN307, or to CTPR, the defendant has, in its written statement, not indicated any teaching or guidance, available in the complete specifications of IN278, as would guide a person skilled in the art to pick the select radicals and substitute them on the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN978, so as to lead him to CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the Markush formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN307, is obvious from the disclosure provided in Claim 22 of IN978.

111. 	The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as is apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written submissions filed by the defendant that Claim 22 of IN978 encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the impugned patent IN307, thereby rendering the entirety of the principal claim of IN 307 vulnerable to revocation. The correctness of this argument of the defendant appears to be somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears to be contrary to the contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words used in Section 13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While advancing this contention, the defendant has introduced two new concepts, which find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of scope and coverage. Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a claim in the suit patent is claimed in any claim of any other complete specification. It does not make any reference either to the scope of the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required therefore, prima facie, is comparison of the claims, not whether the claim in the suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the claim in the genus patent. This position is also conceded by the defendant, in its written submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily, a challenge of anticipation by prior claiming has to be decided on a claim-to-claim comparison. The defendant would seek to contend that, in the present case, this exercise is obviated because of the admission - as the defendant would perceive it - by the plaintiff, in its plaint and replication, of the coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of IN978. No such admission is, as already held here in before, discernible from the paragraphs on which the defendant seeks to place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, even as per the defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine the applicability of Section 64(1)(a) - or, for that matter, Section 13(1)(b) - to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these provisions apply.

112. 	The defendant has made a strained effort to justify invocation of Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if Claim 1 in IN307 includes variants which were outside the scope of Claim 22 in IN978, the former claim was, nonetheless, rendered prima facie vulnerable to the extent it fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN978, i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR. Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor Section 64(1)(a), in my considered opinion, lends itself to such an interpretation. All that these provisions require the Court - or authority before whom the challenge to the validity is raised - to do is to assess whether the invention, insofar as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or was not, claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is not claimed in Claim 22 of IN978. The highest that the defendant can assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an arthropodicidal anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush coverage of Claim 22 of IN978. In the discussion here in before, I have already opined that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot be that CTPR has been claimed in Claim 22 of IN978.

49. As has been correctly contended by Mr. Pravin Anand, a plea of vulnerability of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming can successfully be raised only if the claim in the suit patent has been claimed in a patent of an earlier priority date. There must, therefore, be identity of claims.  Para 16 of the written submissions filed by Mr. Sai Deepak, it is asserted, in this regard, thus:
16.	From the above it is clear that anticipation by prior claiming u/Sec. 64(1)(a) is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product but is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the
complete specification. After all, what the patentee can assert against third parties in the form of a sword must be equally available to the third parties as a shield to defend themselves against the patentees claim of infringement. Any other interpretation of the statutory scheme would defeat the manifest legislative intent and that too in a critical realm such as the pharmaceutical industry. The concept of enabling disclosure may at
best be applicable with respect to the ground of anticipation by prior publication, but not in the context of anticipation by prior claiming since Sec. 64(1)(a) is meant to act as a fetter on the patentees ability to evergreen its right to sue based on the claim and is therefore not contingent on the scope or specificity of the disclosure. Therefore, to apply the test of enabling disclosure in the context of 64(1)(a) is to foist on it one of the possible standards which may be applicable to Sec. 64(1)(e).

50. The assertions in the afore-extracted passage from the written submissions of Mr. Sai Deepak, in my view, is based on a fundamentally erroneous legal premise. 

51. Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend that a claim of vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming is dependent on reasonable construction of the claim to assess the scope of its coverage in respect of a product, but is in no way contingent on specific disclosure of the product in the complete specification.  It is further sought to be contended that specificity of disclosure may be a relevant test for Section 64(1)(e), but cannot be regarded as a relevant test for Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act.

52. The view expressed by me in FMC-II, as already extracted hereinabove, compels me to disagree with Mr. Sai Deepaks submissions.  In my view, Section 64(1)(a) is clear and categorical in the words it uses.  It states that the invention, so far as claimed in the suit patent, has to have been claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date for the suit patent to be regarded as vulnerable to invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming.  There has, therefore, to be identity of claims.  The claim asserted in the suit patent, must have been claimed in a complete specification relating to a patent of earlier priority date.  Then, and only then, can a plea of invalidity on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming be successfully laid.

53. A claim is even more specific than a disclosure.  On a plain claim to claim comparison, it is clear that Olaparib, as Claim I in the suit patent IN720, has never been claimed in any earlier patent to which Mr. Sai Deepak draws attention.  The Markush structure claimed in Claim I of the genus patent IN218 certainly cannot be said to claim Claim I in the suit patent IN720.  As such, no prima facie case of anticipation by prior claiming can be said to exist.

Reliance on Form 27s, PTE applications by Kudos in Australia and Korea and Eurasian patent EU 006300 and Russian patent RU 2755865

54. Mr. Sai Deepak has sought to place reliance on the Forms 27 filed by Kudos in respect of IN720 and IN218, the PTE applications filed by Kudos in Australia and Korea and the identity of the Eurasian and Russian equivalents of alleged identity of the claims in Russian patent RU865 with the claims in IN720.

55. I do not see how this Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC, can delve into such depth of detail.  It is true, this Court has, in earlier decisions, done so.  However, in view of the note of caution sounded by the Supreme Court in Pernod Ricard, I am of the opinion that some kind of rethink is necessary on this aspect.  There is no denying the fact that orders on applications filed in pharma patent cases for interim relief often go into such depth of details that practically nothing remains for adjudication in the suit.  This may not be an acceptable way of proceeding.

56. Particularly when dealing with a challenge to the validity of the suit patent on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, once the Court finds, on facts, by claim to claim comparison, that there is no anticipation by prior claiming, statements made in other jurisdictions, or in documents filed by the plaintiffs elsewhere, cannot make out a case of anticipation by prior claiming, even at the prima facie stage.  ought not to legitimately form part of the consideration.  The plaintiffs would have, during the course of trial, every opportunity to explain the circumstances in which such statements were made, and before grant of such opportunity, where a prima facie clear case of lack of anticipation of prior claiming is made out, the matter must rest there, when dealing with an Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications.  

57. I have nonetheless reproduced, in this regard, the defence raised by Mr. Anand to the various points raised by Mr. Sai Deepak, and for the purposes of adjudicating the present Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 applications, suffice it to state that the challenges have not been left unanswered.  The response by Mr. Praveen Anand raises, at the very least, triable issues.  When, on a claim to claim comparison, no case of anticipation of prior claiming is found to exist, it cannot be said that the defendant has raised a credible challenge on that ground.

VI.	Re. Anticipation by prior publication  Section 64(1)(e) 

58. Anticipation by prior publication has also been dealt with, by this Bench, in its decisions in FMC-II and Novartis I.  Paras 117 to 118, 124 to 128 and 133 of FMC-II and para 222 of Novartis I may, in this context, be reproduced thus:
From FMC-II

117. 	Section 64(1)(e) states where the invention, so far as claimed in the suit patent, is not new, having regard to either (i) what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent or (ii) what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Unlike Section 64(1)(a), therefore, which is a self-contained provision, Section 64(1)(e) refers us back to Section 13. Sub-sections (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13 are relevant, and maybe reproduced thus:
13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim -
(1) 	The examiner to whom an application for a patent is referred under section 12 shall make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification -
(a) 	has been anticipated by publication before the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and dated on or after the 1st day of January, 1912;
*****
(2) 	The examiner shall, in addition, make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining, whether the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, has been anticipated by publication in India or elsewhere in any document other than those mentioned in subsection (1) before the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification.

118. 	Whether under clause (1)(a) or (2), what Section 13 requires is publication of the invention, claimed in the suit patent, in any document, before the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit patent.
      xxxxx
124. 	Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new. This necessarily refers us back to the definition of new invention in clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning any invention or technology which has not been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the country or elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of patent application with complete specification, i.e., the subject matter has not fallen in public domain or that it does not form part of the state of the art. Anticipation, when used in the Patents Act, has its own peculiar legal connotation. Though anticipation, per se, is not separately defined, Section 13 provides for anticipation only by prior publication or by prior claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability of a patent to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior publication. In order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute the basis for revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary that, consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer new; which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its character as a new invention, by reason of anticipation by prior publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a new invention. This is counterbalanced by the definition of new invention, which envisages absence of novelty either on account of anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in the present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior use of the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case having been pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss of novelty on the ground of anticipation by prior publication.

125. 	Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly - and significantly - worded. The words before the priority date of the claim succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words what was publicly known or publicly used in India. No such caveat as to time follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated, in Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit patent. The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit patent, does not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the manner in which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the legislature.

126. 	That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of prior publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e), is completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem. What, then, is the terminus ad quem, for the purposes of prior publication under Section 64(1)(e)? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to provide a terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with the prior publication, apparently because this part of the clause is to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which provides the appropriate terminus ad quem, in clauses (1)(a) and (2), which have already been reproduced hereinabove, and which envisage anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad quem provided in respect of anticipation by prior publication, in clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13, is the date of filing of the applicant's complete specification, and not the priority date of the suit patent. The priority date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima facie irrelevant for the purposes of vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with Section 13 of the Patents Act. What has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification in the suit patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in the present case, was published in India or elsewhere in any document.

127. 	Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an invention without disclosure of the invention in the patent?

128. 	Publication involves making known to the public the patent application. Every application is required to disclose the invention for which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents Act4 (already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in the complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention, its operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, but also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to be able to successfully allege that CTPR was published in US424 and US357 (being the US equivalent of EP508), the defendant would have to establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents.
      xxxxx
133. 	Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR. Besides, they are pharmaceutical patents, relating to pharmaceutical products for therapeutic administration. There is also substance in Mr. Sethi's contention that these are also Markush claims, and cannot, therefore, be said to teach synthesising of CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to convince myself that CTPR stands claimed, or disclosed, in these patents. Sans any claim or disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that CTPR was published either in US424 or US357 (or, therefore, in EP508).

      From Novartis-I
      
222. 	Section 64(1)(e) envisages, as a ground for revocation of a patent, that the invention so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new, having regard to what was publicly known or publicly used in India before the priority date of the claim or to what was published in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. The plea of vulnerability of the suit patent IN 161 on the ground of anticipation by prior publication, as advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak, is predicated on the latter half of this Clause. Section 64(1)(e) refers back to Section 13. Anticipation by publication finds reference in Clauses (1)(a) and (2) of Section 13. Section 13(1)(a) refers to anticipation by publication of the applicant's complete specifications in any specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and does not, therefore, apply to the ground taken by Mr. Sai Deepak. Section 13(2) refers to anticipation by publication of the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, by publication in India or elsewhere in any document before the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit patent. The use of the expression so far as claimed, in Section 13(2) would, therefore, require identity in the extent of claim contained in the specification in the suit patent and in the specification of the prior art which is cited for the purpose of alleging anticipation by prior publication.

59. In para 126 of FMC-II, this Bench has clearly rejected Mr. Sai Deepaks contention that the terminus ad quem for determining anticipation by prior publication is the priority date of the suit patent.   It is held, in the said para, that the priority date of the suit patent is prima facie irrelevant, while examining vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior publication and that, when Section 64(1)(e) is read with Section 13 of the Patents Act, what has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the complete specification of the suit patent, the asserted invention was published in India or elsewhere in any document.

60. Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the genus patent WO 2002/36576 (WO576), equivalent to IN218 to contend that Claim 1 in the suit patent, i.e. Olaparib, stands anticipated by prior publication in WO576.  He relies, for this purpose, on Compound 278 in WO576, and the process of its synthesis as reflected in the complete specifications in WO576. 


61. It is obvious at a bare glance that the product compound 278 is not Olaparib. 

62. Para 83 of the written statement sets out, in a tabular fashion, the manner in which WO576 allegedly anticipates, by prior publication, Olaparib:
WO576
IN720
WO576 discloses the following
Compound




wherein A-B, RN and RC can be
optionally substituted.
Page 4 of the description states the second aspect of the present invention wherein A and B together represent an optionallysubstituted, fused aromatic ringRC is -CH2-RL;
RL is optionally substituted phenyl; and
RN is hydrogen.

Substitution of A-B
Page 6 of the complete specification
describes aromatic ring as follows:
The term ""aromatic ring"" is used herein
in the conventional sense to refer to a
cyclic aromatic structure, that is, a cyclicstructure having delocalised n-electronorbitals.
Page 7 and Page 8 of the description:
In one group of preferred embodiments,
the aromatic group comprises a single
aromatic ring, which has five or six ringatoms, which ring atoms are selectedfrom carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, andsulphur, and which ring is optionallysubstituted. Examples of these groupsinclude benzene, pyrazine, pyrrole,thiazole, isoxazole, and oxazole.
IN720 claims the following
Compound


















Compound at the place of A-B (in  IN218) enclosed above shows an aromatic ring i.e., Benzene

Substitution of RL
Page 18 of the description doc:
RL is preferably a benzene ring,
naphthalene, pyridine or 1,3-
benzodioxole, and more preferably a
benzene ringWhen RL is a benzene ring, it ispreferably substituted. The one or moresubstituents may be selected from: C1-7alkyl, more preferably methyl, CF3; C5-20aryl; C3-20heterocyclyl; halo, more
preferably fluoro; hydroxy; ether, more
preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy,and cyclopentoxy; nitro; cyano; carbonylgroups, such as carboxy, ester andamido; amino (including sulfonamide),more preferably -NH2, -NHPh, andcycloamino groups, such as morpholino;acylamido including ureido groupswhere the acyl or amino substituent ispreferably phenyl, which itself isoptionally fluorinated; acyloxy; thiol;thioether; sulfoxide; sulfone.





Compound at the place of RC (inIN218) shows substitution of RLwhereinRL is selected from amido group andoptionally further substituted withFluorine (F)

On page 15 of the description Preferred substituents of the benzene ring, when RLis phenyl is given, which includes:
Amido (carbamoyl, carbamyl,aminocarbonyl, carboxamide) : -C(=0)NR1R2, wherein R1 and R2 are independently amino substituents, as defined for amino groups. Examples of amido groups include, but are not limitedto, -C(=0)NH2, -C(=0)NHCH3, -
C(=0)N(CH3)2, -C(=0) NHCH2CH3, and-C (=0)N (CH2CH3) 2, as well as amidogroups in which R1 and R2, togetherwith the nitrogen atom to which theyare attached, form a heterocyclicstructure as in, for example,piperidinocarbonyl, morpholinocarbonyl, thiomorpholinocarbonyl, and piperazinocarbonyl .

Substitution of RN
RN is hydrogen.


The substitution at the place of RN (in IN218) is Hydrogen (H) as stated in the claim of IN218


63. It is clear, from a bare glance at the manner in which Natco has arrived at the chemical structure of Olaparib from Claim I in WO576 that there has been cherry picking of substituents.  For example, 
(i) in the A-B radical in the WO576 claim, there is no explanation for why the example of benzene has been selected out of the possible substituents of 5- to 6- membered aromatic rings, out of 
(a) benzene, 
(b) pyrazine, 
(c) pyrrole, 
(d) thiazole, 
(e) isoxazole and 
(f) oxazole, 
which, too, are merely mentioned as examples, and
(ii) in the -CH2-RL substitution, while the description of WO576 does state that RL, if a benzene ring, is preferably substituted, there is no explanation for why the halo and carbonyl substituents should be selected in preference to 
(a) C1-7 alkyl (more preferably methyl), 
(b) CF3,
(c) C5-20 aryl,
(d) C3-20 heterocyclyl,
(e) hydroxy,
(f) ether (more preferably methoxy, phenoxy, benzyloxy and cyclopentyloxy),
(g) nitro, and
(h) cyano,
among others.  Most significantly, perhaps, there is no teaching, in any of the cited prior arts, to lead a person skilled in the art to envision the terminal  cyclopropane substitution.  

64. No other prior publication, which publishes Olaparib, has been cited by Mr. Sai Deepak either during oral arguments or in written submissions. 

65. No case for anticipation by prior publication is also, therefore, made out.  

VII.	Section 3(d)29

66. Mr. Sai Deepak has also sought to invoke Section 3(d) of the Patents Act to contend that the specifications for Olaparib do not contain any data to indicate enhanced efficacy over the prior art IN218.  

67. The fallacy of the submission is obvious.  Section 3(d), to the extent it is at all relevant to the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, applies only to new forms of known substances.   It cannot be said that Olaparib is a new form of the Markush Claim I in IN720.  The submission, therefore, merits prima facie rejection.

VIII.	Section 64(1)(m) read with Section 830

68. On the ground that, while applying for and obtaining the suit patent, Kudos did not disclose the fact that its applications for grant of the same patent JP 2006-505955 and JP 2007-226723 were facing rejection.  This, in my opinion, cannot be a basis, in any case, for Kudos to be regarded as disentitled to an injunction.  At the very least, the matter would be a question of fact, to be decided on the facts of each individual case.  

69. Besides, Section 8 requires the patent applicant in India, who is prosecuting an application for a patent in another country outside India in respect of the same invention, to file, along with his application, a statement setting out the particulars of the application.  The issue of whether, in a case where the patent is registered, or being prosecuted, in several other jurisdictions, the omission to mention the proceedings before one jurisdiction would invalidate the granted patent altogether is, in my prima facie view, highly arguable.  Even more arguable would be the question of whether, if the omission is bona fide, the patentee, whose patent is admittedly infringed, can be refused an interim injunction.  

70. In the present case, Kudos has placed, on record, documents, including correspondences with its patent agent, which, according to it, indicate that the omission to mention the Japanese patents was not deliberate, but was an inadvertent omission on the part of the patent agent.  How far this argument would be acceptable is, in my view, a matter which would have to await trial.  In any event, in view of the explanation, this cannot be regarded as so overwhelming a factor as would justify rejection of the interim relief that Kudos seeks.

IX.	The sequitur

71. As already noted towards beginning of this judgment, several incidental contentions were raised, including IC 50 values, dosage data, anti-cancer PARP inhibition data, and the like, all of which would require a detailed excursion into facts.  It would not be justified for this Court to enter into all these areas, once a prima facie case has been found to exist in favour of the plaintiff.  For the purposes of the present application, it is admitted, in the first place, that the defendant is in fact exploiting the suit patent by manufacturing and selling Olaparib.    It is also admitted that this exploitation has take place in the 19th year of the life of the suit patent.  No credible case of vulnerability of the suit patent to invalidity on any of the grounds contained in Section 64 of the Patents Act can be said to have been made out by the Natco.  As no credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent has been made out, the prayer for interlocutory injunction has necessarily to be granted.

Conclusion

72. For all the aforesaid reasons, the present application succeeds and is allowed.  The defendant shall stand restrained from manufacturing and selling, or in any manner, dealing with Olaparib, either under the brand name BRACANAT or under other brand name, pending disposal of the present suit, so long as the suit patent continues to remain alive and subsisting.
  
73. I.A. 907/2023 is allowed accordingly.

IA 153/2023 in CO (Comm. IPD-PAT) 1/2023

74. By this application, Natco seeks an interlocutory injunction staying the operation of the suit patent and restraining Kudos from seeking any injunction against Natco exploiting the suit patent.

75. No separate submissions have been advanced in this application.  In any event, the outcome of I.A 907/2023 in CS (Comm) 29/2023 would necessarily also determine the outcome of the present applications.

76. Resultantly, I.A. 153/2023 is dismissed.

                                                                          C.HARI SHANKAR, J

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE C.HARI SHANKAR
JUDGMENT (ORAL)
% 01.03.2024
W.P.(C) 3112/2024
1. Female students, who desired to undertake the XII class
examination of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as
private candidates have, as per Clause (p)(1) of Serial No.7 of Public
Notice dated 5 September 2023 issued by the CBSE titled “Features of
the Online System of Registration”, applicable to female private
candidates who desired to attempt the examination, to upload, alongW.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 2 of 12with the online application form, a Domicile Certificate issued by the
appropriate authority. The clause reads thus:
“7. Female Students who are bonafide residents of the
National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT of Delhi). This
scheme is available only for examination 2024. Thereafter, this
scheme will be discontinued.
Features of the Online System of Registration
……
Clause (p) (1): Female students who are bonafide residents of the
National Capital Territory of Delhi and have attained the age for
appearing in Class X shall upload the copy of the Domicile
Certificate issued by the appropriate authority when
submitting online application form .
(Emphasis supplied)”
2. Undisputably, in the present case, the petitioner uploaded her
application for permission to sit in the XII class examination as a
private female candidate but did not upload, with the application form,
the requisite Domicile Certificate. Indeed, by that date, the Domicile
Certificate was not even available with the petitioner.
3. Even in the absence of a Domicile Certificate, an admit card
was issued to the petitioner by the CBSE on 6 February 2024. Mr.
Khanna submits that this is one of the drawbacks of the online admit
card generation system of the CBSE, regarding which attempts are
being made by the CBSE to rectify it. In fact, as the petitioner had not
uploaded the Domicile Certificate with her application to attempt the
examination, she was not entitled to be issued an admit card.
4. After issuance of the admit card, as per the averments in the
petition, the petitioner applied for a Domicile Certificate on 10
February 2024, which was issued to her on 16 February 2024.W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 3 of 125. On 19 February 2024 and 22 February 2024, when the
petitioner visited the exam hall to take the papers, she was denied
entrance. It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has
approached this Court by means of the present petition.
6. I had, on 16 February 2024, dealt with two writ petitions
involving similar issues. One ( Vishakha and Anr. v. The Controller
of Examination, CBSE1) involved 21 private female students. The
second, Priyanka Darshi v. CBSE2involved one female private
student. In both cases, the students were not in possession of
Domicile Certificates when they uploaded their application forms for
appearing in their Class XII examinations. In Priyanka Darshi , the
situation was similar to one which obtains in the present case as, after
the admit card was issued, the student applied for and obtained a
Domicile Certificate.
7. I had voiced the opinion that, if the Domicile Certificate was
not even obtained prior to the issuance of the Admit Card, it was not
possible to permit the student to appear in the examination, lest the
requirement of uploading of the Domicile Certificate be not reduced to
a redundancy.
8. That decision in Vishakha was carried in appeal by the students
to the Division Bench of this Court by way of LPA 149/2024
(Vishakha and Anr. v. Controller of Examination, CBSE and Ors. ).
By judgment dated 22 February 2024, the Division Bench has
12024 SCC OnLine Del 1087
22024 SCC OnLine Del 1087W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 4 of 12dismissed the appeal and upheld the view taken by me in the
corresponding writ petitions. Paras 4 to 12 of the decision of the
Division Bench merit reproduction thus:
“4. Learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition
has returned the following findings:
“4. Learned counsel for the petitioners do not
dispute that, as required by the Notification dated 5
September 2023, no copy of the domicile certificate
issued by the appropriate authority was uploaded by
them when they submitted their application online for
appearance in the Class X Board examinations. In fact,
they submit that, even as on date, they are not in a
possession of the domicile certificate and have only
applied to the Competent Authority for issuance
thereof.
5. Though learned counsel for the petitioner have
made fervent pleas calling on the Court to exercise
mercy keeping in mind the fact that the petitioners are
young children, who have to undergo their Class X and
Class XII Board examinations, it is a settled that,
while mercy can, and must, temper justice, it cannot
substitute it. Ubi jus, as the adage goes, ibi
remedium. Availability of a remedy depends on the
existence of a right. The Court cannot pass merely
to show mercy, where the necessary indicia for
grant of relief are not fulfilled .
6. As far back as on 5 September 2023, the notice
issued by the CBSE made it clear that female students
who wanted to apply for attempting Class X and XII
Board examinations, as private candidates, were
required to upload their domicile certificates. There is
no dispute that this has not been done .
7. If this Court were to grant the relief sought
by the petitioners it would render Condition 1 in
Clause (p) of the Notice dated 5 September 2023
completely redundant . It would also set a precedent
where students, without complying with said clause,
can nonetheless come to the Court at the eleventh hour
and obtain orders allowing them to participate in the
examination.W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 5 of 128. It is true that every statutory requirement, which
is facially mandatory, may not always be so.
Procedural statutory requirements, even if
conditioned by the use of the word “shall”, are often
treated as directory. In the present case, however,
the CBSE deals with lakhs – or maybe more – of
applications. Procedural requirements, and the
stipulations regarding the documents and details
which are to accompany an application are not,
therefore, dispensable, more so when the submission
of applications is online, and there is little scope for
physical verification. If Courts start benevolently
granting relief even in cases where there is no strict
compliance with these requirements, it can throw
the system into anarchy. Save in rare cases,
therefore, the Court should not treat such
stipulations as dispensable, in pursuit of what it may
feel is “substantial justice ”.
9. While the Court, therefore, sincerely regrets
being unable to come to the aid of the petitioners, that
is unfortunately what the law ordains. 10. For the
aforesaid reason, it is not possible to grant the relief
sought in this writ petition. The writ petition is
accordingly dismissed in limine.”

5. In this regard, we may note that the ‘Domicile
Certificate’ is issued by Government of NCT of Delhi to an
individual, who is residing continuously for the last three
years within the territorial jurisdiction of NCT of Delhi.
6. The Appellants have relied upon their Aadhaar to
substitute the requirement of the domicile certificate. In this
regard, we may refer to Section 9 of the Aadhaar (Targeted
Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and
Services) Act, 2016 (‘Aadhaar Act’), wherein, it is
specifically stated that the Aadhaar is not a proof of domicile.
Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act reads as under:
“9. Aadhaar number not evidence of
citizenship or domicile, etc .—The Aadhaar number
or the authentication thereof shall not , by itself,
confer any right of, or be proof of, citizenship or
domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder .”
(Emphasis supplied)W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 6 of 127. In view of the said provision in the Aadhaar Act, the
stipulation in the Notice dated 5th September, 2023 requiring
the applicant to file a domicile certificate issued by the
competent authority is reasonable and justified.
8. The exception carved out for private female students
by the Notice dated 5th September, 2023 is a privilege
extended only to the bona fide residents of NCT of Delhi. To
avail the said privilege, the requirement to satisfy the
domicile in NCT of Delhi is an essential condition. Further to
establish such a domicile, the Notice categorically notified
the applicant that he/she must submit a domicile certificate
with the application form. The law is well settled that a
person, who claims benefit of an exception, has to strictly
comply with the conditions for availing the said exception. It
is well settled that exemptions and notifications have to be
construed strictly. The Supreme Court in CCE v. Hari
Chand Shri Gopal3has held as under:
“Exemption clause — Strict construction
29. The law is well settled that a person who claims
exemption or concession has to establish that he is
entitled to that exemption or concession. A provision
providing for an exemption, concession or exception ,
as the case may be, has to be construed strictly with
certain exceptions depending upon the settings on
which the provision has been placed in the statute and
the object and purpose to be achieved. If exemption
is available on complying with certain conditions,
the conditions have to be complied with. The
mandatory requirements of those conditions must be
obeyed or fulfilled exactly, though at times, some
latitude can be shown, if there is a failure to comply
with some requirements which are directory in nature,
the non-compliance of which would not affect the
essence or substance of the notification granting
exemption……..
31. Of course, some of the provisions of an
exemption notification may be directory in nature and
some are mandatory in nature. A distinction between
the provisions of a statute which are of substantive
character and were built in with certain specific
objectives of policy, on the one hand, and those which
3(2011) 1 SCC 236W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 7 of 12are merely procedural and technical in their nature, on
the other, must be kept clearly distinguished. In Tisco
Ltd. [(2005) 4 SCC 272] this Court held that the
principles as regard construction of an exemption
notification are no longer res integra; whereas the
eligibility clause in relation to an exemption
notification is given strict meaning wherefor the
notification has to be interpreted in terms of its
language, once an assessee satisfies the eligibility
clause, the exemption clause therein may be
construed literally . An eligibility criterion, therefore,
deserves a strict construction, although construction
of a condition thereof may be given a liberal meaning
if the same is directory in nature.”
(Emphasis supplied)
9. The Appellants have failed to file the domicile
certificate and they cannot seek waiver of the said condition
in the writ proceedings. The proof of domicile is an essential
condition for proving that the appellants fall in the excepted
category covered by the Notice.
10. Similarly, the Supreme Court in Shikhar and Anr. v.
National Board of Examination & Ors.4has repeatedly
reiterated that power of judicial review in matter concerning
academic policies, which includes setting down of eligibility
criteria for writing examinations, should be exercised with
care and circumspection. The endeavor to mitigate the
hardship of the petitioning persons should not result in
unintended consequences adversely affecting the ongoing
process of examination. The relevant paragraphs of the
judgment read as under:
“9. While we understand that the present cut-off
date for the completion of the internship would put
certain students at a disadvantage, we are conscious
that it is the domain of the executive and regulatory
authorities to formulate appropriate eligibility standards
for admission. In Indian Institute of Technology
Kharagpur v. Soutrik Sarangi, a three-judge Bench of
this Court held that courts should be circumspect in
exercising their powers of judicial review in matters
concerning academic policies, including admission
criteria. In that case, this Court refused to interfere with
the eligibility criteria for appearing in JEE (Advanced)
42022 SCC OnLine SC 425W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 8 of 122021 which prevented a candidate who had secured a
seat in one of the IITs from competing in a subsequent
examination. This Court relied on All India Council for
Technical Education v. Surinder Kumar Dhawan,
where it was observed that judicial interference
motivated by concerns of mitigating the hardship
faced by students may result in unintended
consequences adversely affecting the education
system . This Court held thus:
""19. The reasoning of the High Court of
Criterion 5 not permitting IIT students to
participate in IIT (Advanced) for the second
time being arbitrary, in the opinion of this
Court is not supportable. This Court has
repeatedly emphasized that in matters such as
devising admissions criteria or other issues
engaging academic institutions, the courts'
scrutiny in judicial review has to be careful
and circumspect. Unless shown to be plainly
arbitrary or discriminatory, the court would
defer to the wisdom of administrators in
academic institutions who might devise
policies in regard to curricular admission
process, career progression of their employees,
matters of discipline or other general
administrative issues concerning the institution
or university. It was held by this court in All
India Council for Technical Education v.
Surinder Kumar Dhawan.
""16. The courts are neither equipped
nor have the academic or technical
background to substitute themselves
in place of statutory professional
technical bodies and take decisions in
academic matters involving standards
and quality of technical education. If
the courts start entertaining
petitions from individual
institutions or students to permit
courses of their choice, either for
their convenience or to alleviate
hardship or to provide better
opportunities, or because they
think that one course is equal to
another, without realizing theW.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 9 of 12repercussions on the field of
technical education in general, it
will lead to chaos in education and
deterioration in standards of
education. ""
20. Given this general reluctance of courts
to substitute the views of academic and expert
bodies, the approach of the High Court in
proceeding straightaway to characterize the
rationale given by the IIT in fashioning the
Criteria No. 5 cannot be supported.”
(emphasis supplied)
…….
11. Whenever a cut-off is extended, some students
are likely to fall on the other side of the dividing line.
In State of Bihar v. Ramjee Prasad, the State had
prescribed that applicants applying for the post of
Assistant Professors must have three years of
experience. In the preceding year, the cut-off date for
the receipt of applications was set in June, however,
in the year in question, the date was fixed in January
making certain candidates ineligible owing to their
failure to meet the three-year requirement. This Court
held that the cut-off date cannot be held to be arbitrary
unless it is shown that it is unreasonable, capricious or
whimsical even if no reasons are forthcoming as to
the choice of date.”
(Emphasis supplied)
12. The learned counsel for the Respondents has argued
that the relief sought for in the present appeal if granted will
cause disruption in the ongoing process of Class X and Class
XII Board Examinations of 2024 being held by CBSE. The
Respondents have stated it is neigh impossible to integrate
the Appellants at this advanced stage of examination and in
addition it will cause discrimination to the other similarly
placed applicants, who have not approached the Court.”
(All emphasis in original)
9. Mr. Sahil Mongia, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to
distinguish the decision of the Division Bench by reference to paras
1.5 and 1.6 thereof, which read thus:W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 10 of 12“1.5. The Appellants submitted their respective online
application(s) without the Domicile Certificate. It is stated
that the Appellants uploaded their Aadhar Cards with the
application form. The Appellants have placed on record the
confirmation issued on the Web Portal with following
application numbers to the Appellants: (i) Vishakha i.e.,
Appellant No.1 was allotted WW200040; dated 15th
September, 2023 (ii) Priya Das i.e., Appellant No.2 was
allotted DW100022; dated 29th September, 2023.
1.6. The exams were scheduled to begin on 19th February
2023. However, since the Appellants were not issued their
admit card(s) and therefore the Appellants on 12th
February,2024 approached the Regional Office of the
Respondents at Patparganj, Delhi. The Regional Office
referred the Appellants to the Head Office. Subsequently, on
15th February2024 the Appellants were informed by the
Respondents that no admit card(s) would be issued to them as
they failed to submit the ‘Domicile Certificate’ as per Clause
(p)(1) of the notice dated 05.09.2023.”
10. Thus, according to Mr. Sahil Mongia, the present case is
different from the case of the student appellants in Vishakha . The
appellants in Vishakha , he submits, were students who had not even
been issued admit cards, whereas his client has been issued an admit
card. These two cases, he submits cannot be treated at par, and the
fact that his client has been issued an admit card merits her case being
treated differently from the case of the appellants before the Division
Bench. He further submits that, in the case of Vishakha , the appellant
had also sought replacement of requirement of the Domicile
Certificate by the Aadhar Card.
11. These distinctions of fact, cannot, in my opinion, detract from
the applicability of the position of law enunciated by the Division
Bench in its aforesaid extracted passages from its judgment in
Vishakha . As I have already observed in my decision in PriyankaW.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 11 of 12Darshi , a student, who is erroneously issued an admit card, despite not
having uploaded the Domicile certificate and not even having applied
for a domicile certificate till then, cannot be placed on a better
pedestal than a student who had never been issued an admit card. The
erroneous issuance of an admit card to the former cannot give her a
leg up over the latter.
12. That apart, the principles of law contained in paras 4 to 12 of
the decision of the Division Bench in Vishakha would apply to all
students who were not in possession of Domicile Certificate at least
on the date when the admit cards were issued. Their applicability
cannot depend on whether the students were actually issued admit
cards or were not issued the admit cards. The question is of their
entitlement to be issued admit cards. The Division Bench has held
that they were not so entitled. If there is no entitlement, the fact of
issuance of admit cards cannot confer any special equities in favour of
the students.
13. The ancillary plea advanced by the appellants in Vishakha for
replacement the requirement of Domicile Certificate with the Aadhar
card is obviously completely tangential to the issue at hand.
14. In view of the judgment of Division Bench in Vishakha , it is
not possible to grant the relief that the petitioner seeks.
15. This writ petition is accordingly dismissed in limine .
CM APPL. 12783/2024 and CM APPL. 12784/2024W.P.(C) 3112/2024 Page 12 of 1216. These applications do not survive for consideration and stand
disposed of.

				JUDGMENT (ORAL)
%				         01.03.2024
	
W.P.(C) 3112/2024

1. Female students, who desired to undertake the XII class examination of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as private candidates have, as per Clause (p)(1) of Serial No.7 of Public Notice dated 5 September 2023 issued by the CBSE titled Features of the Online System of Registration, applicable to female private candidates who desired to attempt the examination, to upload, along with the online application form, a Domicile Certificate issued by the appropriate authority. The clause reads thus:
7. 	Female Students who are bonafide residents of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT of Delhi). This scheme is available only for examination 2024. Thereafter, this scheme will be discontinued. 

Features of the Online System of Registration 
 
Clause (p) (1): Female students who are bonafide residents of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and have attained the age for appearing in Class X shall upload the copy of the Domicile Certificate issued by the appropriate authority when submitting online application form.
 (Emphasis supplied)

2. Undisputably, in the present case, the petitioner uploaded her application for permission to sit in the XII class examination as a private female candidate but did not upload, with the application form, the requisite Domicile Certificate.  Indeed, by that date, the Domicile Certificate was not even available with the petitioner. 
3. Even in the absence of a Domicile Certificate, an admit card was issued to the petitioner by the CBSE on 6 February 2024.  Mr. Khanna submits that this is one of the drawbacks of the online admit card generation system of the CBSE, regarding which attempts are being made by the CBSE to rectify it.  In fact, as the petitioner had not uploaded the Domicile Certificate with her application to attempt the examination, she was not entitled to be issued an admit card.
4. After issuance of the admit card, as per the averments in the petition, the petitioner applied for a Domicile Certificate on 10 February 2024, which was issued to her on 16 February 2024. 
5. On 19 February 2024 and 22 February 2024, when the petitioner visited the exam hall to take the papers, she was denied entrance.  It is in these circumstances that the petitioner has approached this Court by means of the present petition.
6. I had, on 16 February 2024, dealt with two writ petitions involving similar issues. One (Vishakha and Anr. v. The Controller of Examination, CBSE1) involved 21 private female students.  The second, Priyanka Darshi v. CBSE2 involved one female private student.  In both cases, the students were not in possession of Domicile Certificates when they uploaded their application forms for appearing in their Class XII examinations.  In Priyanka Darshi, the situation was similar to one which obtains in the present case as, after the admit card was issued, the student applied for and obtained a Domicile Certificate.
7. I had voiced the opinion that, if the Domicile Certificate was not even obtained prior to the issuance of the Admit Card, it was not possible to permit the student to appear in the examination, lest the requirement of uploading of the Domicile Certificate be not reduced to a redundancy.  
8. That decision in Vishakha was carried in appeal by the students to the Division Bench of this Court by way of LPA 149/2024 (Vishakha and Anr. v. Controller of Examination, CBSE and Ors.).  By judgment dated 22 February 2024, the Division Bench has dismissed the appeal and upheld the view taken by me in the corresponding writ petitions.  Paras 4 to 12 of the decision of the Division Bench merit reproduction thus:
4. 	Learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition has returned the following findings: 

4. 	Learned counsel for the petitioners do not dispute that, as required by the Notification dated 5 September 2023, no copy of the domicile certificate issued by the appropriate authority was uploaded by them when they submitted their application online for appearance in the Class X Board examinations. In fact, they submit that, even as on date, they are not in a possession of the domicile certificate and have only applied to the Competent Authority for issuance thereof. 

5. 	Though learned counsel for the petitioner have made fervent pleas calling on the Court to exercise mercy keeping in mind the fact that the petitioners are young children, who have to undergo their Class X and Class XII Board examinations, it is a settled that, while mercy can, and must, temper justice, it cannot substitute it. Ubi jus, as the adage goes, ibi remedium. Availability of a remedy depends on the existence of a right. The Court cannot pass merely to show mercy, where the necessary indicia for grant of relief are not fulfilled.

6. 	As far back as on 5 September 2023, the notice issued by the CBSE made it clear that female students who wanted to apply for attempting Class X and XII Board examinations, as private candidates, were required to upload their domicile certificates. There is no dispute that this has not been done.

 7. 	If this Court were to grant the relief sought by the petitioners it would render Condition 1 in Clause (p) of the Notice dated 5 September 2023 completely redundant. It would also set a precedent where students, without complying with said clause, can nonetheless come to the Court at the eleventh hour and obtain orders allowing them to participate in the examination. 

8. 	It is true that every statutory requirement, which is facially mandatory, may not always be so. Procedural statutory requirements, even if conditioned by the use of the word shall, are often treated as directory. In the present case, however, the CBSE deals with lakhs  or maybe more  of applications. Procedural requirements, and the stipulations regarding the documents and details which are to accompany an application are not, therefore, dispensable, more so when the submission of applications is online, and there is little scope for physical verification. If Courts start benevolently granting relief even in cases where there is no strict compliance with these requirements, it can throw the system into anarchy. Save in rare cases, therefore, the Court should not treat such stipulations as dispensable, in pursuit of what it may feel is substantial justice. 

9. 	While the Court, therefore, sincerely regrets being unable to come to the aid of the petitioners, that is unfortunately what the law ordains. 10. For the aforesaid reason, it is not possible to grant the relief sought in this writ petition. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed in limine. 
(Emphasis supplied) 

5.	In this regard, we may note that the Domicile Certificate is issued by Government of NCT of Delhi to an individual, who is residing continuously for the last three years within the territorial jurisdiction of NCT of Delhi. 

6. 	The Appellants have relied upon their Aadhaar to substitute the requirement of the domicile certificate. In this regard, we may refer to Section 9 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (Aadhaar Act), wherein, it is specifically stated that the Aadhaar is not a proof of domicile. Section 9 of the Aadhaar Act reads as under:

 9. 	Aadhaar number not evidence of citizenship or domicile, etc.The Aadhaar number or the authentication thereof shall not, by itself, confer any right of, or be proof of, citizenship or domicile in respect of an Aadhaar number holder. 
(Emphasis supplied) 

7. 	In view of the said provision in the Aadhaar Act, the stipulation in the Notice dated 5th September, 2023 requiring the applicant to file a domicile certificate issued by the competent authority is reasonable and justified. 

8. 	The exception carved out for private female students by the Notice dated 5th September, 2023 is a privilege extended only to the bona fide residents of NCT of Delhi. To avail the said privilege, the requirement to satisfy the domicile in NCT of Delhi is an essential condition. Further to establish such a domicile, the Notice categorically notified the applicant that he/she must submit a domicile certificate with the application form. The law is well settled that a person, who claims benefit of an exception, has to strictly comply with the conditions for availing the said exception. It is well settled that exemptions and notifications have to be construed strictly. The Supreme Court in CCE v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal3 has held as under: 

Exemption clause  Strict construction 
29. The law is well settled that a person who claims exemption or concession has to establish that he is entitled to that exemption or concession. A provision providing for an exemption, concession or exception, as the case may be, has to be construed strictly with certain exceptions depending upon the settings on which the provision has been placed in the statute and the object and purpose to be achieved. If exemption is available on complying with certain conditions, the conditions have to be complied with. The mandatory requirements of those conditions must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, though at times, some latitude can be shown, if there is a failure to comply with some requirements which are directory in nature, the non-compliance of which would not affect the essence or substance of the notification granting exemption.. 

31.	 Of course, some of the provisions of an exemption notification may be directory in nature and some are mandatory in nature. A distinction between the provisions of a statute which are of substantive character and were built in with certain specific objectives of policy, on the one hand, and those which are merely procedural and technical in their nature, on the other, must be kept clearly distinguished. In Tisco Ltd. [(2005) 4 SCC 272] this Court held that the principles as regard construction of an exemption notification are no longer res integra; whereas the eligibility clause in relation to an exemption notification is given strict meaning wherefor the notification has to be interpreted in terms of its language, once an assessee satisfies the eligibility clause, the exemption clause therein may be construed literally. An eligibility criterion, therefore, deserves a strict construction, although construction of a condition thereof may be given a liberal meaning if the same is directory in nature. 
(Emphasis supplied)

 9. 	The Appellants have failed to file the domicile certificate and they cannot seek waiver of the said condition in the writ proceedings. The proof of domicile is an essential condition for proving that the appellants fall in the excepted category covered by the Notice. 

10.	Similarly, the Supreme Court in Shikhar and Anr. v. National Board of Examination & Ors.4 has repeatedly reiterated that power of judicial review in matter concerning academic policies, which includes setting down of eligibility criteria for writing examinations, should be exercised with care and circumspection. The endeavor to mitigate the hardship of the petitioning persons should not result in unintended consequences adversely affecting the ongoing process of examination. The relevant paragraphs of the judgment read as under: 

9. 	While we understand that the present cut-off date for the completion of the internship would put certain students at a disadvantage, we are conscious that it is the domain of the executive and regulatory authorities to formulate appropriate eligibility standards for admission. In Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur v. Soutrik Sarangi, a three-judge Bench of this Court held that courts should be circumspect in exercising their powers of judicial review in matters concerning academic policies, including admission criteria. In that case, this Court refused to interfere with the eligibility criteria for appearing in JEE (Advanced) 2021 which prevented a candidate who had secured a seat in one of the IITs from competing in a subsequent examination. This Court relied on All India Council for Technical Education v. Surinder Kumar Dhawan, where it was observed that judicial interference motivated by concerns of mitigating the hardship faced by students may result in unintended consequences adversely affecting the education system. This Court held thus: 

""19.	 The reasoning of the High Court of Criterion 5 not permitting IIT students to participate in IIT (Advanced) for the second time being arbitrary, in the opinion of this Court is not supportable. This Court has repeatedly emphasized that in matters such as devising admissions criteria or other issues engaging academic institutions, the courts' scrutiny in judicial review has to be careful and circumspect. Unless shown to be plainly arbitrary or discriminatory, the court would defer to the wisdom of administrators in academic institutions who might devise policies in regard to curricular admission process, career progression of their employees, matters of discipline or other general administrative issues concerning the institution or university. It was held by this court in All India Council for Technical Education v. Surinder Kumar Dhawan. 

""16.

If the courts start entertaining petitions from individual institutions or students to permit courses of their choice, either for their convenience or to alleviate hardship or to provide better opportunities, or because they think that one course is equal to another, without realizing the repercussions on the field of technical education in general, it will lead to chaos in education and deterioration in standards of education."" 

20. 	Given this general reluctance of courts to substitute the views of academic and expert bodies, the approach of the High Court in proceeding straightaway to characterize the rationale given by the IIT in fashioning the Criteria No. 5 cannot be supported. 
(emphasis supplied) 
    .
11.	Whenever a cut-off is extended, some students are likely to fall on the other side of the dividing line. In State of Bihar v. Ramjee Prasad, the State had prescribed that applicants applying for the post of Assistant Professors must have three years of experience. In the preceding year, the cut-off date for the receipt of applications was set in June, however, in the year in question, the date was fixed in January making certain candidates ineligible owing to their failure to meet the three-year requirement. This Court held that the cut-off date cannot be held to be arbitrary unless it is shown that it is unreasonable, capricious or whimsical even if no reasons are forthcoming as to the choice of date. 
(Emphasis supplied) 

12. 	The learned counsel for the Respondents has argued that the relief sought for in the present appeal if granted will cause disruption in the ongoing process of Class X and Class XII Board Examinations of 2024 being held by CBSE. The Respondents have stated it is neigh impossible to integrate the Appellants at this advanced stage of examination and in addition it will cause discrimination to the other similarly placed applicants, who have not approached the Court.

(All emphasis in original)


9. Mr. Sahil Mongia, learned counsel for the petitioner seeks to distinguish the decision of the Division Bench by reference to paras 1.5 and 1.6 thereof, which read thus:
1.5. The Appellants submitted their respective online application(s) without the Domicile Certificate. It is stated that the Appellants uploaded their Aadhar Cards with the application form. The Appellants have placed on record the confirmation issued on the Web Portal with following application numbers to the Appellants: (i) Vishakha i.e., Appellant No.1 was allotted WW200040; dated 15th September, 2023 (ii) Priya Das i.e., Appellant No.2 was allotted DW100022; dated 29th September, 2023. 

1.6. 	The exams were scheduled to begin on 19th February 2023. However, since the Appellants were not issued their admit card(s) and therefore the Appellants on 12th February,2024 approached the Regional Office of the Respondents at Patparganj, Delhi. The Regional Office referred the Appellants to the Head Office. Subsequently, on 15th February2024 the Appellants were informed by the Respondents that no admit card(s) would be issued to them as they failed to submit the Domicile Certificate as per Clause (p)(1) of the notice dated 05.09.2023.


10. Thus, according to Mr. Sahil Mongia, the present case is different from the case of the student appellants in Vishakha. The appellants in Vishakha, he submits, were students who had not even been issued admit cards, whereas his client has been issued an admit card.  These two cases, he submits cannot be treated at par, and the fact that his client has been issued an admit card merits her case being treated differently from the case of the appellants before the Division Bench.  He further submits that, in the case of Vishakha, the appellant had also sought replacement of requirement of the Domicile Certificate by the Aadhar Card.
11. These distinctions of fact, cannot, in my opinion, detract from the applicability of the position of law enunciated by the Division Bench in its aforesaid extracted passages from its judgment in Vishakha.  As I have already observed in my decision in Priyanka Darshi, a student, who is erroneously issued an admit card, despite not having uploaded the Domicile certificate and not even having applied for a domicile certificate till then, cannot be placed on a better pedestal than a student who had never been issued an admit card.  The erroneous issuance of an admit card to the former cannot give her a leg up over the latter.

The Division Bench has held that they were not so entitled. If there is no entitlement, the fact of issuance of admit cards cannot confer any special equities in favour of the students. 
13. The ancillary plea advanced by the appellants in Vishakha for replacement the requirement of Domicile Certificate with the Aadhar card is obviously completely tangential to the issue at hand. 
14. In view of the judgment of Division Bench in Vishakha, it is not possible to grant the relief that the petitioner seeks. 
15. This writ petition is accordingly dismissed in limine.
CM APPL. 12783/2024 and CM APPL. 12784/2024
16. These applications do not survive for consideration and stand disposed of.

Patents and Designs (“the Controller”) vide order dated 8 January
2021 passed under Section 15 of the Patents Act, 1970. The appellant
is in appeal against the said order.
2. The impugned order rejects the application on the ground thatC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 2 of 56the claim in the application suffers from want of inventive step vis-a-
visprior art D-2. Though the First Examination Report (FER) dated
15 June 2020 cites four prior art documents D-1 to D-4 as disclosing
all the features of the claims in the subject patent, the notice of
personal hearing, issued consequent to the reply filed by the appellant
to the FER, restricted the allegation of lack of inventive step to
comparison of the subject patent with the prior art D-1 to D-3 and the
final impugned order holds the subject patent to be lacking an
inventive step only vis-a-vis the prior art D-2.
3. I may note that this position was accepted by both sides and
arguments were also advanced before me, on the aspect of
obviousness and inventive subject in the subject patent vis-a-vis the
prior art D-2.
4. The Court is only required, therefore, to examine whether the
subject patent is lacking an inventive step vis-a-vis D-2; in other
words, whether the distinguishing features of the subject patent would
be obvious to a person skilled in the art from the disclosures contained
in D-2 and, therefore, whether the impugned order is correct in
rejecting the appellant’s application on the ground of lack of inventive
step.

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION
The following specification particularly describes the invention
and the manner in which it is to be performed.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
[001] The present invention relates to transportation
management information system. More particularly, it relates to a
system and method to maintain the heavily travelled roadways .
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
[002] In the recent years, with exponential increase in traffic on
the roads, there is lot of pressure on continuous upkeep and
maintenance of the road networks across the cities. Road
authorities are losing the continuous battle for upkeep of the road
because of frequent weather change, improper drainage, improper
or inadequate repair work, improper design of the road, frequent
cutting of the roads for laying cables and conduits, heavy traffic
or heavy vehicles plying on the roads which are not designed to
handle such loads. As a result, road imperfections develop
continuously and need to be managed before they become
dangerous.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 4 of 56[003] Road anomaly may be defined as misalignment in the road
surface due to any cut or crack in the road due to cable laying or
any pothole due to improper water drainage or some 20bump or
uneven level due to manhole cover which leads to sudden braking
or turning of the vehicle as soon as driver tries to negotiate the
anomaly or sometimes if the driver is not able to negotiate then it
leads sudden jerk in the vehicle.
[004] In both the above situations either vehicle damage could
happen, or accident can occur due to sudden application of brakes
or turning of the vehicle. In some cases, skidding of the vehicle
because of sudden braking or turning over has led to fatalities.
Hence, it becomes utmost important to continuously monitor the
road surface condition for anomaly and make sure that the road
condition should not become worse to cause accident or unfit for
driving. Also, the roads can be maintained better if the anomalies
are detected and fixed in the early stages due to less cost of
preventive maintenance as compared to rehabilitation or
upgrading or reconstruction of the roads.
[005] Further, USA patent US9863928 B1 discloses a road
condition detection system for identifying and monitoring road
conditions, and for communicating information regarding road
conditions to various users. The road condition detection system
is provided for capturing data indicative of road conditions and
analyzing the captured data to locate and identify various road
conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as potholes, or weather
conditions, such as ice). In various embodiments, the road
condition detection system includes a road condition sensor array
configured for being attached to a vehicle and for capturing road
condition data. The captured data may be transmitted and assessed
by a server configured for identifying potential road hazards or
other road conditions based on the road condition data captured
by the sensor array. The prior art discloses a system based on
laser and vibration sensors. The system however, does not detect
the severity of the road condition.
[006] Another USA patent US20180068495A1 discloses a
method of detecting and identifying road surface defects is
provided. Motion and position information is received from a
plurality of vehicles. A profile is retrieved for a particular vehicle
from a database of vehicle profiles by using an identifier of the
particular vehicle. One or more criteria are identified for detecting
a particular type of road surface defect based on the retrieved
profile of the particular vehicle. Upon determining that the
received motion and position data satisfies the identified criteria, aC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 5 of 56detection of a road surface defect of the particular type and a
location associated with the detected road surface defect based on
the received position information is reported. The prior art
discloses method of detecting the road conditions using motion
sensors and accelerometer. The method disclosed in prior art is
cost intensive as multiple vehicle types and their sensor data has
to be correlated based on their weight, tyre size, dimensions etc.
[007] Nowadays, various methods and systems are available
based on the technologies related to sensors and laser. These
methods and systems have limitations due to vibration-based
sensors and high costing of laser scanning. Also, the laser sensor
is not efficient in wet weather and narrow roads. Due to these
limitations there is a need of cost effective method and system for
detecting the road anomalies.
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION
[008] The primary objective of the present invention is to
provide a method and system to give prior warning to the
subscribed driver or user for upcoming road issues.
[009] Another objective of the present invention is to provide a
cost-effective method and system for better surveillance of road
condition.
[0010] Yet another objective of the present invention is to
automate the measurement of road condition.
[0011] Yet another objective of present invention is to provide
safe driving assistance to its subscribed users.
[0012] Another objective of the present invention is to provide
a proactive system and a method to report road anomalies
regularly.
[0013] Yet another objective of the present invention is to
provide a method and for periodic tracking of the road conditions
which may help in accessing the quality of re-carpeting or patch
work done.
SUMMARY OF INVENTION
[0014] The present invention proposes a system for tracking the
road anomalies through a dashcam mounted on plurality of
vehicles. The method and system maps and identifies the road
anomalies by analyzing the video of road conditions and classifyC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 6 of 56the road anomalies by earmarking the road anomalies into
potholes, bumps, cracks, etc. and rating them into yellow, amber
and red colors based on certain parameters like dimensions of
anomalies, type of anomaly, type of road on which anomaly has
happened(highway, main city road, colony road, service road,
etc.), GPS co-ordinates, date time stamp when the anomaly has
been reported, changes if any since first time the anomaly has
been reported, area to which the location belongs (sector, area,
wards, zones, sub-district, tehsil/taluka, etc.).

invention in a simplified form.
[0021] Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will
recognize that various changes and modifications of the
embodiments described herein can be made without departing
from the scope of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-
known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and
concisenessC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 7 of 56[0022] Features that are described and/or illustrated with
respect to one embodiment may be used in the same way or in a
similar way in one or more other embodiments and/or in
combination with or instead of the features of the other
embodiments.
[0023] The terms and words used in the following description
and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but,
are merely used to enable a clear and consistent understanding of
the invention. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled
in the art that the following description of exemplary
embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration
purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention.
[0024] It is to be understood that the singular forms “a,” “an,”
and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly
dictates otherwise.
[0025] It should be emphasized that the term
“comprises/comprising” when used in this specification is taken
to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or
components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one
or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups
thereof. The equations used in the specification are only for
computation purpose.
[0026] In accordance with the present invention, Fig. 1 shows
system for detecting road anomalies. The various components of
the system for detecting road anomalies are, data capturing unit
(100), data recording unit (200), data processing unit (300), data
mapping unit (400) and data publishing unit (500):
-Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit (100 and
200) may comprise a High Definition dash board
camera mounted on top of a vehicle, which is driven at
a speed of 20-30 km/hour at a pre-decided route set by
the user. The dashboard camera may be mounted on
front or back of the vehicle, pointing towards the road
surface to capture video of the road surface. As the
vehicle moves, the camera continuously records the
road conditions through its lenses, covering a 130-
degree view. The cameras provide a high definition
view of the road surface and simultaneously the GPS
data is recorded by the GPS data recording unit (200).
Once the survey is done by the camera, the cameraC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 8 of 56footage and GPS log files (.GPX) are downloaded to a
central computer to compute the same.
–Data Processing Unit (300) may comprise of the
central system to process the raw videos and identify
and classify the road anomalies based on training
dataset of the road anomalies. This process also helps in
classifying the severity of the road anomaly data and
notifying the road authorities and subscribed drivers in
case of potential issues. This process also gets the input
of the GPS data like the deceleration in speed at a
particular spot or patch of the road.
–Data Mapping and Publishing Unit (400 and 500)
may comprise the geographical mapping of road
anomalies, creation of anomalies database and its
updation based on road survey conducted, plotting of
the road anomalies on any available web mapping
service based on the route selected by the drivers along
with thename of the roads featuring distress spots and
suggesting alternate route with their anomalies
information. Further, the report generates a map
plotting the exact spots of road distress with color
coding based on severity of road anomalies on the web
map and create a heat map to show the concentration of
road anomalies in the area or zone. This helps both the
road authorities to take necessary actions on preventive
maintenance and the subscribed drivers take the
conscious decision on choosing the appropriate route.
[0027] Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the functioning of data
capturing unit (100) for detecting the road anomalies. The data
capturing unit (100) comprises a dashboard camera (Dashcam), a
Global Positioning System (GPS) and a storage device. The
Dashcam is a video camera with high definition 1080p, 130
degree viewing angle covering all lanes of the road, Wide
Dynamic range (WDR) function which adjusts according to the
ambient light, built in G-sensor for image stabilization in case of
shock or jerk. The Dash cam may be but not limited to, Akaso
dash cam C330. Dashcam records the videos of the roads to
analyses the road anomalies.
[0028] In an embodiment, the dashboard camera and GPS may
be combined.
[0029] Further, Dashboard camera may pair with a
communication device through available network to transfer dataC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 9 of 56to the mobile application. Afterwards, the data from mobile
application can be transferred to central server through any
network. Alternatively, the data may be physically transferred to
central server via storage device such as Secure Digital (SD) card .
[0030] The GPS data recording unit (200) or a GPS logger is a
device which is used to capture the GPS co-ordinates and create a
stream of it so that once the whole route is recorded the data can
be used to trace the vehicle’s path on the map, the date time stamp
and the speed at which the vehicle has traversed the route. The
GPS logger may comprise of GPS receiver, a processing and
storage unit. In an exemplary embodiment, U-blox7 GPS
Receiver, a Raspberry PI model 4 B and 16 GB SD card for
recording the stream of GPS co-ordinates are used. The data
recorded from GPS logger is stored as .GPX file. With every
track being recorded as a .GPX file it is easy to play it in GPX
player software which plays therecorded location position along
with date time stamp and the speed. The captured .GPX files can
be uploaded from Raspberry PI to central server through SSH
protocol in a secure manner for processing at the central server.
The GPS logger will help create a trace of the route travelled by
the vehicle used for road survey. The GPS co-ordinates of
potholes and patches are identified and mapped to identify the
accurate position of road issues.
[0031] Further, the data capturing unit (100) installed on
plurality of vehicles to capture the video and GPS data. Vehicles
may be but not limited to, any utility vehicle deployed by
municipal committees, personal cars, or commercial vehicles such
as trucks, buses etc. but preferably plying during the less traffic
time in the morning when shadows are less prevalent.
[0032] Fig. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) illustrate the process of
classification of road anomalies and mapping of road anomalies
on to a web mapping service application.
[0033] As shown in Figure 3(a), the central server is a high end
desktop machine which process the data captured by data
capturing unit (100). In an exemplary embodiment, a desktop
machine with Intel i7 processor, Nvidia GPU, atleast 16-32 GB
RAM, 512 SSD is used. The central server runs an Artificial
Intelligence based algorithm to identify the road anomaly based
on the trained dataset of road anomalies. Training data set
categorize anomalies in different categories such as potholes,
cracks, scrapped road, bumps, misalignments of manhole covers
and frames. Further, the server classify the quality of roads as fair,
bad or worse and determine the right speed to cross over theC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 10 of 56anomalies based on recent driver experience. It also determines
the alternate travel path for users to avoid travelling over a road
having anomalies.
[0034] Further, as shown in figure 3(b) and 3(c), the video is
processed through the data processing unit (300) to detect the road
anomalies. After processing the video, image frames are recorded
having bounding box corresponding to the detected anomalies
along with date and time stamp. A bounding box is an imaginary
box to demarcate the objects from their surroundings. In digital
image processing, the bounding box is merely the coordinates of
the rectangular border that fully encloses a digital image when it
is placed over a page, a canvas, a screen or other similar bi-
dimensional background. Based on the dimensions of the
anomalies and the data of deceleration on location of the road
anomaly, the road anomaly is classified into fair (yellow), bad
(amber) or worse (red). If there are multiple road anomalies in the
particular stretch of the road the whole patch may be marked as
bad or worse.
[0035] The data mapping unit (400) classifies and labels the road
condition by creating a map of road including road anomalies and
provide the average deceleration in speed to negotiate the road
anomaly. While the driver sees the different routes on the map for
reaching the destination the driver may also choose to select the
route which has less road anomalies.
[0036] In accordance with the present invention the method for
detecting road anomalies is discussed herein:
Step 1: Installation of the dashboard camera and GPS
logger in the vehicle;
Step 2: Starting the dashboard camera and GPS logger
simultaneously when the vehicle starts surveying the
road;
Step 3: Dashboard camera will record the road condition
and GPS logger will start capturing the distance covered,
time taken and speed at each point and creates GPS log
file (.GPX file).
Step 4: The data captured through dashboard camera
and GPS logger is stored in separate local storage
device.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 11 of 56Step 5: The Data stored in the local storage device is
transferred to data processing unit (300).
Step 6: The video is processed through the data
processing unit (300) to detect the road anomalies and
create a bounding box and capture the image frame
along date and time stamp.
Step 7: The data timestamp of image obtained from the
(.GPX file) with road anomaly is compared with the
corresponding time stamp through GPS logger and the
GPS co-ordinates of the road anomalies based on
corresponding GPS time stamp are determined.
Step 8: The road anomaly is further geotagged as red or
amber or yellow to bring to the attention of the user
about the condition and severity of the anomaly on web
mapping application using the GPS coordinates which
will show up as pin on map.
Step 9: The said user can click on the pin to see the
actual image of the road anomaly with the date time
stamp. User will be able to see the severity of the
anomaly and average speed for the patch based on
drivers travelling at off peak hours.
Step10: There might be a date time stamp based and
area wise heat map created to segregate the different
areas where there are more anomalies as compared to
other areas.
[0037] Step 1 to 5 facilitate the data capturing of required data.
Step 6-7 is related to the process of detecting of road anomalies.
Step 8 is based on mapping of road anomalies on the web
mapping service application. Steps 9-10 are facilitating the
publishing of road anomalies to be detected by the users.
[0038] In accordance with the present invention the said process
for classification of the road anomaly and determining its severity
and accordingly determining the speed of vehicle on the same
road is discussed herein:
The severity of the road anomaly is classified based on
correlation of the video of the road labelled through data
mapping system, exact geotagging of the location and
average decelaration of speed during off peak traffic on the
same spot.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 12 of 56Tagging of road anomalies in different color scheme like
red or amber or yellow to bring to the attention of the road
authorities about the severity of the anomaly, so that the
prioritizing and planning of repair work by authorities can
be carried out.
Historical analysis of the deceleration of the speed through
the same location where the anomaly is detected.
Informing the user in advance about the severity of the road
anomaly and the average speed for that patch of road.
[0039] The process of classification of the road anomaly and
determining its severity and the amount of deceleration of speed
from the average speed on the same road is a continuous and
iterative process which will keep on geotagging the new spots or
changing the colors and removing the geotags if the road is re-
surfaced or patch work done.
[0040] In accordance with the present invention FIG. 4, 5 and 6
illustrate the process of publishing of road anomalies to users.
a) Process for visualization of the road conditions based
on specific area includes:
Collecting and processing the data of road
anomalies for a particular area for a period of every
10-15 days to show the variation in data over a
period of time.
Geographically color code the sub areas within area
based on number of anomalies and their severity.
b) Process for identifying the route, automatic
downloading of the road anomalies data for the route and
providing the suggestions if the road quality is really
worse consists the following:
User switches on the web mapping service
application and selects the destination and presses
start.
System identifies the current location and the
destination location and selects the best route.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 13 of 56System downloads the road anomalies data for the
route from the current database of road anomalies
and shows it visually to the subscribed driver on
web mapping service application.
The driver is given warning of the upcoming road
anomaly based on its severity and subscribed
driver’s speed (only on mobile application). The
system also tells about the average speed at which
driver should cross the particular patch of road
based on past few days’ data for off peak traffic.
c) Process of warning the driver (only on mobile
application) in case the upcoming road anomaly is severe
or driver is at higher speed as compared to average speed
in off peak hour includes:
Subscribed user’s speed is calculated based on GPS
logger installed and route is detected.
The route currently being undertaken is compared
against road anomaly’s database and the average
speed for past few days for off peak hour.
Driver is given audio warning if the driver’s speed is
much higher for approaching anomaly.
[0041] The method of publishing the information about
upcoming road anomalies may give visual and audio alert to
subscribed user in case the driver is at higher speed then
prescribed speed for the respective patch.
[0042] In accordance with the present invention the advantages
offered by the present invention are:
Enabling easy survey of roads for locating distress
spots, requiring minimal human involvement.
Leveraging technology to efficiently cover a large
area within the monitoring framework within less
time.
Leveraging technology to capture any other incident
along the streets like dumping of construction waste,
spilling of waste, collection of water, etc.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 14 of 56Enabling report generation that details out the near-
exact location of the potholes and other distress spots
on the scanned roads, thus making it convenient for
the city authorities to identify the locations as well as
assess the distress severity, and accordingly take
prompt action.
The present invention uses a dashcam a specialized
camera having wide angle of 130 degree, G sensor
for image stabilization for capturing road conditions
and subsequent video analysis through AI algorithm
for detecting and classifying the road conditions and
correlating with the data on deceleration in speed
from multitude of vehicles at the same spot on the
road irrespective of traffic condition and other
adverse conditions for further classifying the road
conditions. The present invention does all the
processing centrally and focuses on analysis of
pothole and road surface anomalies.

with what is presently considered to be the most practical and
preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is

7. One may simplify the features of the subject patent as they
emerged from the complete specifications reproduced ( supra ), thus:
(i) The subject patent is intended to detect road anomalies.
The expression “road anomalies” is a compendious term
covering any defect in road surface, owing to any cut and crack
in the road, pothole, bump or uneven level, which would require
a driver driving on the road, to suddenly brake or turn theC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 17 of 56vehicle or if he does not do so, to a sudden jerk in the vehicle.
As this can result in accident, mapping of road anomalies is
necessary, both for notifying the concerned authorities, who can
rectify the roads as well as to inform subscribed drivers of such
anomalies, so that they can negotiate the vehicle appropriately
or choose roads, which are more easily negotiable.
8. Five objectives of the claimed inventions are identified, viz.
(a) Providing a method and system to give prior warning to a
subscribed driver or user of upcoming road issues, (b) providing
a cost effective method and system for better surveillance of
road condition, (c) automating measurements of road condition,
(d) providing safe driving assistance to subscribed users, (e)
providing a proactive system and a method to report road
anomalies regularly and (f) providing a method for periodic
tracking of road conditions.
9. The method claimed in the subject patent, when adopted, fulfils
two purposes. Firstly, it analyzes the video of the road so as to map
the conditions of the road. Secondly, it classifies road anomalies by
earmarking them on the basis of the type of anomaly and rating the
anomaly as yellow, amber or red, based on pre-determined
parameters. Thirdly, the complete specifications are accompanied by
drawings, designated as figures 1, 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4, 5
and 6. These drawings, followed four steps:C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 18 of 56(a) Detection of the anomalies by a Data Capturing Unit,
(b) Classification of the anomalies,
(c) Mapping of the anomalies,
(d) Publication of the data to users
I may note, here, that when one peruses Claims 1 to 8 in the suit
patent – already reproduced ( supra ) – it is clear that fourth step noted
hereinabove, i.e. publication of the data to users is not part of the
claims in the subject patent.
10. The claimed invention is divided in complete specifications,
into:
(a) Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit,
(b) Data Processing Unit and
(c) Data Mapping and Publishing Unit.
11. The Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit comprises the
following features:
(a) The unit has:
(i) a camera,
(ii) a Global Positioning System (GPS) and
(iii) a storage device.
(b) The camera has
(i) a WDR function which adjusts to ambient light
(ii) a G – sensor for image stabilisation in the case ofC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 19 of 56jerk.
(iii) The camera is a high definition dashboard camera
mounted atop the vehicle at the front or the rear. It points
towards the surface of the road. It has a 130 degree
viewing lens. It can be mounted at a multitude of the
vehicles.
12. The vehicle is to be driven at a speed of 20 to 30 kilometre per
hour at a pre-decided route set by the user. As the vehicle moves, the
camera records a video of the entire road surface, including any
anomaly in the road covering of 130 degree view.
13. The GPS data of the road is simultaneously recorded on the
GPS recording unit.
14. The GPS Data Recording Unit – (hereinafter the GPS DRU) –
alternatively called the GPS logger - consists of a GPS receiver and a
processing/storing unit.
15. The GPS DRU captures the GPS coordinates of the road and
creates a stream so that it is possible to trace the path of the vehicle,
the date time stamp and the speed of the vehicle.
16. The data is stored as a .GPX file, which can easily be played
using GPX player software which, when played, would identify the
position of the vehicle, date and time stamp and the speed.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 20 of 5617. Thus, the GPS DRU identifies anomalies and maps them so that
accurate locations are identified.
18. The camera footage and the GPS log files (in .GPX format) are
downloaded to a central computer.
19. Alternatively, the camera may be paired with a mobile through
a mobile application, and the mobile can send the data to the central
server. Again, alternatively, the video recording recorded by the
camera can be physically transferred to the central server through a
Secure Digital (SD) Card.
20. The Data Process Unit consists of a central server, which is a
desktop machine that processes the data captured by the camera and
the GPS DRU and mapped by the GPS DRU.
21. The central server identifies road anomalies based on a dataset.
The trained dataset classifies the anomalies into various categories
such as potholes, cracks, scrapped road, bumps, misalignments of
manhole covers, and the like.
22. The central server thereafter classifies the road, based on the
nature of anomalies contained therein as fair (yellow), bad (amber) or
worse (red) and, thereby, identifies the quality of road by colour
coding.
23. Based on this data, the central server determines the speed atC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 21 of 56which the anomaly is to be negotiated, based on recent driving
experience and also suggests alternate travel path which could be
adopted.
24. The data mapping and publishing unit does the following
function:
(a) It geographically maps the road anomaly.
(b) It creates an anomalies database which is updated from
time to time based on surveys.
(c) It plots the road anomalies on a web mapping service,
depending on the route selected by the user.
(d) The road anomalies thus plotted identified the name of
the road as well as colour coded distress spots on the road.
(e) It suggests alternative routes which can be adopted.
25. As such, the data mapping and publishing unit creates a heat
map which identifies concentration of road anomalies on various
roads. This serves two functions. It helps authorities to repair the
roads and correct the anomalies and also helps subscribed drivers to
negotiate the anomalies and select alternate routes.
26. Thus, the entire method claimed in the subject patent involves
(a) Classification of the road anomaly, by co-relating the
video of the road labelled through the data mapping system,C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 22 of 56exact geo tagging of the anomaly and average deceleration of
speed while negotiating the anomaly.
(b) Tagging of the road anomalies in colour coded fashion so
as to inform the authorities about the severities of the anomalies
and enable them to prioritize and plan repair work.
(c) Conducting historical analysis of the deceleration through
the location where the anomaly is detected and
(d) Informing subscribed users in advance of the existence
and severity of road anomalies.
27. The specifications clarified that the aforesaid process is
continuous and iterative so that that new spots are continuously geo-
tagged, anomalies specific colours are changed from time to time
and, if the road is re-surfaced or patch work is done, geo-tags are
removed.
28. Thus, the process for visualization of road conditions based on
specific area includes (a) collection and processing of road anomalies
data for a particular area for a particular period of 10-15 days so that
periodical variation in road anomalies can be noted and (b)
geographical colour coding of the sub-areas within the area based on
number and severity of anomalies.
29. Para 0040 of the complete specifications also refers to the
process of communication of the road anomalies to the subscriber
drivers/users. The user is required to switch on the web mapping
service application, select the destination to which he intends toC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 23 of 56travel and press ‘Start’. When he does so, the system identifies his
existing location, destination location and selects the best route1.
30. From the database of road anomalies, the system downloads the
road anomaly data for the road that the driver has selected and shows
it to the driver on the web mapping service application. The driver is
thus warned of the upcoming road anomaly based on severity and the
speed of the driver. The driver is also provided suggestion of the
average speed at which the anomaly should be negotiated.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
Various embodiments of the present invention described herein
generally relate to a road condition detection system for detecting
and monitoring road conditions.
Description of Related Art
Various road conditions may make a road difficult to navigate or
increase the risk of damage to a vehicle driving on the road. Some
of these conditions include road imperfections (e.g., potholes,
bumps, and cracks), weather conditions (e.g., wet or icy roads),
low visibility (e.g., due to street lights being out), or debris in the
road (e.g., tree limbs, gravel, and car accident debris). If one of
these conditions is present on a given road, it would be
advantageous for drivers to be notified so they may avoid a
particular road hazard or hazardous road condition. Additionally, it
would be advantageous for appropriate agencies, such as the local
Department of Transportation, to be notified so that hazardous
conditions can be addressed and the public may be apprised of
current road conditions.
Several media outlets exist that inform drivers of road
conditions, such as local news stations, local radio stations, and
online traffic sites. Similarly, government agencies (e.g.,
Department of Transportation) have systems that enable drivers to
report roadway conditions to the appropriate personnel. However,
the above-described media outlets and agencies often depend on
people manually reporting road conditions. For example, if a driver
sees a hazardous condition on a given road, the driver may call the
Department of Transportation and describe the condition and its
location (e.g., a pothole or patch of ice). In order to address the
road condition, the Department of Transportation may first send a
crew to locate the condition, which may be difficult to do
depending on the description given by the driver. Furthermore,
information regarding the road condition may become inaccurate
through the chain of communication (e.g., where one DOT
employee describes the condition inaccurately to another
responsible for a repair or inspection). In addition, the crew may
also need to inspect the identified road condition to determine what
must be done to address it. At some later point in time, a separateC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 25 of 56crew may be sent to address the condition. This process is often
imprecise and inefficient, thereby resulting in lingering hazardous
road conditions posing a continuing threat to drivers and vehicles.
Accordingly, there is an ongoing need in the art for systems
and methods for more efficiently identifying and reporting road
conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter
with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but
not all embodiments of the inventions are shown. Indeed, these
inventions may be embodied in many is different forms and should
not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein;
rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will
satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like
elements throughout.
Overview
The present invention relates to systems and methods for
identifying and monitoring road conditions, and for communicating
information regarding road conditions to various users. According
to various embodiments, a road condition detection system is
provided for capturing data indicative of road conditions and
analyzing the captured data to locate and identify various road
conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as potholes, or weather
conditions, such as ice). In various embodiments, the road
condition detection system comprises a road condition sensor array
configured for being attached to a vehicle and for capturing road
condition data, an onboard computer for analyzing the road
condition data in real time and transmitting information regarding
road conditions to remotes users of the system, and a central data
analysis server configured for conducting post processing analysis
of the data collected by the road condition sensor array to
determine additional information about various road conditions.
In various embodiments, the road condition sensor array is
configured to sense and record information about a given road as
the vehicle travels along the road. For example, the road condition
sensor array may include an optical camera, a vibration sensor, a
road surface scanner, and various other devices configured toC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 27 of 56capture road condition data indicative of various road condition
attributes, such as a road's surface profile, imperfections,
illumination level, reflectivity, and/or other conditions. The road
condition sensor array may also include, or may be in
communication with, a geo-location device, allowing the system to
geo-code the location of road condition data indicative of these
attributes. According to various embodiments, a plurality of
vehicles in a fleet (e.g., a fleet of delivery vehicles) may each be
equipped with a road condition sensor array, thereby capturing
road condition data for various roads over a wide area at various
times.
In various embodiments, the road condition data collected
by the road condition sensor array may be processed and stored (in
whole or in part) by an onboard vehicle computer. In addition, the
data capturing operations of the road condition sensor array may be
controlled by the onboard computer, which may dictate when the
road condition sensor array captures road condition data and the
frequency with which it does so. In addition, the onboard computer
may include various telematics devices and sensors monitoring
dynamic attributes of the vehicle, or may be in communication
with a separate telematics devices or sensors provided on the
vehicle.
As described in greater detail below, the road condition
data captured by the road condition sensor array may be analyzed
by the onboard computer in order to identify various road
conditions based on the road condition data (e.g., bumps, potholes,
debris, wet or icy conditions, etc.). Information advising users of
these various conditions may then be transmitted from the onboard
computer to one or more users devices in real time over a network.
In addition, the road condition data may be analyzed further by the
central server to identify additional road conditions (e.g., more
detailed information regarding cracks and potholes, visibility
conditions, weather conditions, etc.). In addition, the central data
analysis server may be configured to create data applied to maps
indicating various road conditions (e.g., layers applied to digital
maps), calculate a road condition index for individual roads or
areas, and compare changes in road conditions for particular roads
or locations. The analyses performed by the central server may be
useful, for example, in identifying and communicating road
conditions to drivers and for evaluation of road repairs and
maintenance.

various road image detection devices, including an optical camera,
a vibration sensor, and a road surface scanner. As the vehicle 110
drives along a road 5, the road condition sensor array's sensing unit
121a captures road condition data relating to the conditions of the
road 5. For example, the captured road condition data may include
video data, surface profile data, illumination level data, vibration
data, and other data generated by other devices in the sensing unit
121a. As described in greater detail below, the sensing unit's
devices are in communication with the vehicle's onboard computer
130, which may be configured to control the operation of the
sensing unit 121a and store captured road condition data.
In various embodiments, the sensing unit 121a includes an
optical camera configured to capture video and/or still images of
the road surface and detect the illumination level of the road 5. For
example, in one embodiment, the optical camera may be
configured to capture video of the road surface continuously as the
vehicle 110 travels. In such embodiments, the onboard computer
130 may continuously store video data generated by the optical
camera and may be configured to buffer and transmit data to a user
device 180.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 29 of 56According to various embodiments, the optical camera may
also be configured to receive light from the road through an
aperture in the camera housing, which may vary in size to control
the amount of light reaching the optical sensor. The optical sensor
is configured to detect the intensity of the light received through
the aperture resulting in illumination level data corresponding to
the illumination level of the road 5at a given point. Accordingly, if
the vehicle 110 is traveling at night along a lighted road and passes
by an area where street lights are out, the illumination level data
will indicate a reduction in luminous intensity. Similarly, the
illumination level data may indicate poor illumination in tunnels,
under bridges, or in covered areas (e.g., parking lots). In this way
the optical camera is able to capture illumination level data
indicative of a particular road's varying illumination levels along
the distance traveled by the vehicle 110.
In various embodiments, the optical camera may be further
configured to detect the reflectivity of the surface of the road 5.
This may be accomplished, for example, by the camera emitting
light (e.g., via a flash bulb or LED bulb) and detecting the level of
light reflected by the road surface. As such, the optical camera is
able to capture reflectivity data indicative of the surface reflectivity
of the road 5at any given point. Accordingly, if a road surface is
wet (e.g., due to rain or an oil leak) or coated with another
hazardous substance, the reflectivity data will indicate a
comparative increase in the reflectivity of the road surface.
Likewise, where the road is dry, the reflectivity data will indicate a
comparative decrease in the reflectivity of the road surface. In this
way. the optical camera is also able to capture reflectivity data
indicative of a particular road’s varying reflectivity along the
distance traveled by the vehicle 110.
As will be appreciated from the description herein, the
optical camera may be configured to capture video data,
illumination level data, and reflectivity data, or two or more
cameras may be provided, each being configured to capture
illumination level data or reflectivity data. In addition, a lens may
be disposed within the camera housing aperture and a shutter
and/or lens cover may cover the lens when the camera is not
actively recording illumination level data or reflectivity data. In
this way, the shutter and/or lens cover may protect the lens from
damage such as being scratched or cracked. In other embodiments,
the illumination level data and reflectivity data may be captured via
other suitable devices. such as laser sensors or the like.
In addition to the optical camera, the sensing unit 121a mayC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 30 of 56include a road surface scanner may comprise a laser or
electromagnetic sensor disposed within a scanner housing. As the
vehicle travels along the road 5,the sensor is configured to scan
the surface of the road 5and capture surface profile data indicative
of the road’s surface profile. Accordingly, if the vehicle 110travels
over a pothole, the captured surface profile data will indicate a
depression in the road surface. Likewise. if the vehicle 110travels
over piece of debris or other object on the surface of the road 5, the
captured surface profile data will indicate a protrusion on the road
surface. In this way. the road surface scanner is able to capture
surface profile data indicative of a particular road’s full surface
profile along the distance traveled by the vehicle 110.
As noted above, the sensing unit 121a also includes a
vibration sensor configured to capture vibration data indicative of
the magnitude and frequency of vibration of the vehicle 110as it
travels along the road. For example, in one embodiment, the
vibration sensor is configured to detect vibrations in the vehicle’s
chassis (e.g., vibrations transmitted from the road surface through
the wheels and suspension to the chassis). Accordingly, if the
vehicle 110travels over a pot hole, the vibration data captured by
the vibration sensor will indicate a sharp change in vibration
magnitude or frequency. Additionally, if the vehicle 110 is
traveling a smooth road. the vibration data will indicate a low-
magnitude, consistent vehicle vibration, while a rough road will
result in inconsistent vibration data corresponding to various
bumps and imperfections in the road surface. In this way, the
vibration sensor is also able to capture vibration data indicative of
the smoothness of a particular road along the distance traveled by
the vehicle 110.
According to various embodiments, the sensing unit 121a
may further comprise an infrared camera, a noise detecting device,
and/or other road condition detecting devices. For example, the
infrared camera may be used for capturing infrared data indicative
of hot spots on the road surface while the noise detecting device
may be used for capturing noise data indicative of loud noises
associated with a vehicle traveling over a pot hole or other debris.
Indeed, as will be appreciated from the description herein, the
sensing unit 121a may include any road condition detecting device
capable of detecting useful data indicative of one or more road
conditions. Additionally, in some embodiments, the various
cameras and/or sensors of the road condition sensor array 120may
have zoom capabilities in order to capture road condition data with
at varying degrees of granularity.
As shown in FIG. 2, the various devices of the sensing unitC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 31 of 56121¢ are secured within a mounting housing 122a. In the illustrated
embodiment, the mounting housing 122a is mounted to the front
bumper of vehicle 110and faces the road surface directly in front
of the vehicle 110(e.g. as indicated by the dashed lines in FIG. 2).
In certain embodiments, the mounting housing 122 includes a
quick release mechanism configured to engage a mating member
on the vehicle’s front bumper. This allows the sensing unit 121a to
be easily removed from vehicle 110and easily mounted on another
vehicle. Moreover, as will be appreciated from the description
herein, the vehicle 110may include a plurality of mating members
positioned at various locations on the vehicle 110 (e.g., front
bumper, rear bumper, centrally underneath vehicle, side of vehicle
frame, etc.) such that the one or more road condition sensor arrays
120can be secured at various locations on the vehicle 110.
In the illustrated embodiment, the road condition sensing
array 120also includes a rear sensing unit 121b secured within a
rear mounting housing 122b. According to various embodiments,
the rear sensing unit 121b may comprise the same, or one or more
of, the various sensors and detection devices provided in the front
sensing unit 121a. In addition, the rear mounting housing 122b
may be substantially the same as, or similar to, the front mounting
housing 122a. As will be appreciated from FIG. 2, the provision of
both front and rear sensing units 121a,122b enables the road
condition sensing array 120 to capture additional road condition
data to verify various road conditions. Indeed, in certain
embodiments, the rear sensing unit 121b may be configured to
capture road condition data to confirm road conditions indicated by
the road condition data captured by the front sensing unit 121a.
In various other embodiments, the sensing units 121a,121b
and mounting housings 122a,122b may be provided at any suitable
location on the vehicle 110 depending on its configuration and
intended use. In addition, according to various embodiments, less
or additional sensing units may be provided as needed. For
example, in certain embodiments. only a single front or rear
sensing unit may be provided. In other embodiments, additional
sensing units may be placed on lateral sides of the vehicle.
Onboard Computer & Communications Network
According to various embodiments, the road condition
sensor array’s sensing units 121a,121b may be controlled by the
vehicle’s onboard computer 130. In various embodiments, the
onboard computer 130comprises at least one processor, a location-
determining device or sensor (e.g., a GPS sensor), a real-time
clock, J-Bus protocol architecture, an electronic control moduleC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 32 of 56(ECM), a port for receiving data from vehicle sensors located on
the vehicle 110, a communication port for receiving instruction
data, a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a power source, a
data radio for communication with a WWAN, a WLAN and/or a
WPAN, a programmable logic controller (PLC), and one or more
memory storage devices. The memory storage devices may include
volatile memory and/or non-volatile memory, which can be
embedded and/or may be removable. For example, the non-volatile
memory may be embedded or removable multimedia memory
cards (“MMCs”), secure digital (“SD”) memory cards. Memory
Sticks, EEPROM, flash memory, hard disk, or the like. The
memory storage device may also include DRAM and NVRAM
memory modules. In other embodiments, various components of
the onboard computer 130(e.g., the RFID tag, the location sensor,
and the PLC) may be located in the vehicle 110, external from the
onboard computer 130.
The onboard computer’s location sensor may be, for
example, a GPS-based sensor compatible with a low Earth orbit
(LEO) satellite system, medium Earth orbit satellite system, or a
Department of Defense (DOD) satellite system. Alternatively,
triangulation may be used in connection with various cellular
towers positioned at various locations throughout a geographic area
in order to determine the location of the vehicle 110. The location
sensor may be used to receive position, time, and speed data. In
addition, the location sensor may be configured to detect when its
vehicle 110 has entered or exited a GPS-defined geographic area
(e.g., a geo-fenced area). As will be appreciated from the
description herein, more than one location sensor may be utilized,
and other similar techniques may likewise be used to collect geo-
location information associated with the vehicle 110.
In addition, various embodiments of the onboard computer 130
may include multiple processors configured for carrying out the
various processes described herein. As will be appreciated from the
description herein, the onboard computer 130 may not include
certain of the components described above, and may include any
other suitable components in addition to, or in place of, those
described above. As an example, the onboard computer 130 may
include various types of communications components (e.g., to
support new or improved communications techniques).
In the illustrated embodiment, the onboard computer 130 is
generally configured to communicate with the road condition
sensor array’s sensing units 121a,121b in order to (i) control when
the sensing units 121a,122b capture road condition data, (ii) store
the road condition data captured by the sensing units 121a,122b,C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 33 of 56and (iii) transmit the stored road condition data to the central server
170and/or the user device 180. For example, in one embodiment,
the onboard computer 130causes the sensing units 121a,122bto
capture road condition data continuously as the vehicle 110travels.
In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 causes the
sensing units 121a,122bto capture road condition data at given
time intervals when the vehicle 110is on (e.g., such that all of the
sensing unit’s sensors capture data every second, every 2 seconds,
or every 5 seconds). In other embodiments, the onboard computer
130causes the sensing units 121a,122b to capture road condition
data at given distance intervals as the vehicle 110 travels down
road 5(e.g., such that all of the sensing unit’s sensors capture data
every 5 feet, every 10 feet, or every 50 feet traveled).
In further embodiments, the onboard computer 130causes
the sensing units 121a,122bto start or stop capturing road
condition data when the vehicle 110changes direction, goes over a
bump, or accelerates. In addition, the onboard computer 130may
be configured to monitor signals received from the sensing units
121a,122band capture data only when certain predefined
parameters are met (e.g., illumination intensity below a predefined
valued or a road surface profile deviating more than a certain
amount from a predefined base profile). Moreover, the onboard
computer 130may be configured to trigger data capture by one or
more specific devices in the sensing units 121a,122baccording to
the criteria above. Indeed. as will be appreciated from the
description herein, the onboard computer 130may be programmed
to trigger data capture by the sensing units 121a,122baccording to
any desirable parameters.
As noted above, the onboard computer 130 includes a
location-determining device or sensor, such as a GPS sensor, and a
real-time clock. Accordingly, in various embodiments, the onboard
computer 130 may be configured to associate and store location
and/or date and time information—e.g., as indicated by the location
sensor and clock—with the road condition data collected by the
road condition sensor array 120. By associating location and date
and time information with the road condition data captured by the
road condition sensor array 120, the physical and temporal location
of a road hazard indicated by the road condition data may be
determined (e.g., by the central server 170as explained below).
In various embodiments, the road condition data captured
by the road condition sensor array 120 may be stored in the
onboard computer 130 (e.g. in the computer’s memory storage
devices). For example, in certain embodiments, the onboard
computer 130is configured to store road condition data collected
by the road condition sensor array 120 continuously as it is
captured. In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 isC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 34 of 56configured to store road condition data collected by the road
condition sensor array 120 only if the onboard computer 130
detects a deviation in the road condition data that may indicate the
presence of a road hazard (e.g., a change in vibration frequency or
road surface profile). In yet another embodiment, the onboard
computer 130 is configured to store only road condition data
captured within a particular geo-fenced area.
As described in greater detail below, the road condition
data captured by the road condition sensor array 120and stored by
the onboard computer 130is transmitted to the central server 170
via a communications network 150. According to various
embodiments of the present invention, the communications
network 150 may be capable of supporting communication in
accordance with any one or more of a number of second-generation
(2G), 2.5G and/or third-generation (3G) mobile communication
protocols or the like. More particularly, the network 150 may be
capable of supporting communication in accordance with 2G
wireless communication protocols IS-136 (TDMA), GSM, and IS-
95 (CDMA). Also, for example, the network 150may be capable
of supporting communication in accordance with 2.5G wireless
communication protocols GPRS, Enhanced Data GSM
Environment (EDGE), or the like. In addition, for example, the
network 150 can be capable of supporting communication in
accordance with 3G wireless communication protocols such as
Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) network employing
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) radio access
technology. Some narrow-band AMPS (NAMPS), as well as
TACS, network(s) may also benefit from embodiments of the
present invention, as should dual or higher mode mobile stations
(e.g., digital/ analog or TDMA/CDMA/analog phones). As yet
another example, the network 150may support communication in
accordance with techniques such as, for example, radio frequency
(RF), Bluetooth ™, infrared (IrDA), or any of a number of different
wireless networking techniques, including Wireless LAN (WLAN)
techniques.
In certain embodiments, the onboard computer 130may be
configured to transmit stored road condition data whenever it is
able to establish a successful connection with the central server 170
via a WLAN component of the network 150(e.g., when the vehicle
110returns to a hub broadcasting a wireless networking signal). In
addition, the onboard computer 130may be further configured to
immediately transmit (e.g. via 3G cellular network) captured road
condition data meeting predefined “alert” parameters (e.g., road
condition data clearly indicating a road hazard, such as a pothole or
debris). In such embodiments, the onboard computer 130 (and/orC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 35 of 56central server 170) may be further configured to transmit the alert-
status road condition data to the Department of Transportation,
local media outlets, or other online road condition services in order
to provide real-time status updates for various roads.
Central Server
According to various embodiments, the road condition data
captured by the road condition sensor array 120and stored by the
onboard computer 130 may be subsequently transmitted over the
network 150to the central server 170for post processing. As will
be appreciated from the description herein, the central server 170
includes various devices for performing one or more functions in
accordance with embodiments of the present invention, including
those more particularly shown and described herein. However,
various embodiments of the central server 170 may include
alternative devices for performing one or more like functions
without departing from the spirit and scope of the present
invention.
In various embodiments, the central server 170includes a
processor that communicates with other elements within the central
server 170via a system interface or bus. In some embodiments, the
central server 170 includes a display device/input device for
receiving and displaying data. This display device/input device
may be, for example, a keyboard or pointing device that is used in
combination with a monitor. In certain embodiments, the central
server 170may not include a display device/input device and may
be alternatively accessed by a separate computing device (e.g., a
networked workstation) having a display device and input device.
The central server 170further includes memory, which preferably
includes both read only memory (ROM) and random access
memory (RAM). The server's ROM is used to store a basic
input/output system (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help
to transfer information between elements within the central server
170.
In addition, the central server 170 includes at least one
storage device—such as a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a
CD Rom drive, or optical disk drive—for storing information on
various computer-readable media, such as a hard disk, a removable
magnetic disk, or a CD-ROM disk. As will be appreciated by one
of ordinary skill in the art, each of these storage devices is
connected to the system bus by an appropriate interface. The
storage devices and their associated computer-readable media
provide nonvolatile storage for a personal computer. It is important
to note that the computer-readable media described above could be
replaced by any other type of computer-readable media known in
the art.
A number of program modules may be stored by theC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 36 of 56various storage devices and within RAM. Such program modules
include an operating system and/or a plurality of program modules
(e.g., one or more modules configured for analyzing road condition
data). According to various embodiments, the modules control
certain aspects of the operation of the central server 170with the
assistance of the processor and operating system.
Also located within the central server 170 is a network
interface for interfacing and communicating with other elements of
a computer network. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill
in the art that one or more of the central server 170 components
may be located geographically remotely from other central server
170components. Furthermore, one or more of the components may
be combined, and additional components performing functions
described herein may be included in the central server 170.
While the foregoing describes a single processor, as one of
ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the central server 170may
comprise multiple processors operating in conjunction with one
another to perform the functionality described herein. In addition to
the memory, the processor can also be connected to at least one
interface or other means for displaying, transmitting and/or
receiving data, content or the like. In this regard, the interface(s)
can include at least one communication interface or other means
for transmitting and/or receiving data, content or the like, as well
as at least one user interface that can include a display and/or a
user input interface. The user input interface, in turn, can comprise
any of a number of devices allowing the entity to receive data from
a user, such as a keypad, a touch display, a mouse, a joystick or
other input device.
While reference is made to a central “server” 170, as one
of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, embodiments of the
present invention are not limited to a client-server architecture. The
system of embodiments of the present invention is further not
limited to a single server, or similar network entity or mainframe
computer system. Other similar architectures including one or
more network entities operating in conjunction with one another to
provide the functionality described herein may likewise be used
without departing from the spirit and scope of embodiments of the
present invention. For example, a mesh network of two or more
personal computers (PCs), or similar electronic devices,
collaborating with one another to provide the functionality
described herein in association with the central server 170 may
likewise be used without departing from the spirit and scope of
embodiments of the present invention.
In the illustrated embodiment, the central server 170 is
configured to receive road condition data from the onboard
computer 130 via network 150. For example, in certain s
embodiments, the central server 170 may receive a substantiallyC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 37 of 56real-time data feed via network 150. In other embodiments, the
central server 170 may receive road condition data downloaded
from the onboard computer 130when the vehicle 110is in range of
a WLAN.
Processing of Road Condition Data
FIG. 3illustrates steps executed by the road condition
detection system 100 to analyze captured road condition data
according to one embodiment. As shown in FIG. 3, the process
begins at step 302where road condition data captured by the road
condition sensor array 120is transmitted to the onboard computer
130 via a road sensor input interface. Next, at step 204, the
onboard computer 130performs continuous storage and buffering
of the road condition data received from the sensor array 120.
Simultaneously, in step 306, the onboard computer 130
analyzes the vibration data present in the road condition data. At
step 308, the onboard computer determines whether a bump has
been indicated by the vibration data. For example, where the
vehicle travels over a pothole or piece of debris, the vibration data
captured by the sensor array’s vibration sensor (e.g., an
accelerometer) will indicate a sharp change in vibration. If a bump
is detected, the onboard computer moves to step 310 where it
marks the road condition data corresponding to the detected bump
and freezes the data buffer (e.g., saving and marking the previous
one minute of data).
Next, at step 312, the onboard computer 130 determines
whether real time transmission of road condition information is
enabled. If real time transmission is enabled, the onboard computer
130 moves to step 314 where it immediately transmits road
condition data captured around the impact of the detected bump.
For example, in one embodiment, the onboard computer 130may
immediately transfer the relevant road condition data to the central
server 170for processing and transmission to various user devices
180. In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 may be
configured to be configured to immediately transmit the relevant
road condition data directly to a user device 180. In yet another
embodiment, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to
immediately generate and transmit road condition information
indicative of the detected bump and/or any related road conditions
to the user device 180. In this way, hazardous conditions may be
transmitted in real-time wirelessly to users for immediate updates
regarding road conditions.
Turning now to step 316, the onboard computer 130 is
further configured to perform an end-of-day upload of all captured
road condition data. For example, as noted above, in one
embodiment the onboard computer 130 may be configured to
transmit all captured road condition data to the central server 170C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 38 of 56at the end of work day when a WLAN 2 connection can be
established with the central server. Next, at step 318, post
processing of the captured road condition data is performed by the
central server 170. In certain embodiments, this may include
reformatting the data and associating the captured road condition
data with GPS coordinates and time stamp data to provide context
to the captured road condition data.
Next, at step 320, the central server next performs signature
recognition analyses of the road condition data to determine further
information regarding road conditions. These analyses are
described in greater detail below in regard to the exemplary
method shown in FIG. 4. Finally, at step 322, the central server 170
generates finalized reports and contents for distribution to various
user devices 180. The reports and content may include, but are not
limited to, map data for display on existing digital maps indicating
one or more road conditions (e.g., on Google Maps), reports on the
conditions of roads in certain areas, text messages alerting users to
various road hazards, and the like. In certain embodiments, a report
may be generated where a user may use a viewer to fast forward
through video data to locations where hazardous road conditions
have been identified.
Referring back to step 320 in greater detail, various
embodiments of the central server 170are generally configured for
analyzing road condition data received from the onboard computer
130to identify hazardous road conditions indicated by signatures
in the data. In various embodiments, the central server 170includes
a pattern recognition module for processing the road condition
data. As described in greater detail below, the pattern recognition
module is generally configured for sensing deviations in the road
condition data which may indicate various specific road conditions
or road hazards.
FIG. 4illustrates steps executed by the pattern recognition
module according to one embodiment. Beginning at step 190, the
pattern recognition module identifies and retrieves target road
condition data. For example, in certain embodiments, a user may
request that the central server 170analyze data for a particular area
(e.g.. a geo-fenced area such as a county, city, highway,
neighborhood, or the like) received during a particular time period
(e.g., within the past week). In this case, the pattern recognition
module would review the road condition data it has received from
the onboard computer 130 and identify road condition data
captured at locations within the user-specified area during the user-
specified time period. As will be appreciated from the description
herein, the pattern recognition module may be configured to
retrieve target data relating to any set of user parameters.
Next, at step 200, the pattern recognition module analyzes.
the video data (e.g., the video or image data captured by theC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 39 of 56sensing unit’s optical camera) present in the retrieved road
condition data to identify potential road imperfections. For
example, as the vehicle 110travels along the road 5in FIG. 2, the
video data will show relatively consistent images of the road
surface. However, where potholes, cracks, debris, or other
imperfections are present, the pattern recognition module will
identify these deviations in the image signature and associate them
with road imperfections. If the pattern recognition module detect
imperfections in the road’s surface based on the video data, the
module moves to step 201where the associated data is stored (e.g.,
in the server’s memory storage areas). In addition, at step 201, the
pattern recognition module will determine the location and time of
the captured data associated with the road imperfection and
associate this location/time data with the stored video data for use
in generating images of road imperfections.
Next, at step 202, the pattern recognition module analyzes
the surface profile data (e.g., data captured by the sensing unit’s
road surface scanner) present in the retrieved target road condition
data to identify potential road imperfections. For example, as the
vehicle 110travels along the road 5in FIG. 2, the surface profile
data will indicate a relatively consistent road profile (e.g., a
consistent detected distance from the scanner to the road surface).
However, where the vehicle 110travels over a pothole or piece of
debris in the road, the surface profile data will deviate significantly
and indicate an abnormal surface profile. Accordingly, the pattern
recognition module is configured to identify deviations or
abnormalities in the surface profile data. In addition, the pattern
recognition module may be configured to compare the surface
profile data in the target data with historical surface profile data to
identify changes in the road surface profile over a period of time
(e.g., by comparing earlier surface profile measurements captured
at a particular location with the most recent surface profile
measurement for the particular location to identify surface profile
deviations or abnormalities).
As shown in FIG. 4,if the pattern recognition module does
not detect imperfections in the road’s surface profile based on the
surface profile data, the module moves to step 204. However, if the
pattern recognition module does detect imperfections in the road’s
surface profile, the module moves to step 203where the associated
data is stored (e.g., in the server’s memory storage areas). In
addition, at step 203, the pattern recognition module will determine
the location and time of the captured data associated with the road
imperfection and associate this location/time data with the stored
surface profile data for use in generating graphical representations
of road imperfections.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 40 of 56Next, at step 204, the pattern recognition module analyzes
the vibration data (e.g., data captured by the sensing unit’s
vibration sensor) present in the retrieved target road condition data
to identify potential road imperfections. For example, as a vehicle
110 travels along the road 5in FIG. 2, the vibration data will
indicate relatively consistent road profile (e.g., a consistent
vibration frequency detected as the vehicle 110moves). However.
where the vehicle 110travels over a pothole or piece of debris in
the road, the vibration data will deviate significantly and indicate
an abnormal surface profile (e.g., a sharp change in vibration
frequency or magnitude). Accordingly, the pattern recognition
module is configured to identify deviations or abnormalities in the
vibration data.
As shown in FIG. 4,if the pattern recognition module does
not detect imperfections in the road's surface profile based on the
vibration data, the module moves to step 206. However, if the
pattern recognition module does detect imperfections in the road's
surface profile, the module moves to step 205where the associated
data is stored (e.g., in the server's memory storage areas), In
addition, at step 205, the pattern recognition module will again
determine the location and time of the captured data associated
with the road imperfection and associate this location/time data
with the stored vibration data for use in generating graphical
representations of road imperfections.
Next, at step 206, the pattern recognition module analyzes
the illumination level data (e.g., data captured by the sensing unit's
optical camera) present in the retrieved target road condition data
to identify potential low illumination sections of road. For
example, as a vehicle 110travels along the road 5in FIG. 2, the
illumination level data will indicate relatively consistent
illumination (e.g., either a consistent day- light luminous intensity
or, during the night, a consistent artificial light luminous intensity).
However, where the vehicle 110travels on a portion of road where
a street light is out - or that is otherwise poorly lit - the illumination
level data will deviate significantly and indicate an abnormal
illumination level (e.g., a sharp change in illumination intensity).
Accordingly, the pattern recognition module is configured to
identify deviations or abnormalities in the illumination level data.
In addition, the pattern recognition module may be configured to
compare the illumination level data in the target data with
historical illumination level data to identify changes in illumination
levels over a period of time (e.g., by comparing earlier illumination
level measurements captured at a particular location at a particular
time of day with the most recent illumination level measurement
for the particular location at the particular time of day to identifyC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 41 of 56illumination level deviations or abnormalities).
As shown in FIG. 4, if the pattern recognition module does
not detect low illumination levels based on the illumination level
data, the module moves to step 208. However, if the pattern
recognition module does detect low illumination levels, the module
moves to step 207where the associated data is stored (e.g., in the
server's memory storage areas). In addition, at step 207, the pattern
recognition module will again determine the location and time of
the captured data associated with the low illumination levels an
associate this location/time data with the stored illumination level
data for use in generating graphical representations road
imperfections.
Next, at step 208, the pattern recognition module generates
a graphical representation of various road condition indicated by
the target road condition data. For example, in one embodiment,
the graphical representation may comprise an interactive road map
showing the location of potential road imperfections (e.g., potholes
or debris) and low illumination areas (e.g., where a street or tunnel
light is out). In this way, a user is able to view road conditions
existing within the parameters set for the target data (e.g., hazards
within a particular area and/or time period). In addition, the
interactive road map may be configured to automatically match
before and after images and/or data regarding particular condition
so the user is provided with comparative information about the
current and prior state of the condition. For example, in one
embodiment, a user may select a particular road hazard on the map
and the pattern recognition module will retrieve the most recent
image of the hazard (e.g., an image of a pothole captured by the
optical camera) and next most recent image of the hazard (e.g., an
earlier image of the same location before pot hole was formed).
As will be appreciated from the description herein, various
embodiments of the pattern recognition module may be configured
to analyze additional road condition data to identify other road
conditions. For example, as noted above, the sensing unit 121may
be configured to capture reflectivity data indicative of the
reflection coefficient of a road surface. As such, the pattern
recognition module may be configured to analyze any captured
reflectivity data and identify data indicating an abnormal
reflectivity (e.g., where the road is wet or icy). Additionally, the
pattern recognition module may be configured to similarly analyze
infrared data (e.g. to identify iced roads) and noise data (e.g., to
identify debris or road imperfections). Furthermore, the pattern
recognition module may be configured to show conditions
indicated by this additional data on any generated graphicalC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 42 of 56representations, such as the interactive map noted above. The
pattern recognition system may also be configured to identify
additional conditions indicated by the road condition data. For
example, in certain embodiments, the illumination level data and
reflectivity data may be used to indicate weather conditions in a
particular area (e.g., sunny, cloudy, raining, etc.). In addition, the
condition of painted lines on roads (e.g., lane markers) may be
evaluated based on captured video data, reflectivity data, or the like
(e.g., to determine whether painted lines are weathered and need to
be repainted).
In various embodiments, the pattern recognition module
may also be configured to use the hazards or conditions to
calculate a road condition index representing a relative hazard level
for a particular road or area. For example, in certain embodiments,
the road condition index may be calculated using a predetermined
function of the number of identified hazards occurring over a given
length of road and/or the illumination level over a given length of
road. In further embodiments, the predetermined function for
calculating the road condition index may take into account the
severity of the identified hazards. For example, in various
embodiments, a deep pot hole indicated by surface profile data
may be weighted more heavily in the road condition index
calculation than a light bump indicated by the vibration data. In
certain embodiments, the sensor array may also be configured to
direct certain optical cameras towards road signs or mile markers
and captures images indicating where other associated road
condition data is being captured.
Use of Road Condition Sensor Arrays in Vehicle Fleet
According to various embodiments, the road condition
detection system 100 may be adapted for use with a fleet of
vehicles in order to provide comprehensive road condition updates.
The vehicle fleet may be, for example, that of a freight or mail
carrier (e.g., the United States Postal Service or United Parcel
Service, Inc.), a public transportation provider (e.g., city buses
and/or taxis), or one or more rental car agencies. In such
embodiments, road condition sensor arrays 120 are provided on
numerous vehicles in the fleet and configured to transmit captured
road condition data to the central server 170. In this way, road
condition data indicative of all roads on which the equipped
vehicles travel can be collected and analyzed by the central server
170(e.g., using the methods described above). By providing roads
condition sensor arrays on one or more large vehicle fleets, road
condition data may be captured and analyzed to indicate road
conditions over a wide area.C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 43 of 56In embodiments where the central server 170receives large
amounts of road condition data from road condition sensor arrays
120in a vehicle fleet, the server’s pattern recognition module may
be configured to repeat steps 202-208 for all received road
condition data in order to continuously identify potential road
hazards. In various embodiments, information about identified road
conditions may be communicated to the Department of
Transportation, local media outlets, online road condition services,
directly to user devices 180, and/or stored by server 170. In
addition, the pattern recognition module may be further configured
to continuously update the above-described interactive map (e.g.,
by periodic updates in accordance with the transmission of road
condition data from the onboard computers 130to the server 170
and by immediate “alert” updates in the scenarios noted above).
This updated, global interactive road map may also include
calculated road condition indexes.
In various embodiments, the global interactive map may be
made accessible via a website or other remote application such that
it can be accessed via the network 150 and viewed one a remote
personal computer, smart phone, or other device. In this way, the
interactive map can be accessed and viewed by drivers,
government agencies, and others interested in updates on the status
of potential road hazards. In further embodiments, the central
server 170may be configured for indicating potential road hazards
on other map-based systems, such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, or
Apple Maps. As noted above, the road condition information
provided in this way may be used to plan road repairs, salting,
other road maintenance, as well as to provide status updates for
commuters in order to avoid traffic and potential vehicle damage.
CONCLUSION
As will be appreciated from the description herein, the
components and operation of the road condition detection system
100 may be modified according to various embodiments. For
example, various sensing devices may be employed in the road
condition sensor array’s sensing unit 121 to capture a variety of
road condition data. In addition, the central server 170 may be
configured accordingly to identify various hazards and other
conditions based on the captured road condition data using various
methods or algorithms. Moreover, according to various
embodiments, the road condition data may be processed as
described herein by the central server 170, the onboard computer
130, any other suitable computing device, or some combination
thereof.

32. Mr. Rana, learned Counsel for the appellant, points out the
following features of distinction, between the invention in the suit
patent and D-2:
S.No. Feature of the suit patent Feature of the prior art D-2

vehicle.

7 No such feature. Road anomalies are classified

33. While the subject matter of D-2 is also a system mounted on the
vehicle to track road anomalies, Mr. Rana submits that the above
features are unique to the subject patent and cannot be said to be either
anticipated or obvious from D-2. A person skilled in the art would
not, he submits, be able to arrive at the invention in the subject patent
from the teachings in the suit patent without hindsight knowledge.
Mr. Rana submits that, in assessing whether the later patent would be
obvious or anticipated from the earlier patent, the Court is required, as
per the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffmann
La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd2, to
(i) identify a person ordinarily skilled in the art,
(ii) identify the inventive concept embodied in the patent,
22015 SCC OnLine Del 13619C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 49 of 56(iii) impute, to the normally skilled but unimaginative
ordinary person skilled in the art what was common general
knowledge in the art at the priority date,
(iv) identify the differences between the matter cited and the
alleged invention and ascertain whether the differences are
merely workshop improvements or actually involve inventive
steps,
(v) determine whether the differences would be obvious to a
person skilled in the art without having to adopt a hindsight
approach.
Viewed thus, Mr. Rana submits that it cannot be said that the subject
patent has no inventive step vis-à-vis D-2.
Analysis
34. When one reads the complete specifications in D-2 vis-à-vis the
principal features of the subject patent which are claimed to be
inventive, the conclusion is inevitable that all the said features are
already expressly envisioned in the complete specifications in D-2.
For ready reference, and at the cost of repetition, the following
extracts from the complete specifications in D-2 may be noted:
(i) “According to various embodiments, a road condition
detection system is provided for capturing data indicative of
road conditions and analysing the captured data to locate and
identify various road conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as
potholes, or weather conditions, such as ice). In variousC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 50 of 56embodiments, the road condition detection system comprises a
road condition sensor array configured for being attached to a
vehicle and for capturing road condition data, an onboard
computer for analysing the road condition data in real time and
transmitting information regarding road conditions to remote
users of the system, and a central data analysis server
configured for conducting post processing analysis of the data
collected by the road condition sensor array to determine
additional information about various road conditions.”
(ii) “In various embodiments, the road sensor array is
configured to sense and record information about a given road
as the vehicle travels along the road. For example, the road
condition sensor array may include an optical camera, a
vibration sensor, a road surface scanner, and various other
devices configured to capture road condition data indicative of
various road condition attributes…”
(iii) “The road condition sensor array may also include, or
may be in communication with, a geo-location device, allowing
the system to geo-code the location of road condition data
indicative of these attributes.”
(iv) “As described in greater detail below, the road condition
data captured by the road condition sensor array may be
analysed by the onboard computer in order to identify various
road conditions based on the road condition data… In addition,C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 51 of 56the road condition data may be analysed further by the Central
server to identify additional road conditions. … In addition, the
central data analysis server may be configured to create data
applied to maps indicating various road conditions (e.g. layers
applied to digital maps), calculate a road condition index for
individual roads or areas, and compare changes in road
conditions for particular roads or locations. The analysis
performed by the Central server may be useful, for example, in
identifying and communicating road conditions to drivers and
for evaluation of road repairs and maintenance.”
(v) “Fig. 1 shows a road condition detection system,
according to one embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment,
the road condition detection system generally comprises a road
condition sensor array mounted on the vehicle, an on-board
computer, and the central data analysis server (herein “central
server”). As discussed in greater detail below, the on-board
computer is configured to communicate with the road condition
sensor array in order to control the capture and storage of road
condition data. The on board computer is further configured to
communicate with the central server via a communication
network in order to transmit road condition data to the server
for analysis. Additionally, the central server and on-board
computer may be configured to communicate with one or more
user devices (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet computer, digital
information acquisition device, or the like) to provide updated
road condition data to the user.”C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 52 of 56(vi) “Fig. 2 shows a road condition sensor array mounted on
the vehicle according to one embodiment. … According to
various embodiments, the front sensing unit comprises various
road to make detection devices, including an optical camera, a
vibration sensor and a road surface scanner. As the vehicle
drives along a road, the road condition sensor arrays sensing
unit captures road condition data relating to the conditions of
the road. For example, the captured road condition data
may0020include video data, surface profile data, illumination
level data, vibration data, and other data generated by other
devices in the sensing unit.”
(vii) “… For example, in one embodiment, the optical camera
may be configured to capture video of the road surface
continuously as the vehicle travels. In such embodiments, the
on-board computer may continuously store video data generated
by the optical camera and may be configured to buffer and
transmit data to a user device.”
(viii) “In various other embodiments, the sensing units and
mounting housings may be provided at any suitable location on
the vehicle depending on its configuration and intended use.”
(ix) “In the illustrated embodiment, the on-board computer is
generally configured to communicate with the road condition
sensor arrays sensing units in order to (i) control when theC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 53 of 56sensing units capture road condition data, (ii) store the road
condition data captured by the sensing units, and (iii) transmit
the stored road condition data to the central server and/or the
user device. For example, in one embodiment, the on-board
computer courses the sensing units to capture road condition
data continuously as the vehicle travels.”
(x) “In various embodiments, the road condition data
captured by the road condition sensor array may be stored in the
on-board computer (e.g., in the computer’s memory storage
devices). For example, in certain embodiments, the on-board
computer is configured to store road condition data collected by
the road condition sensor array continuously as it is captured.
In other embodiments, the on-board computer is configured to
store road condition data collected by the road condition sensor
array only if the on-board computer detects a deviation in the
road condition data that may indicate the presence of a road
hazard…”
35. So comprehensive, indeed, are the complete specifications of
the D-2 patent that reference to further extracts therefrom is hardly
necessary. A reading of the complete specifications indicates that the
D-2 patent has envisioned a system for detecting road anomalies
which is largely similar to that envisioned by the subject patent. The
principle of a camera capturing road anomalies, which may be an
audio or video camera, and which may capture anomalies in the road
as the vehicle travels; the principle of the system being mounted onC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 54 of 56one vehicle, vis-à-vis a multitude of vehicles; the transmission of the
data captured by the camera/sensor array to the on-board computer;
the diverse possibilities of the data being stored on real-time basis, vis-
à-vis the data being stored on a backup platform so as to have access
to historical data regarding the road; geo-profiling of the road, road
conditions, and the network of roads; transmission of the data to a
central server which would, either on real-time basis or on the basis of
historical data, chart the anomalies in various roads; and final
transmission of the data to the users so as to provide information
regarding road anomalies and take remedial steps where necessary, are
all fully and completely contemplated, captured and visualised by the
D-2 patent. The possibility of various embodiments, in which the
specifics of the various features of the system for tracking road
anomalies may vary, and the specific varied features are all envisaged
by the D-2 patent.
36. The aspect of obviousness, vis-à-vis prior art, has, unlike the
trade mark regime, to be assessed from the point of view of a person
skilled in the art who is possessed of common general knowledge as it
exists on the priority date of the prior art, but who is not expected to
exercise any imaginative faculties. The authority, or the Court,
assessing the aspect of validity of the later patent in view of the
teachings contained in the earlier patent, has to reasonably assess
whether a person skilled in the art would, or would not, be able to
arrive at the later patent from the teachings in the complete
specifications of the earlier patent. Absolute identity of the
specifications in the two patents is not what is required. What isC.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 55 of 56needed is sufficiency of guidance or teaching in the specifications of
the earlier patent which, when coupled with the object sought to be
achieved by the later patent, would arm a person skilled in the art,
possessed of ordinary general knowledge as it existed on the priority
date of the earlier patent, to arrive at the later patent. While trademark
infringement is examined from the point of view of a person of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the person, from
whose point of view the aspect of patent infringement is to be
examined, or from whose point of view the aspect of obviousness of
the later patent from the earlier patent is to be assessed, is a person
who is neither of average intelligence nor suffers from any
imperfection in recollection. He is a person who is skilled in the art
and is, therefore, vis-à-vis the art concerned, possessed of the
necessary intelligence and skill as is expected of a person dealing in
such matters.
37. The impugned order of the Assistant Controller has extracted
certain observations from Order 250/2012 dated 2 November 2012
passed by the IPAB, which read:
“Once the very subject-matter of the invention has been disclosed
by the prior art… the person skilled in the art is assumed to be
willing to make trial and error experiments to get it to work…”
(The person) is not a person of exceptional skill and; knowledge…
He must, however, be prepared to display a reasonable degree of
skill and common knowledge of the art in making trials…”
On the aspect of obviousness, the following observations of the IPAB
had been relied upon by the Assistant Controller:
“When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a the
problem and (there they) are a finite number of identified,C.A.(COMM.IPD-PAT) 3/2021 Page 56 of 56predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill in the art has as
good reason to pursue the known options within his or her
technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely
the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common
sense…”
To my mind, these observations correctly encapsulate the principle of
obviousness, and the indicia of an inventive step, vis-à-vis prior art, as
a requirement of a valid patent.
38. Given the weight and amplitude of the teachings in the
complete specifications of the D-2 patent, I find no reason to differ
with the decision of the Assistant Controller, insofar as it holds that
the subject patent is invalid on the ground of obviousness and lack of
inventive step, when compared with the prior art D-2.
Conclusion
39. For all the aforesaid reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed.

1. The appellant submitted Application No. 202011011938 dated 19 March 2020 for grant of a patent in respect of an invention titled a method and system for detecting road anomalies (hereinafter the subject patent).  The application stands rejected by the Controller of Patents and Designs (the Controller) vide order dated 8 January 2021 passed under Section 15 of the Patents Act, 1970.  The appellant is in appeal against the said order.  

2. The impugned order rejects the application on the ground that the claim in the application suffers from want of inventive step vis-a-vis prior art D-2.  Though the First Examination Report (FER) dated 15 June 2020 cites four prior art documents D-1 to D-4 as disclosing all the features of the claims in the subject patent, the notice of personal hearing, issued consequent to the reply filed by the appellant to the FER, restricted the allegation of lack of inventive step to comparison of the subject patent with the prior art D-1 to D-3 and the final impugned order holds the subject patent to be lacking an inventive step only vis-a-vis the prior art D-2.  

3. I may note that this position was accepted by both sides and arguments were also advanced before me, on the aspect of obviousness and inventive subject in the subject patent vis-a-vis the prior art D-2.  

4. The Court is only required, therefore, to examine whether the subject patent is lacking an inventive step vis-a-vis D-2; in other words, whether the distinguishing features of the subject patent would be obvious to a person skilled in the art from the disclosures contained in D-2 and, therefore, whether the impugned order is correct in rejecting the appellants application on the ground of lack of inventive step.

5. For this, one has to appreciate the essential features of the suit patent, which are claimed, by the appellant, to be inventive.

3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION

The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[001] 	The present invention relates to transportation management information system.  More particularly, it relates to a system and method to maintain the heavily travelled roadways.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[002] 	In the recent years, with exponential increase in traffic on the roads, there is lot of pressure on continuous upkeep and maintenance of the road networks across the cities. Road authorities are losing the continuous battle for upkeep of the road because of frequent weather change, improper drainage, improper or inadequate repair work, improper design of the road, frequent cutting of the roads for laying cables and conduits, heavy traffic or heavy vehicles plying on the roads which are not designed to handle such loads. As a result, road imperfections develop continuously and need to be managed before they become dangerous.

[003] 	Road anomaly may be defined as misalignment in the road surface due to any cut or crack in the road due to cable laying or any pothole due to improper water drainage or some 20 bump or uneven level due to manhole cover which leads to sudden braking or turning of the vehicle as soon as driver tries to negotiate the anomaly or sometimes if the driver is not able to negotiate then it leads sudden jerk in the vehicle.

[004] 	In both the above situations either vehicle damage could happen, or accident can occur due to sudden application of brakes or turning of the vehicle. In some cases, skidding of the vehicle because of sudden braking or turning over has led to fatalities. Hence, it becomes utmost important to continuously monitor the road surface condition for anomaly and make sure that the road condition should not become worse to cause accident or unfit for driving. Also, the roads can be maintained better if the anomalies are detected and fixed in the early stages due to less cost of preventive maintenance as compared to rehabilitation or upgrading or reconstruction of the roads.

[005] 	Further, USA patent US9863928 B1 discloses a road condition detection system for identifying and monitoring road conditions, and for communicating information regarding road conditions to various users. The road condition detection system is provided for capturing data indicative of road conditions and analyzing the captured data to locate and identify various road conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as potholes, or weather conditions, such as ice). In various embodiments, the road condition detection system includes a road condition sensor array configured for being attached to a vehicle and for capturing road condition data. The captured data may be transmitted and assessed by a server configured for identifying potential road hazards or other road conditions based on the road condition data captured by the sensor array. The prior art discloses a system based on laser and vibration sensors. The system however, does not detect the severity of the road condition. 

[006] 	Another USA patent US20180068495A1 discloses a method of detecting and identifying road surface defects is provided. Motion and position information is received from a plurality of vehicles. A profile is retrieved for a particular vehicle from a database of vehicle profiles by using an identifier of the particular vehicle. One or more criteria are identified for detecting a particular type of road surface defect based on the retrieved profile of the particular vehicle. Upon determining that the received motion and position data satisfies the identified criteria, a detection of a road surface defect of the particular type and a location associated with the detected road surface defect based on the received position information is reported. The prior art discloses method of detecting the road conditions using motion sensors and accelerometer. The method disclosed in prior art is cost intensive as multiple vehicle types and their sensor data has to be correlated based on their weight, tyre size, dimensions etc. 

[007] 	Nowadays, various methods and systems are available based on the technologies related to sensors and laser. These methods and systems have limitations due to vibration-based sensors and high costing of laser scanning. Also, the laser sensor is not efficient in wet weather and narrow roads. Due to these limitations there is a need of cost effective method and system for detecting the road anomalies.

OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION

[008] 	The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a method and system to give prior warning to the subscribed driver or user for upcoming road issues.

[009] 	Another objective of the present invention is to provide a cost-effective method and system for better surveillance of road condition.

[0010] 	   Yet another objective of the present invention is to automate the measurement of road condition.

[0011] 	    Yet another objective of present invention is to provide safe driving assistance to its subscribed users.

 [0012]    Another objective of the present invention is to provide a proactive system and a method to report road anomalies regularly.

[0013]      Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a method and for periodic tracking of the road conditions which may help in accessing the quality of re-carpeting or patch work done.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

[0014] 	   The present invention proposes a system for tracking the road anomalies through a dashcam mounted on plurality of vehicles. The method and system maps and identifies the road anomalies by analyzing the video of road conditions and classify the road anomalies by earmarking the road anomalies into potholes, bumps, cracks, etc. and rating them into yellow, amber and red colors based on certain parameters like dimensions of anomalies, type of anomaly, type of road on which anomaly has happened(highway, main city road,  colony road, service road, etc.), GPS co-ordinates, date time stamp when the anomaly has been reported, changes if any since first time the anomaly has been reported, area to which the location belongs (sector, area, wards, zones, sub-district, tehsil/taluka, etc.).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0020] The following presents a simplified description of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This description is not an extensive overview of the present invention. It is not intended to identify the key/critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concept of the invention in a simplified form.

[0021]     Accordingly, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various changes and modifications of the embodiments described herein can be made without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, descriptions of well-known functions and constructions are omitted for clarity and conciseness

[0022]      Features that are described and/or illustrated with respect to one embodiment may be used in the same way or in a similar way in one or more other embodiments and/or in combination with or instead of the features of the other embodiments.

[0023]      The terms and words used in the following description and claims are not limited to the bibliographical meanings, but, are merely used to enable a clear and consistent understanding of the invention. Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention.


[0024]     It is to be understood that the singular forms a, an, and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

[0025] It should be emphasized that the term comprises/comprising when used in this specification is taken to specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps or components but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof. The equations used in the specification are only for computation purpose.

 [0026]      In accordance with the present invention, Fig. 1 shows system for detecting road anomalies. The various components of the system for detecting road anomalies are, data capturing unit (100), data recording unit (200), data processing unit (300), data mapping unit (400) and data publishing unit (500):

-Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit (100 and 200) may comprise a High Definition dash board camera mounted on top of a vehicle, which is driven at a speed of 20-30 km/hour at a pre-decided route set by the user. The dashboard camera may be mounted on front or back of the vehicle, pointing towards the road surface to capture video of the road surface. As the vehicle moves, the camera continuously records the road conditions through its lenses, covering a 130-degree view. The cameras provide a high definition view of the road surface and simultaneously the GPS data is recorded by the GPS data recording unit (200). Once the survey is done by the camera, the camera footage and GPS log files (.GPX) are downloaded to a central computer to compute the same.

 Data Processing Unit (300) may comprise of the central system to process the raw videos and identify and classify the road anomalies based on training dataset of the road anomalies. This process also helps in classifying the severity of the road anomaly data and notifying the road authorities and subscribed drivers in case of potential issues. This process also gets the input of the GPS data like the deceleration in speed at a particular spot or patch of the road.

 Data Mapping and Publishing Unit (400 and 500) may comprise the geographical mapping of road anomalies, creation of anomalies database and its updation based on road survey conducted, plotting of the road anomalies on any available web mapping service based on the route selected by the drivers along with the name of the roads featuring distress spots and suggesting alternate route with their anomalies information. Further, the report generates a map plotting the exact spots of road distress with color coding based on severity of road anomalies on the web map and create a heat map to show the concentration of road anomalies in the area or zone. This helps both the road authorities to take necessary actions on preventive maintenance and the subscribed drivers take the conscious decision on choosing the appropriate route.

[0027]   Fig. 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the functioning of data capturing unit (100) for detecting the road anomalies. The data capturing unit (100) comprises a dashboard camera (Dashcam), a Global Positioning System (GPS) and a storage device. The Dashcam is a video camera with high definition 1080p, 130 degree viewing angle covering all lanes of the road, Wide Dynamic range (WDR) function which adjusts according to the ambient light, built in G-sensor for image stabilization in case of shock or jerk. The Dash cam may be but not limited to, Akaso dash cam C330. Dashcam records the videos of the roads to  analyses the road anomalies.

[0028]     In an embodiment, the dashboard camera and GPS may be combined. 

[0029] Further, Dashboard camera may pair with a communication device through available network to transfer data to the mobile application. Afterwards, the data from mobile application can be transferred to central server through any network. Alternatively, the data may be physically transferred to central server via storage device such as Secure Digital (SD) card.

[0030]    The GPS data recording unit (200) or a GPS logger is a device which is used to capture the GPS co-ordinates and create a stream of it so that once the whole route is recorded the data can be used to trace the vehicles path on the map, the date time stamp and the speed at which the vehicle has traversed the route. The GPS logger may comprise of GPS receiver, a processing and storage unit. In an exemplary embodiment, U-blox7 GPS Receiver, a Raspberry PI model 4 B and 16 GB SD card for recording the stream of GPS co-ordinates are used. The data recorded from GPS logger is stored as .GPX file. With every
track being recorded as a .GPX file it is easy to play it in GPX player software which plays the recorded location position along with date time stamp and the speed. The captured .GPX files can be uploaded from Raspberry PI to central server through SSH protocol in a secure manner for processing at the central server. The GPS logger will help create a trace of the route travelled by the vehicle used for road survey. The GPS co-ordinates of potholes and patches are identified and mapped to identify the accurate position of road issues.

[0031]   Further, the data capturing unit (100) installed on plurality of vehicles to capture the video and GPS data. Vehicles may be but not limited to, any utility vehicle deployed by municipal committees, personal cars, or commercial vehicles such as trucks, buses etc. but preferably plying during the less traffic time in the morning when shadows are less prevalent. 

[0032]    Fig. 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) illustrate the process of classification of road anomalies and mapping of road anomalies on to a web mapping service application. 

 [0033]     As shown in Figure 3(a), the central server is a high end desktop machine which process the data captured by data capturing unit (100). In an exemplary embodiment, a desktop machine with Intel i7 processor, Nvidia GPU, atleast 16-32 GB RAM, 512 SSD is used. The central server runs an Artificial Intelligence based algorithm to identify the road anomaly based on the trained dataset of road anomalies. Training data set categorize anomalies in different categories such as potholes, cracks, scrapped road, bumps, misalignments of manhole covers and frames. Further, the server classify the quality of roads as fair, bad or worse and determine the right speed to cross over the anomalies based on recent driver experience. It also determines the alternate travel path for users to avoid travelling over a road having anomalies.

[0034]     Further, as shown in figure 3(b) and 3(c), the video is processed through the data processing unit (300) to detect the road anomalies. After processing the video, image frames are recorded having bounding box corresponding to the detected anomalies along with date and time stamp. A bounding box is an imaginary box to demarcate the objects from their surroundings. In digital image processing, the bounding box is merely the coordinates of the rectangular border that fully encloses a digital image when it is placed over a page, a canvas, a screen or other similar bi-dimensional background. Based on the dimensions of the anomalies and the data of deceleration on location of the road anomaly, the road anomaly is classified into fair (yellow), bad (amber) or worse (red). If there are multiple road anomalies in the particular stretch of the road the whole patch may be marked as bad or worse.


[0035]   The data mapping unit (400) classifies and labels the road condition by creating a map of road including road anomalies and provide the average deceleration in speed to negotiate the road anomaly. While the driver sees the different routes on the map for reaching the destination the driver may also choose to select the route which has less road anomalies.

[0036]    In accordance with the present invention the method for detecting road anomalies is discussed herein:

Step 1: Installation of the dashboard camera and GPS logger in the vehicle;

Step 2: Starting the dashboard camera and GPS logger simultaneously when the vehicle starts surveying the road;

Step 3: Dashboard camera will record the road condition and GPS logger will start capturing the distance covered, time taken and speed at each point and creates GPS log file (.GPX file).

Step 4: The data captured through dashboard camera and GPS logger is stored in separate local storage device.

Step 5: The Data stored in the local storage device is transferred to data processing unit (300).

Step 6: The video is processed through the data processing unit (300) to detect the road anomalies and create a bounding box and capture the image frame along date and time stamp.

Step 7: The data timestamp of image obtained from the (.GPX file) with road anomaly is compared with the corresponding time stamp through GPS logger and the GPS co-ordinates of the road anomalies based on corresponding GPS time stamp are determined.

Step 8: The road anomaly is further geotagged as red or amber or yellow to bring to the attention of the user about the condition and severity of the anomaly on web
mapping application using the GPS coordinates which will show up as pin on map.

Step 9: The said user can click on the pin to see the actual image of the road anomaly with the date time stamp. User will be able to see the severity of the anomaly and average speed for the patch based on drivers travelling at off peak hours.

Step10: There might be a date time stamp based and area wise heat map created to segregate the different areas where there are more anomalies as compared to other areas.

[0037]    Step 1 to 5 facilitate the data capturing of required data. Step 6-7 is related to the process of detecting of road anomalies. Step 8 is based on mapping of road anomalies on the web mapping service application. Steps 9-10 are facilitating the publishing of road anomalies to be detected by the users.

[0038]    In accordance with the present invention the said process for classification of the road anomaly and determining its severity and accordingly determining the speed of vehicle on the same road is discussed herein:

* The severity of the road anomaly is classified based on correlation of the video of the road labelled through data mapping system, exact geotagging of the location and average decelaration of speed during off peak traffic on the same spot. 

* Tagging of road anomalies in different color scheme like red or amber or yellow to bring to the attention of the road authorities about the severity of the anomaly, so that the prioritizing and planning of repair work by authorities can be carried out. 

* Historical analysis of the deceleration of the speed through the same location where the anomaly is detected.

* Informing the user in advance about the severity of the road anomaly and the average speed for that patch of road.

[0039]    The process of classification of the road anomaly and determining its severity and the amount of deceleration of speed from the average speed on the same road is a continuous and iterative process which will keep on geotagging the new spots or changing the colors and removing the geotags if the road is re-surfaced or patch work done.

[0040]    In accordance with the present invention FIG. 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the process of publishing of road anomalies to users. 

 a) Process for visualization of the road conditions based on specific area includes:

* Collecting and processing the data of road anomalies for a particular area for a period of every 10-15 days to show the variation in data over a period of time.

* Geographically color code the sub areas within area based on number of anomalies and their severity.

b) Process for identifying the route, automatic downloading of the road anomalies data for the route and providing the suggestions if the road quality is really worse consists the following:

* User switches on the web mapping service application and selects the destination and presses start.

* System identifies the current location and the destination location and selects the best route.

* System downloads the road anomalies data for the route from the current database of road anomalies and shows it visually to the subscribed driver on web mapping service application.

* The driver is given warning of the upcoming road anomaly based on its severity and subscribed drivers speed (only on mobile application).  The system also tells about the average speed at which driver should cross the particular patch of road based on past few days data for off peak traffic.

c) Process of warning the driver (only on mobile application) in case the upcoming road anomaly is severe or driver is at higher speed as compared to average speed in off peak hour includes:

* Subscribed users speed is calculated based on GPS logger installed and route is detected.

* The route currently being undertaken is compared against road anomalys database and the average speed for past few days for off peak hour.

* Driver is given audio warning if the drivers speed is much higher for approaching anomaly.

[0041] 	    The method of publishing the information about upcoming road anomalies may give visual and audio alert to subscribed user in case the driver is at higher speed then prescribed speed for the respective patch.

[0042]     In accordance with the present invention the advantages offered by the present invention are:

* Enabling easy survey of roads for locating distress spots, requiring minimal human involvement.

* Leveraging technology to efficiently cover a large area within the monitoring framework within less time.

* Leveraging technology to capture any other incident along the streets like dumping of construction waste, spilling of waste, collection of water, etc.

* Enabling report generation that details out the near-exact location of the potholes and other distress spots on the scanned roads, thus making it convenient for the city authorities to identify the locations as well as assess the distress severity, and accordingly take prompt action.

* The present invention uses a dashcam a specialized camera having wide angle of 130 degree, G sensor for image stabilization for capturing road conditions and subsequent video analysis through AI algorithm for detecting and classifying the road conditions and correlating with the data on deceleration in speed from multitude of vehicles at the same spot on the road irrespective of traffic condition and other adverse conditions for further classifying the road conditions. The present invention does all the processing centrally and focuses on analysis of pothole and road surface anomalies.


[0043]    While this invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments, but, on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.

7. One may simplify the features of the subject patent as they emerged from the complete specifications reproduced (supra), thus:

(i)	The subject patent is intended to detect road anomalies.  The expression road anomalies is a compendious term covering any defect in road surface, owing to any cut and crack in the road, pothole, bump or uneven level, which would require a driver driving on the road, to suddenly brake or turn the vehicle or if he does not do so, to a sudden jerk in the vehicle.  As this can result in accident, mapping of road anomalies is necessary, both for notifying the concerned authorities, who can rectify the roads as well as to inform subscribed drivers of such anomalies, so that they can negotiate the vehicle appropriately or choose roads, which are more easily negotiable. 
 
8. Five objectives of the claimed inventions are identified, viz. 

(a)	Providing a method and system to give prior warning to a subscribed driver or user of upcoming road issues, (b) providing a cost effective method and system for better surveillance of road condition, (c) automating measurements of road condition, (d) providing safe driving assistance to subscribed users, (e) providing a proactive system and a method to report road anomalies regularly and (f) providing a method for periodic tracking of road conditions.

9. The method claimed in the subject patent, when adopted, fulfils two purposes.  Firstly, it analyzes the video of the road so as to map the conditions of the road.  Secondly, it classifies road anomalies by earmarking them on the basis of the type of anomaly and rating the anomaly as yellow, amber or red, based on pre-determined parameters.  Thirdly, the complete specifications are accompanied by drawings, designated as figures 1, 2(a), 2(b), 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 4, 5 and 6.  These drawings, followed four steps:

(a)	Detection of the anomalies by a Data Capturing Unit,
(b)	Classification of the anomalies,
(c)	Mapping of the anomalies,
(d)	Publication of the data to users

     I may note, here, that when one peruses Claims 1 to 8 in the suit patent  already reproduced (supra)  it is clear that fourth step noted hereinabove, i.e. publication of the data to users is not part of the claims in the subject patent.

10. The claimed invention is divided in complete specifications, into:
(a) 	Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit,
(b)	Data Processing Unit and
(c)	Data Mapping and Publishing Unit.

11. The Data Capturing and Data Recording Unit comprises the following features:

(a)	The unit has:
	(i)	a camera, 
	(ii)	a Global Positioning System (GPS) and 
	(iii)	a storage device.

(b)	The camera has 
     (i)	a WDR function which adjusts to ambient light
(ii)	a G  sensor for image stabilisation in the case of jerk.  
(iii)	The camera is a high definition dashboard camera mounted atop the vehicle at the front or the rear.  It points towards the surface of the road.  It has a 130 degree viewing lens. It can be mounted at a multitude of the vehicles.
       
12. The vehicle is to be driven at a speed of 20 to 30 kilometre per hour at a pre-decided route set by the user.  As the vehicle moves, the camera records a video of the entire road surface, including any anomaly in the road covering of 130 degree view.

13. The GPS data of the road is simultaneously recorded on the GPS recording unit. 

14. The GPS Data Recording Unit  (hereinafter the GPS DRU)  alternatively called the GPS logger - consists of a GPS receiver and a processing/storing unit.  

15. The GPS DRU captures the GPS coordinates of the road and creates a stream so that it is possible to trace the path of the vehicle, the date time stamp and the speed of the vehicle.

16. The data is stored as a .GPX file, which can easily be played using GPX player software which, when played, would identify the position of the vehicle, date and time stamp and the speed. 

17. Thus, the GPS DRU identifies anomalies and maps them so that accurate locations are identified.  

18. The camera footage and the GPS log files (in .GPX format) are downloaded to a central computer. 

19. Alternatively, the camera may be paired with a mobile through a mobile application, and the mobile can send the data to the central server. Again, alternatively, the video recording recorded by the camera can be physically transferred to the central server through a Secure Digital (SD) Card. 

20. The Data Process Unit consists of a central server, which is a desktop machine that processes the data captured by the camera and the GPS DRU and mapped by the GPS DRU.

21. The central server identifies road anomalies based on a dataset.  The trained dataset classifies the anomalies into various categories such as potholes, cracks, scrapped road, bumps, misalignments of manhole covers, and the like. 

22. The central server thereafter classifies the road, based on the nature of anomalies contained therein as fair (yellow), bad (amber) or worse (red) and, thereby, identifies the quality of road by colour coding. 

23. Based on this data, the central server determines the speed at which the anomaly is to be negotiated, based on recent driving experience and also suggests alternate travel path which could be adopted. 

24. The data mapping and publishing unit does the following function:

(a) It geographically maps the road anomaly. 
(b) It creates an anomalies database which is updated from time to time based on surveys.
(c) It plots the road anomalies on a web mapping service, depending on the route selected by the user. 
(d) The road anomalies thus plotted identified the name of the road as well as colour coded distress spots on the road.
(e) It suggests alternative routes which can be adopted.  

25.  As such, the data mapping and publishing unit creates a heat map which identifies concentration of road anomalies on various roads. This serves two functions. It helps authorities to repair the roads and correct the anomalies and also helps subscribed drivers to negotiate the anomalies and select alternate routes. 

26. Thus, the entire method claimed in the subject patent involves

(a) Classification of the road anomaly, by co-relating the video of the road labelled through the data mapping system, exact geo tagging of the anomaly and average deceleration of speed while negotiating the anomaly.
(b) Tagging of the road anomalies in colour coded fashion so as to inform the authorities about the severities of the anomalies and enable them to prioritize and plan repair work.
(c) Conducting historical analysis of the deceleration through the location where the anomaly is detected and
(d) Informing subscribed users in advance of the existence and severity of road anomalies.

27. The specifications clarified that the aforesaid process is continuous and iterative so that that new spots are continuously geo-tagged, anomalies specific colours are changed from time to time and, if the road is re-surfaced or patch work is done, geo-tags are removed.

28. Thus, the process for visualization of road conditions based on specific area includes (a) collection and processing of road anomalies data for a particular area for a particular period of 10-15 days so that periodical variation in road anomalies can be noted and (b) geographical colour coding of the sub-areas within the area based on number and severity of anomalies. 

29. Para 0040 of the complete specifications also refers to the process of communication of the road anomalies to the subscriber drivers/users. The user is required to switch on the web mapping service application, select the destination to which he intends to travel and press Start.  When he does so, the system identifies his existing location, destination location and selects the best route1. 

30. From the database of road anomalies, the system downloads the road anomaly data for the road that the driver has selected and shows it to the driver on the web mapping service application.  The driver is thus warned of the upcoming road anomaly based on severity and the speed of the driver. The driver is also provided suggestion of the average speed at which the anomaly should be negotiated.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

Various embodiments of the present invention described herein generally relate to a road condition detection system for detecting and monitoring road conditions. 

Description of Related Art

Various road conditions may make a road difficult to navigate or increase the risk of damage to a vehicle driving on the road. Some of these conditions include road imperfections (e.g., potholes, bumps, and cracks), weather conditions (e.g., wet or icy roads), low visibility (e.g., due to street lights being out), or debris in the road (e.g., tree limbs, gravel, and car accident debris). If one of these conditions is present on a given road, it would be advantageous for drivers to be notified so they may avoid a particular road hazard or hazardous road condition. Additionally, it would be advantageous for appropriate agencies, such as the local Department of Transportation, to be notified so that hazardous conditions can be addressed and the public may be apprised of current road conditions. 

      Several media outlets exist that inform drivers of road conditions, such as local news stations, local radio stations, and online traffic sites. Similarly, government agencies (e.g., Department of Transportation) have systems that enable drivers to report roadway conditions to the appropriate personnel. However, the above-described media outlets and agencies often depend on people manually reporting road conditions. For example, if a driver sees a hazardous condition on a given road, the driver may call the Department of Transportation and describe the condition and its location (e.g., a pothole or patch of ice). In order to address the road condition, the Department of Transportation may first send a crew to locate the condition, which may be difficult to do depending on the description given by the driver. Furthermore, information regarding the road condition may become inaccurate through the chain of communication (e.g., where one DOT employee describes the condition inaccurately to another responsible for a repair or inspection). In addition, the crew may also need to inspect the identified road condition to determine what must be done to address it. At some later point in time, a separate crew may be sent to address the condition. This process is often imprecise and inefficient, thereby resulting in lingering hazardous road conditions posing a continuing threat to drivers and vehicles.
      Accordingly, there is an ongoing need in the art for systems and methods for more efficiently identifying and reporting road conditions.

      Overview

      The present invention relates to systems and methods for identifying and monitoring road conditions, and for communicating information regarding road conditions to various users.  According to various embodiments, a road condition detection system is provided for capturing data indicative of road conditions and analyzing the captured data to locate and identify various road conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as potholes, or weather conditions, such as ice). In various embodiments, the road condition detection system comprises a road condition sensor array configured for being attached to a vehicle and for capturing road condition data, an onboard computer for analyzing the road condition data in real time and transmitting information regarding road conditions to remotes users of the system, and a central data analysis server configured for conducting post processing analysis of the data collected by the road condition sensor array to determine additional information about various road conditions. 

      In various embodiments, the road condition sensor array is configured to sense and record information about a given road as the vehicle travels along the road. For example, the road condition sensor array may include an optical camera, a vibration sensor, a road surface scanner, and various other devices configured to capture road condition data indicative of various road condition attributes, such as a road's surface profile, imperfections, illumination level, reflectivity, and/or other conditions. The road condition sensor array may also include, or may be in communication with, a geo-location device, allowing the system to geo-code the location of road condition data indicative of these attributes. According to various embodiments, a plurality of vehicles in a fleet (e.g., a fleet of delivery vehicles) may each be equipped with a road condition sensor array, thereby capturing road condition data for various roads over a wide area at various times. 

      In various embodiments, the road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array may be processed and stored (in whole or in part) by an onboard vehicle computer. In addition, the data capturing operations of the road condition sensor array may be controlled by the onboard computer, which may dictate when the road condition sensor array captures road condition data and the frequency with which it does so. In addition, the onboard computer may include various telematics devices and sensors monitoring dynamic attributes of the vehicle, or may be in communication with a separate telematics devices or sensors provided on the vehicle.

      As described in greater detail below, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array may be analyzed by the onboard computer in order to identify various road conditions based on the road condition data (e.g., bumps, potholes, debris, wet or icy conditions, etc.). Information advising users of these various conditions may then be transmitted from the onboard computer to one or more users devices in real time over a network. In addition, the road condition data may be analyzed further by the central server to identify additional road conditions (e.g., more detailed information regarding cracks and potholes, visibility conditions, weather conditions, etc.). In addition, the central data analysis server may be configured to create data applied to maps indicating various road conditions (e.g., layers applied to digital maps), calculate a road condition index for individual roads or areas, and compare changes in road conditions for particular roads or locations. The analyses performed by the central server may be useful, for example, in identifying and communicating road conditions to drivers and for evaluation of road repairs and maintenance.

Road Condition Detection System

FIG. 1 shows a road condition detection system 100, according to one embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the road condition detection system 100 generally comprises a road condition sensor array 120 mounted on a vehicle 110, an onboard computer 130, and a central data analysis server (herein ""central server"") 170. As discussed in greater detail below, the onboard computer 130 is configured to communicate with the road condition sensor array 120 in order to control the capture and storage of road condition data. The onboard computer 130 is further configured to s communicate with the central server 170 via a communication network 150 in order to transmit road condition data to the server 170 for analysis. Additionally, the central server 170 and onboard computer 130 may be configured to communicate with one or more user devices 180 (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet computer, digital information acquisition device, or the like) to provide updated road condition data to a user. The components of the illustrated embodiment are discussed in more detail below.

Road Condition Sensor Array

      FIG. 2 shows a road condition sensor array 120 mounted on a vehicle 110 according to one embodiment. In the illustrated embodiment, the road condition sensor array 120 generally comprises a front sensing unit 121a housed within a detachable front mounting housing 122a, and a rear sensing unit 121b housed within a detachable rear mounting housing 122b. According to various embodiments, the front sensing unit 121a comprises various road image detection devices, including an optical camera, a vibration sensor, and a road surface scanner. As the vehicle 110 drives along a road 5, the road condition sensor array's sensing unit 121a captures road condition data relating to the conditions of the road 5. For example, the captured road condition data may include video data, surface profile data, illumination level data, vibration data, and other data generated by other devices in the sensing unit 121a. As described in greater detail below, the sensing unit's devices are in communication with the vehicle's onboard computer 130, which may be configured to control the operation of the sensing unit 121a and store captured road condition data. 

      In various embodiments, the sensing unit 121a includes an optical camera configured to capture video and/or still images of the road surface and detect the illumination level of the road 5. For example, in one embodiment, the optical camera may be configured to capture video of the road surface continuously as the vehicle 110 travels. In such embodiments, the onboard computer 130 may continuously store video data generated by the optical camera and may be configured to buffer and transmit data to a user device 180.

      According to various embodiments, the optical camera may also be configured to receive light from the road through an aperture in the camera housing, which may vary in size to control the amount of light reaching the optical sensor. The optical sensor is configured to detect the intensity of the light received through the aperture resulting in illumination level data corresponding to the illumination level of the road 5 at a given point. Accordingly, if the vehicle 110 is traveling at night along a lighted road and passes by an area where street lights are out, the illumination level data will indicate a reduction in luminous intensity. Similarly, the illumination level data may indicate poor illumination in tunnels, under bridges, or in covered areas (e.g., parking lots). In this way the optical camera is able to capture illumination level data indicative of a particular road's varying illumination levels along the distance traveled by the vehicle 110.
      
      In various embodiments, the optical camera may be further configured to detect the reflectivity of the surface of the road 5. This may be accomplished, for example, by the camera emitting light (e.g., via a flash bulb or LED bulb) and detecting the level of light reflected by the road surface. As such, the optical camera is able to capture reflectivity data indicative of the surface reflectivity of the road 5 at any given point. Accordingly, if a road surface is wet (e.g., due to rain or an oil leak) or coated with another hazardous substance, the reflectivity data will indicate a comparative increase in the reflectivity of the road surface. Likewise, where the road is dry, the reflectivity data will indicate a comparative decrease in the reflectivity of the road surface. In this way. the optical camera is also able to capture reflectivity data indicative of a particular roads varying reflectivity along the distance traveled by the vehicle 110. 
      
      As will be appreciated from the description herein, the optical camera may be configured to capture video data, illumination level data, and reflectivity data, or two or more cameras may be provided, each being configured to capture illumination level data or reflectivity data. In addition, a lens may be disposed within the camera housing aperture and a shutter and/or lens cover may cover the lens when the camera is not actively recording illumination level data or reflectivity data. In this way, the shutter and/or lens cover may protect the lens from damage such as being scratched or cracked. In other embodiments, the illumination level data and reflectivity data may be captured via other suitable devices. such as laser sensors or the like. 

      In addition to the optical camera, the sensing unit 121a may include a road surface scanner may comprise a laser or electromagnetic sensor disposed within a scanner housing. As the vehicle travels along the road 5, the sensor is configured to scan the surface of the road 5 and capture surface profile data indicative of the roads surface profile. Accordingly, if the vehicle 110 travels over a pothole, the captured surface profile data will indicate a depression in the road surface. Likewise. if the vehicle 110 travels over piece of debris or other object on the surface of the road 5, the captured surface profile data will indicate a protrusion on the road surface. In this way. the road surface scanner is able to capture surface profile data indicative of a particular roads full surface profile along the distance traveled by the vehicle 110.

      As noted above, the sensing unit 121a also includes a vibration sensor configured to capture vibration data indicative of the magnitude and frequency of vibration of the vehicle 110 as it travels along the road. For example, in one embodiment, the vibration sensor is configured to detect vibrations in the vehicles chassis (e.g., vibrations transmitted from the road surface through the wheels and suspension to the chassis). Accordingly, if the vehicle 110 travels over a pot hole, the vibration data captured by the vibration sensor will indicate a sharp change in vibration magnitude or frequency. Additionally, if the vehicle 110 is traveling a smooth road. the vibration data will indicate a low-magnitude, consistent vehicle vibration, while a rough road will result in inconsistent vibration data corresponding to various bumps and imperfections in the road surface. In this way, the vibration sensor is also able to capture vibration data indicative of the smoothness of a particular road along the distance traveled by the vehicle 110. 

      According to various embodiments, the sensing unit 121a may further comprise an infrared camera, a noise detecting device, and/or other road condition detecting devices. For example, the infrared camera may be used for capturing infrared data indicative of hot spots on the road surface while the noise detecting device may be used for capturing noise data indicative of loud noises associated with a vehicle traveling over a pot hole or other debris. Indeed, as will be appreciated from the description herein, the sensing unit 121a may include any road condition detecting device capable of detecting useful data indicative of one or more road conditions. Additionally, in some embodiments, the various cameras and/or sensors of the road condition sensor array 120 may have zoom capabilities in order to capture road condition data with at varying degrees of granularity.

      As shown in FIG. 2, the various devices of the sensing unit 121¢ are secured within a mounting housing 122a. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting housing 122a is mounted to the front bumper of vehicle 110 and faces the road surface directly in front of the vehicle 110 (e.g. as indicated by the dashed lines in FIG. 2). In certain embodiments, the mounting housing 122 includes a quick release mechanism configured to engage a mating member on the vehicles front bumper. This allows the sensing unit 121a to be easily removed from vehicle 110 and easily mounted on another vehicle. Moreover, as will be appreciated from the description herein, the vehicle 110 may include a plurality of mating members positioned at various locations on the vehicle 110 (e.g., front bumper, rear bumper, centrally underneath vehicle, side of vehicle frame, etc.) such that the one or more road condition sensor arrays 120 can be secured at various locations on the vehicle 110. 

      In the illustrated embodiment, the road condition sensing array 120 also includes a rear sensing unit 121b secured within a rear mounting housing 122b. According to various embodiments, the rear sensing unit 121b may comprise the same, or one or more of, the various sensors and detection devices provided in the front sensing unit 121a. In addition, the rear mounting housing 122b may be substantially the same as, or similar to, the front mounting housing 122a. As will be appreciated from FIG. 2, the provision of both front and rear sensing units 121a, 122b enables the road condition sensing array 120 to capture additional road condition data to verify various road conditions. Indeed, in certain embodiments, the rear sensing unit 121b may be configured to capture road condition data to confirm road conditions indicated by the road condition data captured by the front sensing unit 121a.

      In various other embodiments, the sensing units 121a, 121b and mounting housings 122a, 122b may be provided at any suitable location on the vehicle 110 depending on its configuration and intended use. In addition, according to various embodiments, less or additional sensing units may be provided as needed. For example, in certain embodiments. only a single front or rear sensing unit may be provided. In other embodiments, additional sensing units may be placed on lateral sides of the vehicle.

Onboard Computer & Communications Network

      According to various embodiments, the road condition sensor arrays sensing units 121a, 121b may be controlled by the vehicles onboard computer 130. In various embodiments, the onboard computer 130 comprises at least one processor, a location-determining device or sensor (e.g., a GPS sensor), a real-time clock, J-Bus protocol architecture, an electronic control module (ECM), a port for receiving data from vehicle sensors located on the vehicle 110, a communication port for receiving instruction data, a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, a power source, a data radio for communication with a WWAN, a WLAN and/or a WPAN, a programmable logic controller (PLC), and one or more memory storage devices. The memory storage devices may include volatile memory and/or non-volatile memory, which can be embedded and/or may be removable. For example, the non-volatile memory may be embedded or removable multimedia memory cards (MMCs), secure digital (SD) memory cards. Memory Sticks, EEPROM, flash memory, hard disk, or the like. The memory storage device may also include DRAM and NVRAM memory modules. In other embodiments, various components of the onboard computer 130 (e.g., the RFID tag, the location sensor, and the PLC) may be located in the vehicle 110, external from the onboard computer 130.

      The onboard computers location sensor may be, for example, a GPS-based sensor compatible with a low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite system, medium Earth orbit satellite system, or a Department of Defense (DOD) satellite system.  Alternatively, triangulation may be used in connection with various cellular towers positioned at various locations throughout a geographic area in order to determine the location of the vehicle 110. The location sensor may be used to receive position, time, and speed data. In addition, the location sensor may be configured to detect when its vehicle 110 has entered or exited a GPS-defined geographic area (e.g., a geo-fenced area). As will be appreciated from the description herein, more than one location sensor may be utilized, and other similar techniques may likewise be used to collect geo-location information associated with the vehicle 110.

In addition, various embodiments of the onboard computer 130 may include multiple processors configured for carrying out the various processes described herein. As will be appreciated from the description herein, the onboard computer 130 may not include certain of the components described above, and may include any other suitable components in addition to, or in place of, those described above. As an example, the onboard computer 130 may include various types of communications components (e.g., to support new or improved communications techniques).

 In the illustrated embodiment, the onboard computer 130 is generally configured to communicate with the road condition sensor arrays sensing units 121a, 121b in order to (i) control when the sensing units 121a, 122b capture road condition data, (ii) store the road condition data captured by the sensing units 121a, 122b, and (iii) transmit the stored road condition data to the central server 170 and/or the user device 180. For example, in one embodiment, the onboard computer 130 causes the sensing units 121a, 122b to capture road condition data continuously as the vehicle 110 travels. In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 causes the sensing units 121a, 122b to capture road condition data at given time intervals when the vehicle 110 is on (e.g., such that all of the sensing units sensors capture data every second, every 2 seconds, or every 5 seconds). In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 causes the sensing units 121a, 122b to capture road condition data at given distance intervals as the vehicle 110 travels down road 5 (e.g., such that all of the sensing units sensors capture data every 5 feet, every 10 feet, or every 50 feet traveled).

      In further embodiments, the onboard computer 130 causes the sensing units 121a, 122b to start or stop capturing road condition data when the vehicle 110 changes direction, goes over a bump, or accelerates. In addition, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to monitor signals received from the sensing units 121a, 122b and capture data only when certain predefined parameters are met (e.g., illumination intensity below a predefined valued or a road surface profile deviating more than a certain amount from a predefined base profile). Moreover, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to trigger data capture by one or more specific devices in the sensing units 121a, 122b according to the criteria above. Indeed. as will be appreciated from the description herein, the onboard computer 130 may be programmed to trigger data capture by the sensing units 121a, 122b according to any desirable parameters. 
      As noted above, the onboard computer 130 includes a location-determining device or sensor, such as a GPS sensor, and a real-time clock. Accordingly, in various embodiments, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to associate and store location and/or date and time informatione.g., as indicated by the location sensor and clockwith the road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array 120. By associating location and date and time information with the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array 120, the physical and temporal location of a road hazard indicated by the road condition data may be determined (e.g., by the central server 170 as explained below).
      In various embodiments, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array 120 may be stored in the onboard computer 130 (e.g. in the computers memory storage devices). For example, in certain embodiments, the onboard computer 130 is configured to store road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array 120 continuously as it is captured. In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 is configured to store road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array 120 only if the onboard computer 130 detects a deviation in the road condition data that may indicate the presence of a road hazard (e.g., a change in vibration frequency or road surface profile). In yet another embodiment, the onboard computer 130 is configured to store only road condition data captured within a particular geo-fenced area.

      As described in greater detail below, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array 120 and stored by the onboard computer 130 is transmitted to the central server 170 via a communications network 150. According to various embodiments of the present invention, the communications network 150 may be capable of supporting communication in accordance with any one or more of a number of second-generation (2G), 2.5G and/or third-generation (3G) mobile communication protocols or the like. More particularly, the network 150 may be capable of supporting communication in accordance with 2G wireless communication protocols IS-136 (TDMA), GSM, and IS-95 (CDMA). Also, for example, the network 150 may be capable of supporting communication in accordance with 2.5G wireless communication protocols GPRS, Enhanced Data GSM Environment (EDGE), or the like. In addition, for example, the network 150 can be capable of supporting communication in accordance with 3G wireless communication protocols such as Universal Mobile Telephone System (UMTS) network employing Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) radio access technology. Some narrow-band AMPS (NAMPS), as well as TACS, network(s) may also benefit from embodiments of the present invention, as should dual or higher mode mobile stations (e.g., digital/ analog or TDMA/CDMA/analog phones). As yet another example, the network 150 may support communication in accordance with techniques such as, for example, radio frequency (RF), Bluetooth, infrared (IrDA), or any of a number of different wireless networking techniques, including Wireless LAN (WLAN) techniques. 

      In certain embodiments, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to transmit stored road condition data whenever it is able to establish a successful connection with the central server 170 via a WLAN component of the network 150 (e.g., when the vehicle 110 returns to a hub broadcasting a wireless networking signal). In addition, the onboard computer 130 may be further configured to immediately transmit (e.g. via 3G cellular network) captured road condition data meeting predefined alert parameters (e.g., road condition data clearly indicating a road hazard, such as a pothole or debris). In such embodiments, the onboard computer 130 (and/or central server 170) may be further configured to transmit the alert-status road condition data to the Department of Transportation, local media outlets, or other online road condition services in order to provide real-time status updates for various roads. 
      
Central Server
       According to various embodiments, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array 120 and stored by the onboard computer 130 may be subsequently transmitted over the network 150 to the central server 170 for post processing. As will be appreciated from the description herein, the central server 170 includes various devices for performing one or more functions in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, including those more particularly shown and described herein. However, various embodiments of the central server 170 may include alternative devices for performing one or more like functions without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. 
      In various embodiments, the central server 170 includes a processor that communicates with other elements within the central server 170 via a system interface or bus. In some embodiments, the central server 170 includes a display device/input device for receiving and displaying data. This display device/input device may be, for example, a keyboard or pointing device that is used in combination with a monitor. In certain embodiments, the central server 170 may not include a display device/input device and may be alternatively accessed by a separate computing device (e.g., a networked workstation) having a display device and input device. The central server 170 further includes memory, which preferably includes both read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). The server's ROM is used to store a basic input/output system (BIOS), containing the basic routines that help to transfer information between elements within the central server 170. 
      In addition, the central server 170 includes at least one storage devicesuch as a hard disk drive, a floppy disk drive, a CD Rom drive, or optical disk drivefor storing information on various computer-readable media, such as a hard disk, a removable magnetic disk, or a CD-ROM disk. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, each of these storage devices is connected to the system bus by an appropriate interface. The storage devices and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage for a personal computer. It is important to note that the computer-readable media described above could be replaced by any other type of computer-readable media known in the art. 
      A number of program modules may be stored by the various storage devices and within RAM. Such program modules include an operating system and/or a plurality of program modules (e.g., one or more modules configured for analyzing road condition data). According to various embodiments, the modules control certain aspects of the operation of the central server 170 with the assistance of the processor and operating system. 
      Also located within the central server 170 is a network interface for interfacing and communicating with other elements of a computer network. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that one or more of the central server 170 components may be located geographically remotely from other central server 170 components. Furthermore, one or more of the components may be combined, and additional components performing functions described herein may be included in the central server 170.  
      While the foregoing describes a single processor, as one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the central server 170 may comprise multiple processors operating in conjunction with one another to perform the functionality described herein. In addition to the memory, the processor can also be connected to at least one interface or other means for displaying, transmitting and/or receiving data, content or the like. In this regard, the interface(s) can include at least one communication interface or other means for transmitting and/or receiving data, content or the like, as well as at least one user interface that can include a display and/or a user input interface. The user input interface, in turn, can comprise any of a number of devices allowing the entity to receive data from a user, such as a keypad, a touch display, a mouse, a joystick or other input device.
       While reference is made to a central server 170, as one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to a client-server architecture. The system of embodiments of the present invention is further not limited to a single server, or similar network entity or mainframe computer system. Other similar architectures including one or more network entities operating in conjunction with one another to provide the functionality described herein may likewise be used without departing from the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention. For example, a mesh network of two or more personal computers (PCs), or similar electronic devices, collaborating with one another to provide the functionality described herein in association with the central server 170 may likewise be used without departing from the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.
      In the illustrated embodiment, the central server 170 is configured to receive road condition data from the onboard computer 130 via network 150. For example, in certain s embodiments, the central server 170 may receive a substantially real-time data feed via network 150. In other embodiments, the central server 170 may receive road condition data downloaded from the onboard computer 130 when the vehicle 110 is in range of a WLAN. 
      
      Processing of Road Condition Data 
      FIG. 3 illustrates steps executed by the road condition detection system 100 to analyze captured road condition data according to one embodiment. As shown in FIG. 3, the process begins at step 302 where road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array 120 is transmitted to the onboard computer 130 via a road sensor input interface. Next, at step 204, the onboard computer 130 performs continuous storage and buffering of the road condition data received from the sensor array 120.
       Simultaneously, in step 306, the onboard computer 130 analyzes the vibration data present in the road condition data. At step 308, the onboard computer determines whether a bump has been indicated by the vibration data. For example, where the vehicle travels over a pothole or piece of debris, the vibration data captured by the sensor arrays vibration sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) will indicate a sharp change in vibration. If a bump is detected, the onboard computer moves to step 310 where it marks the road condition data corresponding to the detected bump and freezes the data buffer (e.g., saving and marking the previous one minute of data). 
      Next, at step 312, the onboard computer 130 determines whether real time transmission of road condition information is enabled. If real time transmission is enabled, the onboard computer 130 moves to step 314 where it immediately transmits road condition data captured around the impact of the detected bump. For example, in one embodiment, the onboard computer 130 may immediately transfer the relevant road condition data to the central server 170 for processing and transmission to various user devices 180. In other embodiments, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to be configured to immediately transmit the relevant road condition data directly to a user device 180. In yet another embodiment, the onboard computer 130 may be configured to immediately generate and transmit road condition information indicative of the detected bump and/or any related road conditions to the user device 180. In this way, hazardous conditions may be transmitted in real-time wirelessly to users for immediate updates regarding road conditions.  
      Turning now to step 316, the onboard computer 130 is further configured to perform an end-of-day upload of all captured road condition data. For example, as noted above, in one embodiment the onboard computer 130 may be configured to transmit all captured road condition data to the central server 170 at the end of work day when a WLAN 2 connection can be established with the central server. Next, at step 318, post processing of the captured road condition data is performed by the central server 170. In certain embodiments, this may include reformatting the data and associating the captured road condition data with GPS coordinates and time stamp data to provide context to the captured road condition data.  
      Next, at step 320, the central server next performs signature recognition analyses of the road condition data to determine further information regarding road conditions. These analyses are described in greater detail below in regard to the exemplary method shown in FIG. 4. Finally, at step 322, the central server 170 generates finalized reports and contents for distribution to various user devices 180.  The reports and content may include, but are not limited to, map data for display on existing digital maps indicating one or more road conditions (e.g., on Google Maps), reports on the conditions of roads in certain areas, text messages alerting users to various road hazards, and the like. In certain embodiments, a report may be generated where a user may use a viewer to fast forward through video data to locations where hazardous road conditions have been identified.  
      Referring back to step 320 in greater detail, various embodiments of the central server 170 are generally configured for analyzing road condition data received from the onboard computer 130 to identify hazardous road conditions indicated by signatures in the data. In various embodiments, the central server 170 includes a pattern recognition module for processing the road condition data. As described in greater detail below, the pattern recognition module is  generally configured for sensing deviations in the road  condition data which may indicate various specific road  conditions or road hazards.  
      FIG. 4 illustrates steps executed by the pattern recognition module according to one embodiment. Beginning at step 190, the pattern recognition module identifies and retrieves target road condition data. For example, in certain embodiments, a user may request that the central server 170 analyze data for a particular area (e.g.. a geo-fenced area such as a county, city, highway, neighborhood, or the like) received during a particular time period (e.g., within the past week).  In this case, the pattern recognition module would review the road condition data it has received from the onboard computer 130 and identify road condition data captured at locations within the user-specified area during the user-specified time period. As will be appreciated from the description herein, the pattern recognition module may be configured to retrieve target data relating to any set of user parameters.
 	
      Next, at step 200, the pattern recognition module analyzes. the video data (e.g., the video or image data captured by the sensing units optical camera) present in the retrieved road condition data to identify potential road imperfections. For example, as the vehicle 110 travels along the road 5 in FIG. 2, the video data will show relatively consistent images of the road surface. However, where potholes, cracks, debris, or other imperfections are present, the pattern recognition module will identify these deviations in the image signature and associate them with road imperfections. If the pattern recognition module detect imperfections in the roads surface based on the video data, the module moves to step 201 where the associated data is stored (e.g., in the servers memory storage areas). In addition, at step 201, the pattern recognition module will determine the location and time of the captured data associated with the road imperfection and associate this location/time data with the stored video data for use in generating images of road imperfections.
      Next, at step 202, the pattern recognition module analyzes the surface profile data (e.g., data captured by the sensing units road surface scanner) present in the retrieved target road condition data to identify potential road imperfections. For example, as the vehicle 110 travels along the road 5 in FIG. 2, the surface profile data will indicate a relatively consistent road profile (e.g., a consistent detected distance from the scanner to the road surface). However, where the vehicle 110 travels over a pothole or piece of debris in the road, the surface profile data will deviate significantly and indicate an abnormal surface profile. Accordingly, the pattern recognition module is configured to identify deviations or abnormalities in the surface profile data. In addition, the pattern recognition module may be configured to compare the surface profile data in the target data with historical surface profile data to identify changes in the road surface profile over a period of time (e.g., by comparing earlier surface profile measurements captured at a particular location with the most recent surface profile measurement for the particular location to identify surface profile deviations or abnormalities).

      As shown in FIG. 4, if the pattern recognition module does not detect imperfections in the roads surface profile based on the surface profile data, the module moves to step 204. However, if the pattern recognition module does detect imperfections in the roads surface profile, the module moves to step 203 where the associated data is stored (e.g., in the servers memory storage areas). In addition, at step 203, the pattern recognition module will determine the location and time of the captured data associated with the road imperfection and associate this location/time data with the stored surface profile data for use in generating graphical representations of road imperfections.

      Next, at step 204, the pattern recognition module analyzes the vibration data (e.g., data captured by the sensing units vibration sensor) present in the retrieved target road condition data to identify potential road imperfections. For example, as a vehicle 110 travels along the road 5 in FIG. 2, the vibration data will indicate relatively consistent road profile (e.g., a consistent vibration frequency detected as the vehicle 110 moves). However. where the vehicle 110 travels over a pothole or piece of debris in the road, the vibration data will deviate significantly and indicate an abnormal surface profile (e.g., a sharp change in vibration frequency or magnitude). Accordingly, the pattern recognition module is configured to identify deviations or abnormalities in the vibration data.

      As shown in FIG. 4, if the pattern recognition module does not detect imperfections in the road's surface profile based on the vibration data, the module moves to step 206. However, if the  pattern recognition module does detect imperfections in the road's surface profile, the module moves to step 205 where the associated data is stored (e.g., in the server's memory storage areas), In addition, at step 205, the pattern recognition module will again determine the location and time of the captured data associated with the road imperfection and associate this location/time data with the stored vibration data for use in generating graphical representations of road imperfections.

      Next, at step 206, the pattern recognition module analyzes the illumination level data (e.g., data captured by the sensing unit's optical camera) present in the retrieved target road condition data to identify potential low illumination sections of road. For example, as a vehicle 110 travels along the road 5 in FIG. 2, the illumination level data will indicate relatively consistent illumination (e.g., either a consistent day- light luminous intensity or, during the night, a consistent artificial light luminous intensity). However, where the vehicle 110 travels on a portion of road where a street light is out - or that is otherwise poorly lit - the illumination level data will deviate significantly and indicate an abnormal illumination level (e.g., a sharp change in illumination intensity). Accordingly, the pattern recognition module is configured to identify deviations or abnormalities in the illumination level data. In addition, the pattern recognition module may be configured to compare the illumination level data in the target data with historical illumination level data to identify changes in illumination levels over a period of time (e.g., by comparing earlier illumination level measurements captured at a particular location at a particular time of day with the most recent illumination level measurement for the particular location at the particular time of day to identify illumination level deviations or abnormalities).
      
      As shown in FIG. 4, if the pattern recognition module does not detect low illumination levels based on the illumination level data, the module moves to step 208. However, if the pattern recognition module does detect low illumination levels, the module moves to step 207 where the associated data is stored (e.g., in the server's memory storage areas). In addition, at step 207, the pattern recognition module will again determine the location and time of the captured data associated with the low illumination levels an associate this location/time data with the stored illumination level data for use in generating graphical representations road imperfections. 
      
      Next, at step 208, the pattern recognition module generates a graphical representation of various road condition indicated by the target road condition data. For example, in one embodiment, the graphical representation may comprise an interactive road map showing the location of potential road imperfections (e.g., potholes or debris) and low illumination areas (e.g., where a street or tunnel light is out). In this way, a user is able to view road conditions existing within the parameters set for the target data (e.g., hazards within a particular area and/or time period). In addition, the interactive road map may be configured to automatically match before and after images and/or data regarding particular condition so the user is provided with comparative information about the current and prior state of the condition. For example, in one embodiment, a user may select a particular road hazard on the map and the pattern recognition module will retrieve the most recent image of the hazard (e.g., an image of a pothole captured by the optical camera) and next most recent image of the hazard (e.g., an earlier image of the same location before pot hole was formed).
      
      As will be appreciated from the description herein, various embodiments of the pattern recognition module may be configured to analyze additional road condition data to identify other road conditions. For example, as noted above, the sensing unit 121 may be configured to capture reflectivity data indicative of the reflection coefficient of a road surface. As such, the pattern recognition module may be configured to analyze any captured reflectivity data and identify data indicating an abnormal reflectivity (e.g., where the road is wet or icy). Additionally, the pattern recognition module may be configured to similarly analyze infrared data (e.g. to identify iced roads) and noise data (e.g., to identify debris or road imperfections). Furthermore, the pattern recognition module may be configured to show conditions indicated by this additional data on any generated graphical representations, such as the interactive map noted above. The pattern recognition system may also be configured to identify additional conditions indicated by the road condition data. For example, in certain embodiments, the illumination level data and reflectivity data may be used to indicate weather conditions in a particular area (e.g., sunny, cloudy, raining, etc.). In addition, the condition of painted lines on roads (e.g., lane markers) may be evaluated based on captured video data, reflectivity data, or the like (e.g., to determine whether painted lines are weathered and need to be repainted). 
      
      In various embodiments, the pattern recognition module may also be configured to use the hazards or conditions to calculate a road condition index representing a relative hazard level for a particular road or area. For example, in certain embodiments, the road condition index may be calculated using a predetermined function of the number of identified hazards occurring over a given length of road and/or the illumination level over a given length of road. In further embodiments, the predetermined function for calculating the road condition index may take into account the severity of the identified hazards. For example, in various embodiments, a deep pot hole indicated by surface profile data may be weighted more heavily in the road condition index calculation than a light bump indicated by the vibration data. In certain embodiments, the sensor array may also be configured to direct certain optical cameras towards road signs or mile markers and captures images indicating where other associated road condition data is being captured.  
      
      Use of Road Condition Sensor Arrays in Vehicle Fleet

      According to various embodiments, the road condition detection system 100 may be adapted for use with a fleet of vehicles in order to provide comprehensive road condition updates. The vehicle fleet may be, for example, that of a freight or mail carrier (e.g., the United States Postal Service or United Parcel Service, Inc.), a public transportation provider (e.g., city buses and/or taxis), or one or more rental car agencies. In such embodiments, road condition sensor arrays 120 are provided on numerous vehicles in the fleet and configured to transmit captured road condition data to the central server 170. In this way, road condition data indicative of all roads on which the equipped vehicles travel can be collected and analyzed by the central server 170 (e.g., using the methods described above). By providing roads condition sensor arrays on one or more large vehicle fleets, road condition data may be captured and analyzed to indicate road conditions over a wide area.
      
      In embodiments where the central server 170 receives large amounts of road condition data from road condition sensor arrays 120 in a vehicle fleet, the servers pattern recognition module may be configured to repeat steps 202-208 for all received road condition data in order to continuously identify potential road hazards. In various embodiments, information about identified road conditions may be communicated to the Department of Transportation, local media outlets, online road condition services, directly to user devices 180, and/or stored by server 170. In addition, the pattern recognition module may be further configured to continuously update the above-described interactive map (e.g., by periodic updates in accordance with the transmission of road condition data from the onboard computers 130 to the server 170 and by immediate alert updates in the scenarios noted above). This updated, global interactive road map may also include calculated road condition indexes. 
      In various embodiments, the global interactive map may be made accessible via a website or other remote application such that it can be accessed via the network 150 and viewed one a remote personal computer, smart phone, or other device. In this way, the interactive map can be accessed and viewed by drivers, government agencies, and others interested in updates on the status of potential road hazards. In further embodiments, the central server 170 may be configured for indicating potential road hazards on other map-based systems, such as Google Maps, Bing Maps, or Apple Maps. As noted above, the road condition information provided in this way may be used to plan road repairs, salting, other road maintenance, as well as to provide status updates for commuters in order to avoid traffic and potential vehicle damage.
      
      CONCLUSION

      As will be appreciated from the description herein, the components and operation of the road condition detection system 100 may be modified according to various embodiments. For example, various sensing devices may be employed in the road condition sensor arrays sensing unit 121 to capture a variety of road condition data. In addition, the central server 170 may be configured accordingly to identify various hazards and other conditions based on the captured road condition data using various methods or algorithms.

32. Mr. Rana, learned Counsel for the appellant, points out the following features of distinction, between the invention in the suit patent and D-2:
S.No.

33. While the subject matter of D-2 is also a system mounted on the vehicle to track road anomalies, Mr. Rana submits that the above features are unique to the subject patent and cannot be said to be either anticipated or obvious from D-2.  A person skilled in the art would not, he submits, be able to arrive at the invention in the subject patent from the teachings in the suit patent without hindsight knowledge.  Mr. Rana submits that, in assessing whether the later patent would be obvious or anticipated from the earlier patent, the Court is required, as per the judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffmann La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd2, to
(i) identify a person ordinarily skilled in the art,
(ii) identify the inventive concept embodied in the patent,
(iii) impute, to the normally skilled but unimaginative ordinary person skilled in the art what was common general knowledge in the art at the priority date,
(iv)  identify the differences between the matter cited and the alleged invention and ascertain whether the differences are merely workshop improvements or actually involve inventive steps,
(v) determine whether the differences would be obvious to a person skilled in the art without having to adopt a hindsight approach.  
Viewed thus, Mr. Rana submits that it cannot be said that the subject patent has no inventive step vis-à-vis D-2.  

Analysis

34. When one reads the complete specifications in D-2 vis-à-vis the principal features of the subject patent which are claimed to be inventive, the conclusion is inevitable that all the said features are already expressly envisioned in the complete specifications in D-2.  For ready reference, and at the cost of repetition, the following extracts from the complete specifications in D-2 may be noted:

(i) According to various embodiments, a road condition detection system is provided for capturing data indicative of road conditions and analysing the captured data to locate and identify various road conditions (e.g., road hazards, such as potholes, or weather conditions, such as ice).  In various embodiments, the road condition detection system comprises a road condition sensor array configured for being attached to a vehicle and for capturing road condition data, an onboard computer for analysing the road condition data in real time and transmitting information regarding road conditions to remote users of the system, and a central data analysis server configured for conducting post processing analysis of the data collected by the road condition sensor array to determine additional information about various road conditions.

(ii) In various embodiments, the road sensor array is configured to sense and record information about a given road as the vehicle travels along the road.  For example, the road condition sensor array may include an optical camera, a vibration sensor, a road surface scanner, and various other devices configured to capture road condition data indicative of various road condition attributes

(iii) The road condition sensor array may also include, or may be in communication with, a geo-location device, allowing the system to geo-code the location of road condition data indicative of these attributes.

(iv) As described in greater detail below, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array may be analysed by the onboard computer in order to identify various road conditions based on the road condition data In addition, the road condition data may be analysed further by the Central server to identify additional road conditions.   In addition, the central data analysis server may be configured to create data applied to maps indicating various road conditions (e.g. layers applied to digital maps), calculate a road condition index for individual roads or areas, and compare changes in road conditions for particular roads or locations.  The analysis performed by the Central server may be useful, for example, in identifying and communicating road conditions to drivers and for evaluation of road repairs and maintenance.

(v) Fig. 1 shows a road condition detection system, according to one embodiment.  In the illustrated embodiment, the road condition detection system generally comprises a road condition sensor array mounted on the vehicle, an on-board computer, and the central data analysis server (herein central server).  As discussed in greater detail below, the on-board computer is configured to communicate with the road condition sensor array in order to control the capture and storage of road condition data.  The on board computer is further configured to communicate with the central server via a communication network in order to transmit road condition data to the server for analysis.  Additionally, the central server and on-board computer may be configured to communicate with one or more user devices (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet computer, digital information acquisition device, or the like) to provide updated road condition data to the user.

(vi) Fig. 2 shows a road condition sensor array mounted on the vehicle according to one embodiment.   According to various embodiments, the front sensing unit comprises various road to make detection devices, including an optical camera, a vibration sensor and a road surface scanner.  As the vehicle drives along a road, the road condition sensor arrays sensing unit captures road condition data relating to the conditions of the road.  For example, the captured road condition data may0020include video data, surface profile data, illumination level data, vibration data, and other data generated by other devices in the sensing unit.

(vii)  For example, in one embodiment, the optical camera may be configured to capture video of the road surface continuously as the vehicle travels.  In such embodiments, the on-board computer may continuously store video data generated by the optical camera and may be configured to buffer and transmit data to a user device.  

(viii) In various other embodiments, the sensing units and mounting housings may be provided at any suitable location on the vehicle depending on its configuration and intended use.

(ix) In the illustrated embodiment, the on-board computer is generally configured to communicate with the road condition sensor arrays sensing units in order to (i) control when the sensing units capture road condition data, (ii) store the road condition data captured by the sensing units, and (iii) transmit the stored road condition data to the central server and/or the user device.  For example, in one embodiment, the on-board computer courses the sensing units to capture road condition data continuously as the vehicle travels.

(x) In various embodiments, the road condition data captured by the road condition sensor array may be stored in the on-board computer (e.g., in the computers memory storage devices).  For example, in certain embodiments, the on-board computer is configured to store road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array continuously as it is captured.  In other embodiments, the on-board computer is configured to store road condition data collected by the road condition sensor array only if the on-board computer detects a deviation in the road condition data that may indicate the presence of a road hazard

35. So comprehensive, indeed, are the complete specifications of the D-2 patent that reference to further extracts therefrom is hardly necessary.  A reading of the complete specifications indicates that the D-2 patent has envisioned a system for detecting road anomalies which is largely similar to that envisioned by the subject patent.  The principle of a camera capturing road anomalies, which may be an audio or video camera, and which may capture anomalies in the road as the vehicle travels; the principle of the system being mounted on one vehicle, vis-à-vis a multitude of vehicles; the transmission of the data captured by the camera/sensor array to the on-board computer; the diverse possibilities of the data being stored on real-time basis, vis-à-vis the data being stored on a backup platform so as to have access to historical data regarding the road; geo-profiling of the road, road conditions, and the network of roads; transmission of the data to a central server which would, either on real-time basis or on the basis of historical data, chart the anomalies in various roads; and final transmission of the data to the users so as to provide information regarding road anomalies and take remedial steps where necessary, are all fully and completely contemplated, captured and visualised by the D-2 patent.  The possibility of various embodiments, in which the specifics of the various features of the system for tracking road anomalies may vary, and the specific varied features are all envisaged by the D-2 patent.  

36. The aspect of obviousness, vis-à-vis prior art, has, unlike the trade mark regime, to be assessed from the point of view of a person skilled in the art who is possessed of common general knowledge as it exists on the priority date of the prior art, but who is not expected to exercise any imaginative faculties.  The authority, or the Court, assessing the aspect of validity of the later patent in view of the teachings contained in the earlier patent, has to reasonably assess whether a person skilled in the art would, or would not, be able to arrive at the later patent from the teachings in the complete specifications of the earlier patent. Absolute identity of the specifications in the two patents is not what is required.  What is needed is sufficiency of guidance or teaching in the specifications of the earlier patent which, when coupled with the object sought to be achieved by the later patent, would arm a person skilled in the art, possessed of ordinary general knowledge as it existed on the priority date of the earlier patent, to arrive at the later patent.  While trademark infringement is examined from the point of view of a person of average intelligence and imperfect recollection, the person, from whose point of view the aspect of patent infringement is to be examined, or from whose point of view the aspect of obviousness of the later patent from the earlier patent is to be assessed, is a person who is neither of average intelligence nor suffers from any imperfection in recollection.  He is a person who is skilled in the art and is, therefore, vis-à-vis the art concerned, possessed of the necessary intelligence and skill as is expected of a person dealing in such matters.

37. The impugned order of the Assistant Controller has extracted certain observations from Order 250/2012 dated 2 November 2012 passed by the IPAB, which read:
Once the very subject-matter of the invention has been disclosed by the prior art the person skilled in the art is assumed to be willing to make trial and error experiments to get it to work (The person) is not a person of exceptional skill and; knowledge He must, however, be prepared to display a reasonable degree of skill and common knowledge of the art in making trials

On the aspect of obviousness, the following observations of the IPAB had been relied upon by the Assistant Controller:
	When there is a design need or market pressure to solve a the problem and (there they) are a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill in the art has as good reason to pursue the known options within his or her technical grasp.  If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense


To my mind, these observations correctly encapsulate the principle of obviousness, and the indicia of an inventive step, vis-à-vis prior art, as a requirement of a valid patent.

38. Given the weight and amplitude of the teachings in the complete specifications of the D-2 patent, I find no reason to differ with the decision of the Assistant Controller, insofar as it holds that the subject patent is invalid on the ground of obviousness and lack of inventive step, when compared with the prior art D-2.  

Conclusion

39. For all the aforesaid reasons, the appeal fails and is dismissed.

HON’BLE MR. JUSTICE PRATEEK JALAN  
PRATEEK JALAN, J.  (ORAL)  
  
1. By way of this petition under Section 34 of the Ar bitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 [“the Act”], the petitioner assails a n order of the 
learned Sole Arbitrator , dated 19.02.2024 , by which the counter claims 
filed by the petitioner  have been dismissed on the ground of limitation.  
2. The disputes between the parties arose out of an agreement dated 
10.05.2014  [“the Agreement”] , by which the petitioner undertook to 
construct a tower in a project being buil t by the respondent. The 
Agreement was for a period of three years , expiring on 10.05.2017.  
3. The petitione r filed its counter claim s on 19.10.2022 , raising 
claims on account of refund of retention money , rental for  its machinery 
deployed in the project and interest.  
4. The counter claim s were  originally not considered by the learned 
Arbitrator on the ground that they have been filed belatedly. By an order  
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 2 of 8 
 dated 08.01.2024 passed in O.M.P.(COMM) 13/2024 , filed by the 
petitioner herein, this Court record ed an agreement  between the parti es 
that the counter claim s will be  taken on record by the learned Arbitral 
Tribunal, subject to payment of costs by the petitioner. It was inter alia 
directed that the learned Arbitral Tribunal may , at the request of either 
side, consider the question of limitation with regard to the counter claim s 
as a preliminary issue, if it was , in the opinion of the learned Arbitrator , 
possible to decide the same without evidence.  The impugned order  dated 
19.02.2024 has been made in this context .  
5. The Arbitral T ribunal  has found the counter claims to be beyond 
the period of limitation , on the reas oning that the cause of action for filing 
of the counter claim s had, according to the petitioner , arisen on 
08.01.2017 and the counter claim s had been filed only on 19.10.2022.  
6. I have heard Mr. Gursat Singh Vachher, learned counsel for the 
petitioner , and Mr. Pankaj Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the 
respondent, who appears on advance notice.  
7. Mr. Vachher ’s principal  submission is that the claim of the 
petitioner was on accoun t of refund of retention money , which was to be 
refunded by the respondent to the petitioner  only after the expiry of the 
defect liability  period. According to him , the defect  liability  period of one 
year under the Agreement , ended  on 31.03.201 9, giving rise to the cause 
of action on 01.04.2019, and the  counter claim was therefore to be filed 
by 01.04.2022 . However , he cites the order of the Supreme Court dated 
10.01.2022 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) 3/2020 [ In Re: Cognizance 
for Extension of Limitation ], by which the Supreme Court had granted an 
extension of limitation for the pe riod of the COVID -19 pandemic.   
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 3 of 8 
 8. Mr. Singh opposes this submission , on the ground that it is entirely 
beyond the pleadings in the counter claim filed by the petitioner. He 
submits that the counter claim itself stated that the amounts were payable  
in January 2017 , and that the learned Arbitrator has correctly found that 
the counter claims were therefore barred by limitation. Mr. Singh has also 
drawn  my attention to an order of the N ational Company Law Tribunal  
[“NCLT”] dated 18.05.202 3, in proceedings institu ted by the petitioner 
against the respondent [ IB-494(ND)/2020 ] under Section 9 of the 
Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 . He submits that the counter 
claims  raised  by the petitioner before the learned Arbitral T ribunal were 
identical to those asserted in the petition filed before the NCLT , which 
was dismissed on the ground that the claims were barred by time. In these 
circumstances, Mr. Singh urges  that the findings of the learn ed Arbitrator 
in the impugned order , cannot be considered as arbitrary or irr ational , so 
as to warrant interference under Section 34 of the Act.  
9. In rejecting the petitioner’s counter claims on this ground , the 
learned Arbitrator has noticed paragraph 5 of the counter claim filed by 
the petitioner , and the aforesaid order of the NCLT.  It may be noted that 
the petitioner has not placed on record either the counter claim or the 
order of the NCLT , although both are expressly  referred to in the 
reasoning of the  learned Arbitrator. I am unable to find any justification 
for withholding th ese basic document s, including the counter claim itself . 
In commercial case s, such as this one , the statement of truth contains an 
averment that all documents in the power , possession,  control or custody 
of the deponent  pertaining to the facts and circumstances  of the 
proceedings have been  disclose d and that the deponent is aware of the  
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 4 of 8 
 liability for action to be taken in law in the situation of any f alse 
statement or concealment. The petitioner does not appear to have 
followed this requirement in the prese nt case. However, c opies of the said 
documents have been handed over in Court by Mr. Singh , and the 
conten ts there of are not disputed.  
10. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the counter claim s are reproduced below:  - 
“5) That till 07.01.2017, the Respondent had made certain ad -hoc 
payments, in response to the cons tant communications which were 
underway between the Parties. However, after 07.01.2017, till date, 
no run ning account bill payments what soever had been credited in 
favour of the Claimant, thereby resulting in an o utstanding 
operational debt of Rs.40,55,769/ - in favour of the Claimant. 
Moreover, a  , one of the diesel generators (62 KVA) of the Claimant 
was also misappropriated by the Respondent, the total amount of 
which comes to tune of Rs.44,05,000/ - (equipment rental of 
Rs.39,45,000 + Diesel generator of Rs. 4,60,000). That as a matter of 
practice, any delay in clearance of invoices attracts interest at 18 % 
per annum . Consequently, as of Ledger Closing for 2020, a total 
outstanding amount of Rs. 80,97,501/ - was du e and payable by the 
Respondent in favour of the Claimant.  
 
6)  That until the last invoice raised by the Claimant i.e. RA Bill 
no.21 dated 20.05.2017 the Respondent had to also pay the rent for 
machinery and other construction material at the project site  which 
was installed by the Claimant in adherence of the Agreement. This 
rent has accrued owing to the fact that after foreclosure of the 
Agreement  from a period of January, 2017  to September, 2019, the 
machinery and other equipment's were being used by t he Respondent 
even after repeated requests of the Claimant to return the same. 
Ancillary to the same, one of the diesel generators (62 KVA) of the 
Claimant was also misappropriated by the Respondent, the total 
amount of which comes to tune of Rs. 44,05,000  (equipment rental 
of Rs. 39,45,000 + Diesel generator of Rs. 4,60,000). Hence, the total 
amount of claim that that is left unpaid by the Respondent  is 
Rs.1,63,87,567.23/ - (Inclus ive of Interest of Rs. 82,90,066.23/ -). The 
copy of interest calculation shee t is annexed as ANNEXURE -6.”1 
 
11. On the basis of these averments, the petitioner has asserted a claim 
 
1 Emphasis supplied.   
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 5 of 8 
 of ₹80,97,501/ - on account of principal and a claim of ₹82,90,066.23 /- on 
account of interest , amounting to a total  claim  of ₹1,63,87,567.23/ -. It is 
clear from paragraph 5 above , that the petitioner ’s contention was that the 
payments were due to it from 07.01.2017.  
12. The computation of interest contained in Annexure 6 to the counter 
claim is reproduced below : 
 
The table on the right , titled “Interest Period Calculation” , also shows that 
interest on the entire  amount  has been computed by the petitioner from  
01.02.2017 . The  necessary  corollary  is that the petitioner’s own assertion  
was that the amount was due on or before 01.02.2017.  
13. Once that is so, the finding of the learned  Arbitrator that the 
counter claims were barred by limitation when file d, cannot be faulted. 
The arguments to the contrary , with reference to the defect  liability 
period , are entirely beyond the scope of the pleadings . Mr. Vac hher s tates 
that these submissions were made orally and in writing before the learned 
Arbitrator , but I am of the view that the learned Arbitrator ’s reliance  upon 
the petitioner’s own pleadings to meet  the case argued , can certainly not 
be cate gorised as manifestly  irrational or perverse.  
14. On this understanding, Mr. Vachher ’s reliance  upon the order of 
 
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 6 of 8 
 the Supreme Cout in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) 3/2020 [ In Re: 
Cognizance for Extension of Limitation ], is also in vain. The order 
excludes the p eriod from 15.03.202 0 until 28.02.2022 from the period of 
limitation for  all legal actions . But, in the present case, the period of 
limitation would already have run out prior to 15.03.202 0.  
15. The order of the NCLT is to the same effect. The claims which 
were asserted by the petitioner herein were admittedly the same claims. 
The petitioner ’s arguments  on limitation have been dealt with in 
paragraphs 5 to 9 of the order of the NCLT as follows: - 
“5.  It is contended th at the Operational Creditor raised ce rtain 
invoices from 25.07.2014 onwards as per the terms of agreement. As 
per the terms of the agreement the Corporate Debtor would retain of 
5% of the total value of work done as a security measure, which 
would be released  after 12 months from the date of com pletion of the 
project. The Operational Creditor raised several invoices between 
07.08.2014 and 20.05.2017 amounting to Rs. 40,55,769/ - towards the 
release of retention money which is duly reflected in the ledger 
account maintained by the Operational Cr editor, in respect of 
account of Corporate Debtor for the period 01.04.2013 till 
31.03.2019. It is also contended that after 07.01.2017, no payments 
have been credited in favour of the Operational Creditor and the 
outstand ing Operational Debt of Rs. 40,55,769 /- is due for payment 
with an interest @ 18% per annum.  
6.  The date of default as declared by the Operational Creditor in 
Part IV of the application is 08.01.2017. The Operational Creditor 
issued a demand notice und er Section 8 of IBC, 2016 on 17.10.20 19 
to which the Corporate Debtor sent a reply on 26.10.2019.  
7.  The Corporate Debtor filed reply affidavit wherein a 
preliminary objection with regard to limitation has been raised. The 
Corporate Debtor contended that as per Part IV of the Section 9 
petition , an amount of Rs. 40,55,769/ - outstanding towards the 
retention amount was due since 08.01.2017. Therefore, the claim is 
barred under Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963, since, the 
present application has been filed after a period of three years. 
Learned Counsel appearing for the Corporate Debtor submitted that  
preliminary issue with regard to the limitation should be decided first 
before deciding the matter on merits.  
8.  Learned Counsel appearing for the Operatio nal Creditor  
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 7 of 8 
 submitted that the deman d notice was issued on 17.10.2019 and the 
Corporate Debtor gave a reply to the demand notice on 26.10.2019. 
Therefore, the date of default ought to be calculated from 26.10.2019.  
9.  We do not find any force in the s ubmissions of the Learned 
Counsel app earing for the Operational Creditor. It is settled law that 
the date of limitation for filing an Application under Section 9 would 
accrue from the date of default as stated by the Applicant in Part IV 
of the petition in th e present case which is 08.01.2017. T he present 
application under Section 9 of IBC having been filed on 14.02.2022 
which is beyond the period of three years since the date of default, 
this Application is barred by limitation. ” 
 
16. This order was also place d before the learned Arbitrator , and h as 
been cited  in the reasons contained in the impugned order .  
17. The learned Arbitrator has also held that the petitioner’s 
contention , that the cause of action also arose upon lapse of extended 
period of the A greement on 01.04.201 8 and subsequent dates , is 
misconceived as the period of limitation would start running on the date 
when the claims first became due. For this purpose, he has relied upon the 
judgment of the Supreme Court dated 18.05.2023 in ARB.P. 13/2023 [B 
and T AG vs. Ministry of Defence ]. It is clear therefrom that the cause of 
action for commencing arbitration proceedings begins  to run on the date 
when  the claim ant first acquired the right of action or , in the absence of 
an arbitration clause , the date on which the cause of action would have 
first accrued . This, according to the petitioner, was 08.01.2017 . 
18. For t he aforesaid reasons , I do not find any ground to interfere  with 
the findings of the learned Arbitrator that the counter claims were barred 
by limita tion, much less so in exercise of the l imited jurisdiction 
conferred  by Section 34 of the Act.  
19. The petition is therefore dismissed. All pending application also 
stand disp osed of.   
O.M.P. (COMM) 106/2024   Page 8 of 8 
 20. In view of the  petitioner’s failure to place on record  crucial 
document s, including the counter claim itself, the petitioner will pay costs 
of ₹25,000/ - to the resp ondent.

1. By way of this petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 [the Act], the petitioner assails an order of the learned Sole Arbitrator, dated 19.02.2024, by which the counter claims filed by the petitioner have been dismissed on the ground of limitation.
2. The disputes between the parties arose out of an agreement dated 10.05.2014 [the Agreement], by which the petitioner undertook to construct a tower in a project being built by the respondent. The Agreement was for a period of three years, expiring on 10.05.2017. 
3. The petitioner filed its counter claims on 19.10.2022, raising claims on account of refund of retention money, rental for its machinery deployed in the project and interest. 
4. The counter claims were originally not considered by the learned Arbitrator on the ground that they have been filed belatedly. By an order dated 08.01.2024 passed in O.M.P.(COMM) 13/2024, filed by the petitioner herein, this Court recorded an agreement between the parties that the counter claims will be taken on record by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, subject to payment of costs by the petitioner. It was inter alia directed that the learned Arbitral Tribunal may, at the request of either side, consider the question of limitation with regard to the counter claims as a preliminary issue, if it was, in the opinion of the learned Arbitrator, possible to decide the same without evidence. The impugned order dated 19.02.2024 has been made in this context. 
5. The Arbitral Tribunal has found the counter claims to be beyond the period of limitation, on the reasoning that the cause of action for filing of the counter claims had, according to the petitioner, arisen on 08.01.2017 and the counter claims had been filed only on 19.10.2022. 
6. I have heard Mr. Gursat Singh Vachher, learned counsel for the petitioner, and Mr. Pankaj Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the respondent, who appears on advance notice.
7. Mr. Vachhers principal submission is that the claim of the petitioner was on account of refund of retention money, which was to be refunded by the respondent to the petitioner only after the expiry of the defect liability period. According to him, the defect liability period of one year under the Agreement, ended on 31.03.2019, giving rise to the cause of action on 01.04.2019, and the counter claim was therefore to be filed by 01.04.2022. However, he cites the order of the Supreme Court dated 10.01.2022 in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) 3/2020 [In Re: Cognizance for Extension of Limitation], by which the Supreme Court had granted an extension of limitation for the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
8. Mr. Singh opposes this submission, on the ground that it is entirely beyond the pleadings in the counter claim filed by the petitioner. He submits that the counter claim itself stated that the amounts were payable in January 2017, and that the learned Arbitrator has correctly found that the counter claims were therefore barred by limitation. Mr. Singh has also drawn my attention to an order of the National Company Law Tribunal [NCLT] dated 18.05.2023, in proceedings instituted by the petitioner against the respondent [IB-494(ND)/2020] under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016. He submits that the counter claims raised by the petitioner before the learned Arbitral Tribunal were identical to those asserted in the petition filed before the NCLT, which was dismissed on the ground that the claims were barred by time.

9. In rejecting the petitioners counter claims on this ground, the learned Arbitrator has noticed paragraph 5 of the counter claim filed by the petitioner, and the aforesaid order of the NCLT. It may be noted that the petitioner has not placed on record either the counter claim or the order of the NCLT, although both are expressly referred to in the reasoning of the learned Arbitrator. I am unable to find any justification for withholding these basic documents, including the counter claim itself. In commercial cases, such as this one, the statement of truth contains an averment that all documents in the power, possession, control or custody of the deponent pertaining to the facts and circumstances of the proceedings have been disclosed and that the deponent is aware of the liability for action to be taken in law in the situation of any false statement or concealment. The petitioner does not appear to have followed this requirement in the present case. However, copies of the said documents have been handed over in Court by Mr. Singh, and the contents thereof are not disputed. 
10. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the counter claims are reproduced below: -
5)	That till 07.01.2017, the Respondent had made certain ad-hoc payments, in response to the constant communications which were underway between the Parties. However, after 07.01.2017, till date, no running account bill payments whatsoever had been credited in favour of the Claimant, thereby resulting in an outstanding operational debt of Rs.40,55,769/- in favour of the Claimant.

Hence, the total amount of claim that that is left unpaid by the Respondent is Rs.1,63,87,567.23/- (Inclusive of Interest of Rs. 82,90,066.23/-). The copy of interest calculation sheet is annexed as ANNEXURE-6.1

11. On the basis of these averments, the petitioner has asserted a claim of ?80,97,501/- on account of principal and a claim of ?82,90,066.23/- on account of interest, amounting to a total claim of ?1,63,87,567.23/-. It is clear from paragraph 5 above, that the petitioners contention was that the payments were due to it from 07.01.2017. 
12. The computation of interest contained in Annexure 6 to the counter claim is reproduced below:

16. This order was also placed before the learned Arbitrator, and has been cited in the reasons contained in the impugned order. 
17. The learned Arbitrator has also held that the petitioners contention, that the cause of action also arose upon lapse of extended period of the Agreement on 01.04.2018 and subsequent dates, is misconceived as the period of limitation would start running on the date when the claims first became due. For this purpose, he has relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 18.05.2023 in ARB.P. 13/2023 [B and T AG vs. Ministry of Defence]. It is clear therefrom that the cause of action for commencing arbitration proceedings begins to run on the date when the claimant first acquired the right of action or, in the absence of an arbitration clause, the date on which the cause of action would have first accrued. This, according to the petitioner, was 08.01.2017.
18. For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any ground to interfere with the findings of the learned Arbitrator that the counter claims were barred by limitation, much less so in exercise of the limited jurisdiction conferred by Section 34 of the Act.
19. The petition is therefore dismissed. All pending application also stand disposed of.
20. In view of the petitioners failure to place on record crucial documents, including the counter claim itself, the petitioner will pay costs of ?25,000/- to the respondent.

CM APPL. 13042/2024 -E-hearing (Res.).   
1. This is an application for early hea ring preferred by the 
respondent.  
2. The application is, for the reasons stated therein, allowed, and 
the writ petition is taken up for consideration today itself.  
3. The application stands disposed of.  
W.P.(C) 10193/2019  
4. The present writ petition under Articles  226 and 227 of the 
Constitution of India seeks to assail the order dated 13.05.2019 passed 
by the learned Central Administrative Tribunal (the learned Tribunal) 
in O.A.892/2019.  Vide the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 2 of 5 
 allowed the OA preferred b y the respondent by issuing the following 
directions.  
“6. We are aware of the limitations of the Tribunal in 
the context of verification of correctness of answers to 
the question in the competitive test. However, as 
regards question no.56, we expressed our  
reservations about it, in OA No.580/2019. In that 
examination, it occurred as question no.44. Direction 
was issued to refer the issue to the subject  experts. 
Whatever happened to question no.44 in that 
examination, must happen to question no. 56 in the 
present examination also.  
7. Therefore, we dispose of this OA directing that the 
respondents shall take into account, the opinion 
expressed by the experts with reference to question, 
similar to question no.56 in the test conducted for the 
post of TGT (Sansk rit). If the answer in the final key 
for the said question is found by the experts as 
correct, no further steps needs to be taken; and if on 
the other hand, any different suggestion is made, the 
same shall be taken into account, for correction of 
anomalies , if any. There shall be no order as to 
costs.”  
 
5. In support of the petition, Mr. N.K. Singh, learned counsel for 
the petitioners submits that impugned order is liable to be set aside as 
the learned Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the respondent had 
approached the learned Tribunal after the declaration of the result and 
therefore the petitioners were justified in refusing to re -examine the 
answer key at his request. After some arguments, he does not deny 
that the answer to question no. 56 as provided in the answer key was 
erroneous as also the fact that the very same question was the subject 
matter of consideration in O.A 580/2019 and upon reference to the  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 3 of 5 
 Expert Committee, the answer key to the same was found to be 
incorrect.  
6. On the other hand, Ms. M amta Sharma, learned counsel for the 
respondent supports the impugned order and contends that that once 
the views of the Expert Committee were available with the petitioners 
and they became aware  after the order passed in O.A 580/2019  that 
the answer to qu estion no. 56 as published in the answer key was 
incorrect, they ought to have taken corrective steps on their own 
before declaring the final result. She, therefore, contends that the 
petitioner itself being responsible for the wrong answer key of 
question  no. 56 having been published, the respondent cannot be made 
to suffer  especially when he had approached the petitioner much 
before the final result was declared . She, therefore, prays that the writ 
petition be dismissed .  
7. Having considered the submissions  of the learned counsel for 
the parties and perused the record, we are inclined to accept the 
respondent’s plea that once the petitioners became aware about the 
answer to question no. 56 given in the answer key being incorrect, 
they ought to have taken  appropriate corrective steps on their own.  In 
our view, once the Expert Committee appointed by the petitioner in 
O.A. 580/2019, has expressed a categoric opinion that the answer key 
to the very same question, though with regard to a different 
examination for a different post, was incorrect and the answer given 
by the respondent is correct, petitioners cannot refuse to grant marks 
to the respondent for the said question especially when she had 
approached the petitioners much before the final result was declared .  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 4 of 5 
 Furthermore, we have also perused the question no. 56, the answer 
key whereto has been challenged by the respondent, and find that the 
answer to this purely mathematical question, as urged by the 
respondent is 7/75, i.e., Option ‘C’.  
8. In the light of the aforesaid, we find no reason to interfere with 
the impugned order which directs the petitioners to correct the 
anomalies after taking into account the opinion of the Expert 
Committee, which as noted hereinabove, clearly opined that the 
answer key to questi on No. 56 was incorrect. As we find that the 
answer, i.e., Option ‘C’, given by the respondent was correct, we 
dismiss the writ petition by directing the petitioners to grant one mark 
to the respondent as also to all other similarly placed candidates who 
had marked Option C, i.e., 7/75 as their answer to Question no. 56. In 
case, after awarding one extra mark to the respondent and other 
similarly placed candidates, the total marks obtained by the 
respondent or by any other similarly placed candidate are fou nd to be 
more than the marks obtained by the last candidate in the merit list, 
the respondent and such other similarly placed candidates will 
forthwith be appointed to the post of TGT (Sanskrit) by adjusting 
them against the presently available vacancies. It is, however, made 
clear that in case the respondent or any other similarly placed 
candidate is found fit to be appointed to the aforesaid post, they will 
be entitled to receive all notional benefits w.e.f, the date , the last 
selected candidate was appoi nted. They will, however, not be entitled 
to any back wages for the period prior to the date of actual 
appointment. The exercise in terms of this order be completed within  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 5 of 5 
 eight weeks from today.  
9. The next date i.e. 25.07.2024 stands cancelled.  
10. The writ pet ition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

1. This is a petition seeking the following prayer: - 
“It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may 
be pleased to issue the writ of mandamus, direction, order or any 
other appropriate writ thereby directing the r espondents to allot 
LIG flat bearing No. 93, Third Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela, New 
Delhi under the scheme NPRS 1979 on its old/previous allotment 
rate of 1994 (30.03.1994) i.e. the old date of allotment to the 
petitioner, in the interest and furtherance of justice.”  
Brief Facts  
2. The brief facts , which are undisputed, giving rise to filing of the present 
petition are as under: - 
3. The petitioner on 24.09.1979 deposited a sum of Rs. 15 00/- as a  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 2 of 14 
 registration fee for the allotment of LIG Flat under the Delhi 
Deve lopment Authority/respondent No.1 (hereinafter “DDA”) vide 
serial  No. 75777  as per the New Pattern Registration Scheme, 1979 
(hereinafter “NPRS 1979 ”) published by the DDA.  
4. The respondent -DDA issued a certificate  of registration in favour of the 
petitione r bearing serial No. 20201 for allotment of the LIG Flat under  
NPRS 1979.  
5. On 10.02 .1987 , the petitioner admittedly sent a letter to A ssistant 
Director (R), Housing, DDA regarding change of  his address from 
Railway Quarters , Narela, Delhi – 110040 to House  No. 296/12, Arjun 
Nagar, Gurgaon, Haryana  – 122001.  
6. The petitioner was allotted Flat No . 68, Pocket 6, Sector -A-10, Narela, 
Delhi  (hereinafter “Flat No. 68”) , but since the letter was sent  to the old 
address, the petitioner did not receive the same.  The allotment of the 
petitioner for  the said flat was subsequently cancelled.  
7. On 05.06.1995, the petitioner sent a letter to the Deputy Director (N.P.) 
LIG, DDA regarding cancellation of the Flat No. 68 due to non -
payment being without any fault of the petiti oner and due to the 
negligence of the office of the respondent Nos. 1 (DDA) and 2  (LIG 
Housing DDA) .  
8. The respondent  in a mini draw subsequently all otted another LIG Flat 
bearing No. 72, Sector -10, Pocket -6, 3rd Floor, Narela, Delhi 
(hereinafter “Flat No. 72”) to the petitioner on 31.03.1998.  
9. However, since the services in Narela were  awaited at that time , no 
demand -cum-allotment letter (“DAL”)  could be  issued to the petitioner 
in this regard.  Hence, the allotment of 31.03.1998 was only a paper  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 3 of 14 
 allotment i n favour of the petitioner.  It has been stated  by the DDA  that 
on 27.12.1996, the allotment of the flat had been intimated to the 
petitioner.  
10. The office of  the respondent No. 2 published a circular vide its No. 
F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/ 114 dated 06.06.2006 that t he principal of costing 
as laid down in the office orders No. F .2(10)02/Coord(H)/49 dated 
25.02.2005 with its amendment vide office order No. 
F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/Pt./22 dated 13.02.2006 applicable in the cases of 
missing priority and change of address will be  applicable in the cases of 
registrants of NPRS 1979, who had opted for Awas Sarkar Yojna but 
had not been identified as members of the society. These r egistrants  
would continue to remain members of NPRS 1979 and would be 
entitled to the allotment of preva iling rates at that time, when they were 
entitled for allotment according  to their priority,  if the registrants ha ve 
approached DDA  within a period of 4 years. In the cases  where 
registrants ha ve not approached DDA  within a period of 4 years, the  
registran ts shall be considered for  allotment of a flat at the old cost  
prevalent at the time when he/she was  entitled for allotment + 12% 
simple  interest till the date of issue of fresh  DAL or the  current cost 
prevailing at the time of  issue of fresh DAL, which ever is lower.  
11. On 30.01.2013,  the petitioner filed an RTI application to the office of 
Dy. Director (Housing) LIG regarding allotment of flat to the petitioner 
vide its registration No. 20201 and the department replied on 
20.02.2013 that the file in question is not traceable in the records , 
however, the department assured that best efforts would  be made to 
trace out records and required information will be supplied to the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 4 of 14 
 petitioner shortly.  
12. The petitioner, through RTI  (reply dated 12.09.2013 from the 
respond ent), was able to obtain information from the office of DDA 
that the DAL was issued at the old address of Railway Narela, Delhi -
110040.  
13. In the file noting of  17.12.2014 , the Director (H) , DDA  considered the 
entire dispute and directed that the DD (LIG) ma y examine the case in 
totality and give recommendations to finally resolve the issue in 
controversy.   
14. As per the file noting of  08.05.2015, the Commissioner, LA  (Housing)  
was of the opinion  that the claim of the petitioner  appeared  to be 
genuine  as the pe titioner could not deposit the amount due to non -
receipt of the DAL , the fault was on the part of DDA . 
15. The petitioner was subsequently allotted  LIG Flat bearing No. 93, 3rd 
Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela  (hereinafter “Flat No. 93”) under 
Registration No. 202 01 and Priority No. 30845  through demand letter 
No.118821 dated 10.02.2016 subject to the payment of Rs. 15,91,505/ - 
(calculated as per the new rates) before 08.08.2016, on which date the 
allotment was to stand automatically cancelled if the deposit was no t 
made.  
16. It is this rate of  allotment that the petitioner is challenging in the 
present writ petition , stating that the flat should be allotted to the 
petitioner on the previous allotment rate of 30.03.1994  (i.e. the date of 
first allotment to the petition er) and not the new rate, on the ground that 
it was not the petitioner’s fault of not  making payment for his allotment  
in the first place .  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 5 of 14 
 17. On 08.08.2016, when the petition came up for hearing, the respondent s 
were  restrained from selling or cancelling allo tted LIG Flat No. 93, 
Third Floor, Sector F, B -2, Narela, New Delhi subject to the petitioner 
depositing Rs. 4 lakhs with the respondent -DDA .  
Submissions  (Petitioner)  
18. It is stated  by the learned counsel for the petitioner  that it is the  
respondents  who did not  send the  first allotment letter  for Flat No. 68 at 
the right address . On the petitioner’s request, another flat was allotted 
i.e. Flat  No. 72, but the said allotment letter was never issued. Hence , 
the petitioner c annot be held liable for the delays caused  by the 
respondent s themselves.  
19. It is stated that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 cannot claim a new rate for 
their own wrong s, when they have  admitted  that it was their mistake. 
Thus, the petitioner is not liable to pay a sum of Rs. 15,91,505/ - for the  
fault of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, and it is the duty of the respondent 
Nos. 1 and 2 to allot Flat No. 93  on the previous allotted rate of 1994 , 
on which date the first DAL was issued.   
20. It is stated that the flats should be allotted by DDA to the registra nts on 
its previous cost if there is no fault of the registrants. For this, reliance 
is placed upon M.P. Nauriyal v. DDA 2015:DHC:2293.  
Submissions (Respondent)  
21. The respondent -DDA in its counter -affidavit has stated that the petition 
is barred by delay an d laches, as the petitioner herein has approached 
this Court after approximately more than 18 years. Reliance is placed 
upon the judgment in Banda Development Authority v. Moti Lal 
Agarwal , (2011) 5 SCC 394 .   
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 6 of 14 
 22. Ms. Nandadevi  Deka , learned Panel Counsel for t he DDA has stated 
that in the present case, the petitioner is at fault and did not take any 
steps towards  finding out the status of his allotment from the year 1998 
to 2013.  In addition, she also relies upon the circular of the DDA 
(Housing Department) dated 13.10.2011 which reads as under: - 
“1. In partial modification of Office Orders/Circulars issued 
from time to time regarding cost of the flats allotted under 
NPRS -79, Ambedkar Awaaz Yojna and under various policies 
of DDA like wrong address policy, missi ng priority, tail -end 
priority etc., the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the 
standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area 
rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand -
cum-allotment letter i.e. date when dema nd letter under above 
policy is issued.  
2. Old cases will not be opened i.e. it should be effective only 
from the date of issue.  
This issues with the prior approval of Competent Authority.”  
Analysi s 
23. I have heard learned counsels for the parties  and peru sed the materials 
on record . 
24. In the present case , the basic facts are not in dispute.  Admittedly, the 
petitioner was registered under NPRS 1979 and made the initial 
deposit .  
25. The DAL for Flat No. 68 was sent to the old address of the petitioner  
(despite ch anged address of the petitioner being available  in the file of 
the respondent ), and hence was never received by the petitioner. The  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 7 of 14 
 allotment was thereafter cancelled. On petitioner’s 
representation/protests, another flat was allotted to the petitioner bei ng 
Flat No. 72.  The DAL for the said flat was not sent to the petitioner as 
the services in Narela were awaited at that time. The same is evident 
from the file noting of the Director (H), DDA of 17.12.2014:  
“2. Sh. Bhgwan Dass was declared successful for allotment of 
LIG flat No.68, Sec.A -10, Pkt.6, Gr/II 3rd floor, Narela on 
30.3.1994. Due to 'changed address' applied vide letter dated 
10.2.87 duly acknowledged by DDA, the demand -cum-
allotment letter could not reach him , the allotment stood 
automatically cancelled.  
3. It is further seen that DDA considered his request and 
decided to allot him a  Flat through mini draw. He was declared 
successful for Flat No.72, SecI 0, Pkt.6,  Gr.II, 3rd floor, Narela 
in the draw held on 30.3.98. However, it was decided that  
before issuance of demand -cum-allotment letter, the status of 
services in the area  was sought from Executive Engineer vide 
letter No.F54(702)94/NA/400 dated   22.8.96. No reply to this 
letter is seen placed in the file. It is seen that Sh . Bhagwan  Dass 
has been agitating through various forms for early resolution of 
his grievance.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
26. In Mohinder Singh v. DDA  2011:DHC:2834,  this Court was of the 
view that the onus is upon the DDA to ensure that the DAL is sent to 
all available addresses of t he allottee, while acting in the interest of the 
allottee.  Consequently, it was directed that allotment be made on the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 8 of 14 
 amount of initial demand made by the DDA.  It was observed as under:  
“13. In the case of Hirdayapal Singh (supra), applicant 
(petitioner i n the case) had mentioned only one address in the 
application form, but subsequently he informed the DDA about 
his permanent address and the court was of the view that once 
demand letter was returned undelivered the DDA should have 
sent the demand letter a t all the addresses available in the file 
of the DDA.  To my mind the case of the petitioner is on a better 
footing as at the time of registering herself for allotment of a 
LIG flat the petitioner along with the application form had 
enclosing his salary cer tificate issued by the school where the 
petitioner was working, filing of a copy of the salary certificate 
was a mandatory requirement and thus has to be considered to 
be a part of the form. No doubt the petitioner has been careless 
in filling up the appli cation form and not providing his 
occupational address in the column provided, but the file of the 
DDA would comprise not more than seven pages, which 
include four annexures and two pages of the application form. 
The DDA should have acted in the interest o f the allottee, a 
common citizen, who has been waiting for more than two and 
a half decades for a flat in his name. In such a situation when 
the allotment letter was received back, DDA was duty bound 
to go through the entire file to ascertain if any other address 
was available and the demand -cum allotment letter should 
have been sent at the occupational address which was 
available in file of the DDA.  The common man must derive the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 9 of 14 
 benefit of the policy dated 25.2.2005 and in my view in the facts 
of the pres ent case , once demand -cum-allotment letter was 
received back to the DDA undelivered, the DDA should have 
carefully perused the file and ensured that demand -cum-
allotment letter is sent at all the addresses available in the file.  
14. Accordingly, petition i s allowed. Rule is made 
absolute. DDA is directed to issue a demand -cum-allotment 
letter in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks from receipt 
of the order with 12 % simple interest on the amount of the 
initial demand made by the DDA .” 
(emphasis supp lied) 
27. In the present case, the first DAL of Flat No. 68 was sent at the wrong 
address. The second DAL  for Flat No. 72 was never sent to the 
petitioner . Hence, the petitioner  at no point in time was in default of not 
making the payment as demanded by the respondent s.   
28. The entire defen ce of the respondent s is two -fold. First, that the 
petitioner did not follow up with the respondent s from 1998 -2013 , and 
thus his petition  is barred by delay and laches . Second, that  the plea of 
the petitioner is not maintainab le and is against the policy/circular of 
the DDA  dated 13. 10.2011 which has been reproduced above.  
29. Both the contentions of the respondent s are misplaced. As regards the 
first objection, the petitioner , on payment of necessary charges,  was 
issued certifica te of registration bearing  Sr. No. 20201. Once the flat 
had been allotted, it was the duty of the respondent s to issue a DAL 
crystallising  the amount due and payable by the petitioner  and in case 
the petitioner  does not make the said payment, DDA  would be very  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 10 of 14 
 much  within its rights to cancel the allotment made to the petitioner . In 
the absence of the respondent s issuing any DAL, which in this case was 
firstly, sent on the wrong address (in regard to Flat No. 68), and 
secondly, never sent (in regard to Flat  No. 72), the respondent s cannot 
be permitted to state that the petitioner  should have come to the 
respondent s and asked for a DAL. In my opinion, there is no inaction 
on part of the petitioner.   
30. The respondent -DDA  has relied upon Banda Development Authori ty 
(supra) to argue that the limitation period for approaching this Court 
has expired. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:  
“17. It is true that no limitation has been prescribed for filing 
a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution b ut one of the 
several rules of self -imposed restraint evolved by the superior 
courts is that the High Court will not entertain petitions filed 
after long lapse of time because that may adversely affect the 
settled/crystallised rights of the parties. If the  writ petition is 
filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing a 
civil suit for similar cause, the High Court will treat the delay 
unreasonable and decline to entertain the grievance of the 
petitioner on merits.”  
31. In the present case, there w as no cause of action for the petitioner to 
approach the Court prior to 10.02.2016 when the respondent allotted 
Flat No. 93 to the petitioner vide Demand Letter No. 118821 . The 
petitioner is aggrieved by this letter and filed the  present writ petition 
on 0 3.08.2016  on accrual of cause of action . The petitioner cannot 
know that there were two earlier DALs as the first was sent to a wrong  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 11 of 14 
 address and the second was never issued. Hence, the petition is well 
within the limitation period . Every effort must be ma de by the DDA to 
ensure that the DAL is issued at the right address.  
32. As regards the second objection is concerned, the circular is clear that 
in case where the DDA  sends the DAL at the wrong address, the rate 
prevalent on  the date of issue of DAL is the r ate that is to be charged by 
the DDA. In the present case, the first DAL was issued in 1994,  and the  
second DAL was never issued. Since the respondent s were rectifying 
their own mistake of not issuing the DAL,  they cannot ask the 
petitioner to make payment  of the value of the flat as per the rates of 
2016  i.e. when the Demand Letter No. 118821 for Flat No. 93 was 
issued .  
33. I am of the view that there is no fault attributable to the petitioner. The 
words appearing in the circular dated 13.10.2011 , “the cost o f the flat 
in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis 
of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue 
of demand -cum-allotment letter  i.e. Date when demand letter under 
above policy is issued ” has to mean the date when the DAL was first 
issued  i.e. when it was issued  on the wrong address  in 1994.  
34. There is a reference to th e 2011 circular in the judgment of  Subodh 
Kumar v. DDA  2019:DHC:432 , wherein a Coordinate Bench of this  
Court has observed  as unde r: 
“21. ….I may nevertheless mention that, prima facie, the 
stipulation, in the said Circular, that “missing priority” cases 
would have to pay the cost of the flat as on the date when the 
flat was actually allotted to the applicant concerned, may be  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 12 of 14 
 perilo usly open to challenge as arbitrary. It is difficult to 
understand how, if the priority of an applicant has been 
missed, the blame for which would squarely lie at the doors of 
the DDA – the applicant could be made to suffer by having to 
pay a higher cost f or the flat….”  
35. I agree with this observation. The earlier wrong address polic ies of the 
DDA  stipulate that where change of address was intimated by the 
registrant but was not recorded by DDA and thereupon the letters were 
sent at the wrong address and the allottee approached the DDA within a 
stipulated time , he shall be allotted the flat on the cost prevalent at the 
time when his priority matured and no interest w ould be charged. Thus, 
being in interest of registrants, the wrong address policy afforded the  
registrants the  benefit of not having to pay for the mistakes committed 
by a government body. If the interpretation of the  circular dated  
13.10.2011  as submitted by the respondent s is to be accepted, then the 
same would take away the said benefit from the registrants , which, in 
my opinion, is unjust. The respondents,  vide this circular, have 
attempted to shirk their  responsibilities even in genuine/deserving 
cases. However, since the circular is not in challenge before me, I 
refrain from going any further.  
36. DDA is dealing with State largesse  and cannot be permitted to take 
advantage of its own wrong. Once the DAL has been issued and the 
same has been issued at the wrong address, the respondent s cannot be 
permitted to charge a premium on their oversight/mista ke by charging 
cost of the flat on the date when the new DAL is issued.  
37. Hence, it is not the petitioner who was at fault in not making the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 13 of 14 
 payment towards allotment of his flat. It was the respondent s who had 
misplaced the file of the petitioner, and also  did not send the letter to 
the right address  in the first place . As per the judicial precedents on this 
issue, the respondents were  required to take all possible efforts in 
making sure that the DAL reached the petitioner, and in the absence of 
the same, t he cancellation of allotment was untenable in law.   
38. The reliance of the petitioner on the judgment of  M.P. Nauriyal  vs. 
DDA  2015:DHC:2293  is well placed , holding that the petitioner’s case 
must succeed when the fault lies on the part of DDA. The operative 
portion of the same reads as under: - 
“25. Admittedly, DDA neither informed the petitioner about 
any pending balance towards cancellation charges to be paid 
nor gave any information that his name was not included in 
the tail -end priority list. The DDA has a lso not disputed that 
as per the policy/guidelines dated 21.05.1995 regarding cases 
where allotment was not made due to non -inclusion of the 
name of the registrants in draw, in such cases, the allotment 
shall be made in the next draw at the rates prevailin g at that 
time when the registrants would get the allotment according to 
priority position.  
… 
31. In view of the above discussion and the legal position, I 
am of the considered view that since the fault lies on the part 
of DDA, the petitioner must succeed.   
32. Accordingly, the respondent/DDA is hereby directed to 
allot a flat of the same category, if left out from the draw held  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 14 of 14 
 in February, 2008 or any other flat of the same category in 
Delhi, within six months from receipt of this order.”  
39. For the said rea sons, the present writ petition is allowed and the writ of 
mandamus is issued directing the respondent s to allot LIG Flat No. 93, 
3rd Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela, Delhi to the petitioner on the 
old/previous allotment rate of 19 94.

1. This is a petition seeking the following prayer:-
It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Honble Court may be pleased to issue the writ of mandamus, direction, order or any other appropriate writ thereby directing the respondents to allot LIG flat bearing No. 93, Third Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela, New Delhi under the scheme NPRS 1979 on its old/previous allotment rate of 1994 (30.03.1994) i.e. the old date of allotment to the petitioner, in the interest and furtherance of justice.
Brief Facts
2. The brief facts, which are undisputed, giving rise to filing of the present petition are as under:-
3. The petitioner on 24.09.1979 deposited a sum of Rs. 1500/- as a registration fee for the allotment of LIG Flat under the Delhi Development Authority/respondent No.1 (hereinafter DDA) vide serial No. 75777 as per the New Pattern Registration Scheme, 1979 (hereinafter NPRS 1979) published by the DDA. 
4. The respondent-DDA issued a certificate of registration in favour of the petitioner bearing serial No. 20201 for allotment of the LIG Flat under NPRS 1979. 
5. On 10.02.1987, the petitioner admittedly sent a letter to Assistant Director (R), Housing, DDA regarding change of his address from Railway Quarters, Narela, Delhi  110040 to House No. 296/12, Arjun Nagar, Gurgaon, Haryana  122001. 
6. The petitioner was allotted Flat No. 68, Pocket 6, Sector-A-10, Narela, Delhi (hereinafter Flat No. 68), but since the letter was sent to the old address, the petitioner did not receive the same. The allotment of the petitioner for the said flat was subsequently cancelled. 
7. On 05.06.1995, the petitioner sent a letter to the Deputy Director (N.P.) LIG, DDA regarding cancellation of the Flat No. 68 due to non-payment being without any fault of the petitioner and due to the negligence of the office of the respondent Nos. 1 (DDA) and 2 (LIG Housing DDA). 
8. The respondent in a mini draw subsequently allotted another LIG Flat bearing No. 72, Sector-10, Pocket-6, 3rd Floor, Narela, Delhi (hereinafter Flat No. 72) to the petitioner on 31.03.1998. 
9. However, since the services in Narela were awaited at that time, no demand-cum-allotment letter (DAL) could be issued to the petitioner in this regard. Hence, the allotment of 31.03.1998 was only a paper allotment in favour of the petitioner. It has been stated by the DDA that on 27.12.1996, the allotment of the flat had been intimated to the petitioner. 
10. The office of the respondent No. 2 published a circular vide its No. F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/114 dated 06.06.2006 that the principal of costing as laid down in the office orders No. F.2(10)02/Coord(H)/49 dated 25.02.2005 with its amendment vide office order No. F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/Pt./22 dated 13.02.2006 applicable in the cases of missing priority and change of address will be applicable in the cases of registrants of NPRS 1979, who had opted for Awas Sarkar Yojna but had not been identified as members of the society. These registrants would continue to remain members of NPRS 1979 and would be entitled to the allotment of prevailing rates at that time, when they were entitled for allotment according to their priority, if the registrants have approached DDA within a period of 4 years. In the cases where registrants have not approached DDA within a period of 4 years, the registrants shall be considered for allotment of a flat at the old cost prevalent at the time when he/she was entitled for allotment + 12% simple interest till the date of issue of fresh DAL or the current cost prevailing at the time of issue of fresh DAL, whichever is lower.
11. On 30.01.2013, the petitioner filed an RTI application to the office of Dy. Director (Housing) LIG regarding allotment of flat to the petitioner vide its registration No. 20201 and the department replied on 20.02.2013 that the file in question is not traceable in the records, however, the department assured that best efforts would be made to trace out records and required information will be supplied to the petitioner shortly. 
12. The petitioner, through RTI (reply dated 12.09.2013 from the respondent), was able to obtain information from the office of DDA that the DAL was issued at the old address of Railway Narela, Delhi-110040. 
13. In the file noting of 17.12.2014, the Director (H), DDA considered the entire dispute and directed that the DD (LIG) may examine the case in totality and give recommendations to finally resolve the issue in controversy.  
14. As per the file noting of 08.05.2015, the Commissioner, LA (Housing) was of the opinion that the claim of the petitioner appeared to be genuine as the petitioner could not deposit the amount due to non-receipt of the DAL, the fault was on the part of DDA.
15. The petitioner was subsequently allotted LIG Flat bearing No. 93, 3rd Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela (hereinafter Flat No. 93) under Registration No. 20201 and Priority No. 30845 through demand letter No.118821 dated 10.02.2016 subject to the payment of Rs. 15,91,505/- (calculated as per the new rates) before 08.08.2016, on which date the allotment was to stand automatically cancelled if the deposit was not made. 
16. It is this rate of allotment that the petitioner is challenging in the present writ petition, stating that the flat should be allotted to the petitioner on the previous allotment rate of 30.03.1994 (i.e. the date of first allotment to the petitioner) and not the new rate, on the ground that it was not the petitioners fault of not making payment for his allotment in the first place.
17. On 08.08.2016, when the petition came up for hearing, the respondents were restrained from selling or cancelling allotted LIG Flat No. 93, Third Floor, Sector F, B-2, Narela, New Delhi subject to the petitioner depositing Rs. 4 lakhs with the respondent-DDA. 
Submissions (Petitioner)
18. It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that it is the respondents who did not send the first allotment letter for Flat No. 68 at the right address. On the petitioners request, another flat was allotted i.e. Flat No. 72, but the said allotment letter was never issued. Hence, the petitioner cannot be held liable for the delays caused by the respondents themselves. 
19. It is stated that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 cannot claim a new rate for their own wrongs, when they have admitted that it was their mistake. Thus, the petitioner is not liable to pay a sum of Rs. 15,91,505/- for the fault of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, and it is the duty of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to allot Flat No. 93 on the previous allotted rate of 1994, on which date the first DAL was issued.  
20. It is stated that the flats should be allotted by DDA to the registrants on its previous cost if there is no fault of the registrants. For this, reliance is placed upon M.P. Nauriyal v. DDA 2015:DHC:2293. 
Submissions (Respondent)
21. The respondent-DDA in its counter-affidavit has stated that the petition is barred by delay and laches, as the petitioner herein has approached this Court after approximately more than 18 years. Reliance is placed upon the judgment in Banda Development Authority v. Moti Lal Agarwal, (2011) 5 SCC 394. 
22. Ms. Nandadevi Deka, learned Panel Counsel for the DDA has stated that in the present case, the petitioner is at fault and did not take any steps towards finding out the status of his allotment from the year 1998 to 2013. In addition, she also relies upon the circular of the DDA (Housing Department) dated 13.10.2011 which reads as under:-
1. In partial modification of Office Orders/Circulars issued from time to time regarding cost of the flats allotted under NPRS-79, Ambedkar Awaaz Yojna and under various policies of DDA like wrong address policy, missing priority, tail-end priority etc., the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand-cum-allotment letter i.e. date when demand letter under above policy is issued. 
2. Old cases will not be opened i.e. it should be effective only from the date of issue. 
This issues with the prior approval of Competent Authority. 
Analysis
23. I have heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the materials on record.
24. In the present case, the basic facts are not in dispute. Admittedly, the petitioner was registered under NPRS 1979 and made the initial deposit. 
25. The DAL for Flat No. 68 was sent to the old address of the petitioner (despite changed address of the petitioner being available in the file of the respondent), and hence was never received by the petitioner. The allotment was thereafter cancelled. On petitioners representation/protests, another flat was allotted to the petitioner being Flat No. 72. The DAL for the said flat was not sent to the petitioner as the services in Narela were awaited at that time. The same is evident from the file noting of the Director (H), DDA of 17.12.2014: 
2. Sh. Bhgwan Dass was declared successful for allotment of LIG flat No.68, Sec.A-10, Pkt.6, Gr/II 3rd floor, Narela on 30.3.1994. Due to 'changed address' applied vide letter dated 10.2.87 duly acknowledged by DDA, the demand-cum-allotment letter could not reach him, the allotment stood automatically cancelled.
3. It is further seen that DDA considered his request and decided to allot him a Flat through mini draw. He was declared successful for Flat No.72, SecI0, Pkt.6, Gr.II, 3rd floor, Narela in the draw held on 30.3.98. However, it was decided that before issuance of demand-cum-allotment letter, the status of services in the area was sought from Executive Engineer vide letter No.F54(702)94/NA/400 dated  22.8.96. No reply to this letter is seen placed in the file. It is seen that Sh. Bhagwan Dass has been agitating through various forms for early resolution of his grievance.
(emphasis supplied)
26. In Mohinder Singh v. DDA 2011:DHC:2834, this Court was of the view that the onus is upon the DDA to ensure that the DAL is sent to all available addresses of the allottee, while acting in the interest of the allottee. Consequently, it was directed that allotment be made on the amount of initial demand made by the DDA. It was observed as under:
     13. In the case of Hirdayapal Singh (supra), applicant (petitioner in the case) had mentioned only one address in the application form, but subsequently he informed the DDA about his permanent address and the court was of the view that once demand letter was returned undelivered the DDA should have sent the demand letter at all the addresses available in the file of the DDA. To my mind the case of the petitioner is on a better footing as at the time of registering herself for allotment of a LIG flat the petitioner along with the application form had enclosing his salary certificate issued by the school where the petitioner was working, filing of a copy of the salary certificate was a mandatory requirement and thus has to be considered to be a part of the form. No doubt the petitioner has been careless in filling up the application form and not providing his occupational address in the column provided, but the file of the DDA would comprise not more than seven pages, which include four annexures and two pages of the application form. The DDA should have acted in the interest of the allottee, a common citizen, who has been waiting for more than two and a half decades for a flat in his name. In such a situation when the allotment letter was received back, DDA was duty bound to go through the entire file to ascertain if any other address was available and the demand-cum allotment letter should have been sent at the occupational address which was available in file of the DDA. The common man must derive the benefit of the policy dated 25.2.2005 and in my view in the facts of the present case, once demand-cum-allotment letter was received back to the DDA undelivered, the DDA should have carefully perused the file and ensured that demand-cum-allotment letter is sent at all the addresses available in the file.
     14. Accordingly, petition is allowed. Rule is made absolute. DDA is directed to issue a demand-cum-allotment letter in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks from receipt of the order with 12 % simple interest on the amount of the initial demand made by the DDA.
(emphasis supplied)
27. In the present case, the first DAL of Flat No. 68 was sent at the wrong address. The second DAL for Flat No. 72 was never sent to the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner at no point in time was in default of not making the payment as demanded by the respondents.  
28. The entire defence of the respondents is two-fold. First, that the petitioner did not follow up with the respondents from 1998-2013, and thus his petition is barred by delay and laches. Second, that the plea of the petitioner is not maintainable and is against the policy/circular of the DDA dated 13.10.2011 which has been reproduced above. 
29. Both the contentions of the respondents are misplaced. As regards the first objection, the petitioner, on payment of necessary charges, was issued certificate of registration bearing Sr. No. 20201. Once the flat had been allotted, it was the duty of the respondents to issue a DAL crystallising the amount due and payable by the petitioner and in case the petitioner does not make the said payment, DDA would be very much within its rights to cancel the allotment made to the petitioner. In the absence of the respondents issuing any DAL, which in this case was firstly, sent on the wrong address (in regard to Flat No. 68), and secondly, never sent (in regard to Flat No. 72), the respondents cannot be permitted to state that the petitioner should have come to the respondents and asked for a DAL. In my opinion, there is no inaction on part of the petitioner. 
30. The respondent-DDA has relied upon Banda Development Authority (supra) to argue that the limitation period for approaching this Court has expired. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:
17. It is true that no limitation has been prescribed for filing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution but one of the several rules of self-imposed restraint evolved by the superior courts is that the High Court will not entertain petitions filed after long lapse of time because that may adversely affect the settled/crystallised rights of the parties. If the writ petition is filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing a civil suit for similar cause, the High Court will treat the delay unreasonable and decline to entertain the grievance of the petitioner on merits.
31. In the present case, there was no cause of action for the petitioner to approach the Court prior to 10.02.2016 when the respondent allotted Flat No. 93 to the petitioner vide Demand Letter No. 118821. The petitioner is aggrieved by this letter and filed the present writ petition on 03.08.2016 on accrual of cause of action. The petitioner cannot know that there were two earlier DALs as the first was sent to a wrong address and the second was never issued. Hence, the petition is well within the limitation period. Every effort must be made by the DDA to ensure that the DAL is issued at the right address. 
32. As regards the second objection is concerned, the circular is clear that in case where the DDA sends the DAL at the wrong address, the rate prevalent on the date of issue of DAL is the rate that is to be charged by the DDA. In the present case, the first DAL was issued in 1994, and the second DAL was never issued. Since the respondents were rectifying their own mistake of not issuing the DAL, they cannot ask the petitioner to make payment of the value of the flat as per the rates of 2016 i.e. when the Demand Letter No. 118821 for Flat No. 93 was issued. 
33. I am of the view that there is no fault attributable to the petitioner. The words appearing in the circular dated 13.10.2011, the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand-cum-allotment letter i.e. Date when demand letter under above policy is issued has to mean the date when the DAL was first issued i.e. when it was issued on the wrong address in 1994. 
34. There is a reference to the 2011 circular in the judgment of Subodh Kumar v. DDA 2019:DHC:432, wherein a Coordinate Bench of this  Court has observed as under:
21. .I may nevertheless mention that, prima facie, the stipulation, in the said Circular, that missing priority cases would have to pay the cost of the flat as on the date when the flat was actually allotted to the applicant concerned, may be perilously open to challenge as arbitrary. It is difficult to understand how, if the priority of an applicant has been missed, the blame for which would squarely lie at the doors of the DDA  the applicant could be made to suffer by having to pay a higher cost for the flat.
35. I agree with this observation. The earlier wrong address policies of the DDA stipulate that where change of address was intimated by the registrant but was not recorded by DDA and thereupon the letters were sent at the wrong address and the allottee approached the DDA within a stipulated time, he shall be allotted the flat on the cost prevalent at the time when his priority matured and no interest would be charged. Thus, being in interest of registrants, the wrong address policy afforded the registrants the benefit of not having to pay for the mistakes committed by a government body. If the interpretation of the circular dated 13.10.2011 as submitted by the respondents is to be accepted, then the same would take away the said benefit from the registrants, which, in my opinion, is unjust. The respondents, vide this circular, have attempted to shirk their responsibilities even in genuine/deserving cases. However, since the circular is not in challenge before me, I refrain from going any further. 
36. DDA is dealing with State largesse and cannot be permitted to take advantage of its own wrong. Once the DAL has been issued and the same has been issued at the wrong address, the respondents cannot be permitted to charge a premium on their oversight/mistake by charging cost of the flat on the date when the new DAL is issued. 
37. Hence, it is not the petitioner who was at fault in not making the payment towards allotment of his flat. It was the respondents who had misplaced the file of the petitioner, and also did not send the letter to the right address in the first place. As per the judicial precedents on this issue, the respondents were required to take all possible efforts in making sure that the DAL reached the petitioner, and in the absence of the same, the cancellation of allotment was untenable in law. 
38. The reliance of the petitioner on the judgment of M.P. Nauriyal vs. DDA 2015:DHC:2293 is well placed, holding that the petitioners case must succeed when the fault lies on the part of DDA. The operative portion of the same reads as under:-
25. Admittedly, DDA neither informed the petitioner about any pending balance towards cancellation charges to be paid nor gave any information that his name was not included in the tail-end priority list. The DDA has also not disputed that as per the policy/guidelines dated 21.05.1995 regarding cases where allotment was not made due to non-inclusion of the name of the registrants in draw, in such cases, the allotment shall be made in the next draw at the rates prevailing at that time when the registrants would get the allotment according to priority position.

31. In view of the above discussion and the legal position, I am of the considered view that since the fault lies on the part of DDA, the petitioner must succeed. 
32. Accordingly, the respondent/DDA is hereby directed to allot a flat of the same category, if left out from the draw held in February, 2008 or any other flat of the same category in Delhi, within six months from receipt of this order.
39. For the said reasons, the present writ petition is allowed and the writ of mandamus is issued directing the respondents to allot LIG Flat No. 93, 3rd Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela, Delhi to the petitioner on the old/previous allotment rate of 1994.

 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASMEET SINGH  
: JASMEET SINGH, J ( ORAL ) 
1. These are writ petitions filed by the petitioners seeking relief against  
the respondent -Delhi Development Au thority (hereinafter “DDA”). Since 
these petitions  raise somewhat identical issues, they are being heard and 
disposed of by a common order.  
2. W.P.(C) 15655/2004 has been filed seeking the following substantial 
prayers:  
“i) to direct a writ of certiorari the reby quashing the letter dated  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 2 of 13 
 2/1/2002 whereby the lease of the premises bearing No. B -2/228, 
Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi was illegally and arbitrarily cancelled 
by the respondents;  
ii) to direct a writ of mandamus thereby directing the respondents to 
convert the premises bearing No.B -4/228, Safdurjung Enclave from 
lease hold to free hold;  
iii) to direct the respondents to not to levy any misuse charges on the 
petitioners as there is no misuse of the premises bearing No.B - 4/228, 
Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi by the petitioners; .…” 
3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser 
charges levied by the respondent -DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:  
“i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the 
nature of Certiorar i quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P -1) 
given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;  
ii) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the 
nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to convert the 
peremises bearing No. B -4/228, Safdurjun g Enclave, New Delhi from 
lease hold to free hold for which application was submitted in the 
year 1996 (Annexure -6);….” 
Brief Facts  
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioner s participated in 
an auction and being the successful bidder s, were allotted plot No. 228, 
Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter “said 
premises/plot”) on lease -hold basis.  
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 
28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent -DDA  executed a lease deed dated  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 3 of 13 
 18.08.1980.  
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the 
construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, 
first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction 
plan. The petitio ners are using the entire premises for residential purposes.  
7. It is stated that th e petitioner s are consultant s by profession . Petitioner 
No. 1 also runs a registered  Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, “SSI 
Unit”) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to 
Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.  
8. The petitioner s are running their office from UG -5, Som Dutt 
Chamber 1, 5 , Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep 
Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.  
9. It is also stated that the petition ers were using the basement of the said 
premises for storing some equipment which , according to the petitioners,  is 
permissible under the Building Bye-laws.  
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting 
the said plot from leaseh old to freehold.  
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that t he 
lease of the petitioner s was cancelled on 26.12.2001  due to the fact  that the 
said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the 
lease, thereby mak ing it void.  
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through 
various letters, no action was taken by the respondent -DDA to restore the 
lease or convert the said plot from lease -hold to free -hold.  
13. Hence , W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed .  
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C)  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 4 of 13 
 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied 
Rs. 1,05,31,041/ - as misuse charges  calculated on the basis of the area of 
109.48 sqm .  
15. It is this misuse c harge which is sought to be quashed by the 
petitioner s in W.P.(C) 143 /2012, who state that the area of 109.48  sq. m. as 
stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents.  
Submissions  
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the pe titioner that the 
cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground 
that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non -
application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not 
preceded by any show cause notice (“SCN”) qua any alleged misuse.  
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the 
respondent -DDA along with its counter -affidavit, the SCN pertained to the 
alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the  use of subject premises for the 
purpose of “Office/Store” of an entity “Electric Enterprises”, which was 
never owned/operated by the petitione rs. Further, the cancellation letter was 
issued on the premise of an entity “Deep Jyoti Electronics”  using the 
basem ent of the premises , which was again never owned/operated by the 
petitioner s. Neither has the respondent -DDA placed any proof in this regard, 
and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-
facie  bad in law.  
18. It is further stated t hat while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 
(informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002 ), the respondent -
DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit 
documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease -hold to free - 
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 5 of 13 
 hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of 
the DDA,  the respondent -DDA took precipitative actions without there 
being any reasonable justification.  
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the 
respondent -DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide 
letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 
15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003.  
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states tha t while the alleged misuser 
began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying 
upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA  dated 17.08.2008 in 
W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are 
expected to act r easonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the 
demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to 
unreasonable exercise of power , and hence must be quashed.  
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was 
running hi s professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and 
was only using the basement for storage purposes.  
22. It is further argued that the non -application of mind in so far as the 
demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as 
available on the file of the respondent -DDA. The entire calculation of the 
misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent -DDA 
was itself not clear as to the area under misuse.  
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot i s around 1800  sq. ft. As per 
the Building Bye -Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise 
for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the 
covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 6 of 13 
 respondent -DDA  has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within  the 
permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser , and the petitioner being 
a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled 
to this protection.  
24. Mr. Birbal, learn ed standing counsel appears for the respondent -DDA 
and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was 
cancelled.  
25. As regards the misuse r charges are concerned, it is the stand of 
respondent -DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy  
and deserve to be upheld.  
Analysis  
26. I have heard learned counsel s for the parties.  
On Cancellation of Lease Deed  
27. In the counter -affidavit filed by the respondent -DDA , it has been 
stated that there are multiple  show  cause notices issued and at lea st 9 
inspections conducted by the respondent -DDA . Despite this,  only one SCN  
has been annexed  by the respondent i.e. the SCN  dated 11/15.05.1987.  
28. It was observed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies 
(P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India , (2021) 2 S CC 551  
“13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of 
civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is 
sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected 
should be given a reasonable opportunity to def end himself. The basic 
principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the 
authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the 
case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 7 of 13 
 adequate and the grounds  necessitating action and the penalty/action 
proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An 
order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and 
without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in  Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian Gener al, Evacuee Property  [Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has 
held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds 
on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable 
the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not 
satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any 
reasonable opportunity of being heard. ” 
29. A perusal of the said SCN  clearly shows that the same is vague and 
devoid of any details.  It states that the basement is being misused contrary to 
the terms and conditions of the lease.  It also does not specify  the area that is 
being misused , and further  mentions that the plot is being used as an 
office/store for the entity „Electric Enterprises‟  (which, as per the petitioner, 
is not owned/operated by him ). Truecopy of the  SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is 
reproduced herein under :-

30. A perusal of the office noting further shows that the respondent DDA 
itself is taking conflicting stance with regard to area b eing misused and its 
purpose , the details of which are as under :

109.48 sq. mtrs., and as per the 2002 
report is 12.71 sq. mtrs.  
- Respondent after going through the 
entire note sheets and assessment of 
area under misuse gives a finding that 
misuse area charges are leviable for 
an area of 19.34 sq. mts. w .e.f. 
15.01.1986 to 28.06.1999.  Pg.144 -145 
  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 11 of 13 
 31. At times, the respondent -DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to 
use the basement for the purposes  it was being used and at times that an area 
of 12.7 1 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the res pondent states 
that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations 
that the area under misuse is  19.34  sq. meters , and at times that the area 
under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters . 
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that t he respondent -DDA 
itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitione rs. 
33. Since the respondent -DDA  itself is unclear about t he area under 
misuse despite stating to have conducted numerous inspections, the SCN  
itself is vague and devoid  of the specifications of the area that is under 
misuse.  
34. The acts of the respondent -DDA is not preceded by a proper SCN 
informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no 
hearing was given to the petitioner and  despite the same,  his lea se was 
cancelled.  
35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation  of the lease 
deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B -4, Safdarjung 
Enclave, New Delhi is faulty and violates  Principals of Natural Justice.  
36. The writ petition is a llowed and the  cancellation letter  dated 
02.01.2002 is hereby set aside.  
On Misuser Charges  
37. The next question that  arises for my consideration is if there was any 
misuser and the amount to be charged for that misuser.  
38. A perusal of the writ petition of the petitioner itself shows that the 
petitioner admits that an area of 12.71 sq. meter s was being misused  as  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 12 of 13 
 storage.  
39. The same , admittedly , is contrary to the master plan, the zonal 
development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause 
II(13 ) of the lease deed  which reads as under:  
“(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor 
carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any 
building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or 
permit t he same to be used for any purpose other than that of private 
dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing 
whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, 
annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the 
neighbourhood.  
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said 
Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that 
of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such 
terms and conditions, including payment of ad ditional premium and 
additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion 
determine.  
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has 
been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for 
storage/office purpose.  Hence, for an area of 19 .34 sq. meter s, the misuser 
charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.  
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his 
client who is present in Court, is agreeable to  payment  of those charges from 
15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.  
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 13 of 13 
 misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986  till the date 
of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner 
shall make the said payment along with restoration charges , if any,  within 6 
weeks thereafter.  
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the 
application of the petitioner for conversion from lease -hold to free -hold shall 
also be de cided  by the respondent -DDA in accordance with law.   
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.  
45. Needless to add, in case the petitioner  is aggrieved by any further 
action of the respondent pursuant to the orders passed today, the petitioner  
will be at liberty to challeng e the same in accordance with law.  
46. With these directions, the petitions are disposed of.  
47. Pending applications, if any, are hereby disposed of.

1. These are writ petitions filed by the petitioners seeking relief against the respondent-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter DDA). Since these petitions raise somewhat identical issues, they are being heard and disposed of by a common order. 
2. W.P.(C) 15655/2004 has been filed seeking the following substantial prayers:
i) to direct a writ of certiorari thereby quashing the letter dated 2/1/2002 whereby the lease of the premises bearing No. B-2/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi was illegally and arbitrarily cancelled by the respondents;
ii) to direct a writ of mandamus thereby directing the respondents to convert the premises bearing No.B-4/228, Safdurjung Enclave from lease hold to free hold;
iii) to direct the respondents to not to levy any misuse charges on the petitioners as there is no misuse of the premises bearing No.B- 4/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi by the petitioners;.
3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser charges levied by the respondent-DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:
i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the nature of Certiorari quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P-1) given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;
ii) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to convert the peremises bearing No. B-4/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi from lease hold to free hold for which application was submitted in the year 1996 (Annexure-6);.
Brief Facts
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioners participated in an auction and being the successful bidders, were allotted plot No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter said premises/plot) on lease-hold basis.
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent-DDA executed a lease deed dated 18.08.1980.
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction plan. The petitioners are using the entire premises for residential purposes. 
7. It is stated that the petitioners are consultants by profession. Petitioner No. 1 also runs a registered Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, SSI Unit) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.
8. The petitioners are running their office from UG-5, Som Dutt Chamber 1, 5, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.
9. It is also stated that the petitioners were using the basement of the said premises for storing some equipment which, according to the petitioners, is permissible under the Building Bye-laws.
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting the said plot from leasehold to freehold. 
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that the lease of the petitioners was cancelled on 26.12.2001 due to the fact that the said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease, thereby making it void. 
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through various letters, no action was taken by the respondent-DDA to restore the lease or convert the said plot from lease-hold to free-hold. 
13. Hence, W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed. 
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C) 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied Rs. 1,05,31,041/- as misuse charges calculated on the basis of the area of 109.48 sqm. 
15. It is this misuse charge which is sought to be quashed by the petitioners in W.P.(C) 143/2012, who state that the area of 109.48 sq. m. as stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents. 
Submissions
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non-application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not preceded by any show cause notice (SCN) qua any alleged misuse. 
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the respondent-DDA along with its counter-affidavit, the SCN pertained to the alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the use of subject premises for the purpose of Office/Store of an entity Electric Enterprises, which was never owned/operated by the petitioners. Further, the cancellation letter was issued on the premise of an entity Deep Jyoti Electronics using the basement of the premises, which was again never owned/operated by the petitioners. Neither has the respondent-DDA placed any proof in this regard, and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-facie bad in law. 
18. It is further stated that while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 (informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002), the respondent-DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease-hold to free-hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of the DDA, the respondent-DDA took precipitative actions without there being any reasonable justification. 
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the respondent-DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003. 
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that while the alleged misuser began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA dated 17.08.2008 in W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are expected to act reasonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to unreasonable exercise of power, and hence must be quashed. 
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was running his professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and was only using the basement for storage purposes. 
22. It is further argued that the non-application of mind in so far as the demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as available on the file of the respondent-DDA. The entire calculation of the misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent-DDA was itself not clear as to the area under misuse. 
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot is around 1800 sq. ft. As per the Building Bye-Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the respondent-DDA has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within the permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser, and the petitioner being a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled to this protection. 
24. Mr. Birbal, learned standing counsel appears for the respondent-DDA and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was cancelled.
25. As regards the misuser charges are concerned, it is the stand of respondent-DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy and deserve to be upheld.
Analysis
26. I have heard learned counsels for the parties.
On Cancellation of Lease Deed
27. In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent-DDA, it has been stated that there are multiple show cause notices issued and at least 9 inspections conducted by the respondent-DDA. Despite this, only one SCN has been annexed by the respondent i.e. the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987. 
28. It was observed by the Honble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India, (2021) 2 SCC 551
13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected should be given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The basic principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be adequate and the grounds necessitating action and the penalty/action proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property [Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any reasonable opportunity of being heard.
29. A perusal of the said SCN clearly shows that the same is vague and devoid of any details. It states that the basement is being misused contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease. It also does not specify the area that is being misused, and further mentions that the plot is being used as an office/store for the entity Electric Enterprises (which, as per the petitioner, is not owned/operated by him). Truecopy of the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is reproduced herein under:-


30. A perusal of the office noting further shows that the respondent DDA itself is taking conflicting stance with regard to area being misused and its purpose, the details of which are as under:

- Respondent after going through the entire note sheets and assessment of area under misuse gives a finding that misuse area charges are leviable for an area of 19.34 sq. mts. w.e.f. 15.01.1986 to 28.06.1999.
Pg.144-145

31. At times, the respondent-DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to use the basement for the purposes it was being used and at times that an area of 12.71 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the respondent states that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations that the area under misuse is 19.34 sq. meters, and at times that the area under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters.
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that the respondent-DDA itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitioners.
33. Since the respondent-DDA itself is unclear about the area under misuse despite stating to have conducted numerous inspections, the SCN itself is vague and devoid of the specifications of the area that is under misuse.
34. The acts of the respondent-DDA is not preceded by a proper SCN informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no hearing was given to the petitioner and despite the same, his lease was cancelled.
35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation of the lease deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is faulty and violates Principals of Natural Justice.
36. The writ petition is allowed and the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is hereby set aside.
On Misuser Charges
37. The next question that arises for my consideration is if there was any misuser and the amount to be charged for that misuser.
38. A perusal of the writ petition of the petitioner itself shows that the petitioner admits that an area of 12.71 sq. meters was being misused as storage.
39. The same, admittedly, is contrary to the master plan, the zonal development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause II(13) of the lease deed which reads as under:
(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or permit the same to be used for any purpose other than that of private dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the neighbourhood.
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such terms and conditions, including payment of additional premium and additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion determine. 
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for storage/office purpose. Hence, for an area of 19.34 sq. meters, the misuser charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his client who is present in Court, is agreeable to payment of those charges from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner shall make the said payment along with restoration charges, if any, within 6 weeks thereafter.
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the application of the petitioner for conversion from lease-hold to free-hold shall also be decided by the respondent-DDA in accordance with law.	
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.
45. Needless to add, in case the petitioner is aggrieved by any further action of the respondent pursuant to the orders passed today, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge the same in accordance with law.
46. With these directions, the petitions are disposed of. 
47. Pending applications, if any, are hereby disposed of.

				JUDGMENT
 VIKAS MAHAJAN, J. (ORAL)
1. The present petition has been filed under Section 439 CrPC seeking regular bail in connection with FIR No.21/2021 under Section 376 IPC and Section 4/6 of POCSO Act registered at Police Station Ranjit Nagar.
2.  The brief facts of the case are that a statement was made by the prosecutrix wherein she alleged that she was in a relationship with the petitioner for the past two years. The petitioner called her and took her to a room in East Patel Nagar at his friends house and established physical relationship with the victim against her wishes. The prosecutrix, who was minor at that time became pregnant and the child had to be aborted, this led to the registration of the aforesaid FIR.
3. The learned counsel for the petitioner invites the attention of the Court to the statement of the victim dated 23.01.2021 recorded under Section 164 CrPC to contend that the victim has clearly stated in her statement that she had voluntarily established physical relationship with the petitioner. He submits that in yet another statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 CrPC, she has stated that she does not want any case against the petitioner and wishes to marry the petitioner.
4. He submits that it is a case of consensual romantic relationship between two young persons and the provisions of POCSO Act ought not to have been invoked in the present case.
5. The learned counsel for the petitioner invites the attention of the Court to the statement of the victim, who was examined as PW-1, to contend that the victim in her examination-in-chief has stated that her date of birth is 05.04.2003 and she has reiterated the same even when she was cross-examined by the learned APP.  Further, she has also stated that her date of birth in the school certificate i.e. 24.06.2005 is incorrect. 
6. He submits that in case the date of birth of the prosecutrix is taken as 05.04.2003 as stated by her in her testimony, it clearly shows that the prosecutrix was above 17 years of age at the time of alleged incident on 12.12.2020.
7. He submits that the petitioner is in custody since 24.08.2021 and the testimony of the victim has already been recorded, therefore, there is no possibility of the petitioner influencing the victim in the event he is enlarged on bail. He submits that the petitioner has clean antecedents and he does not have criminal record.  
8. In the backdrop of the aforesaid circumstances, he urges the Court that the petitioner may be enlarged on bail.
9. Per contra, the learned APP has argued on the lines of the Status Report.  He further submits that since the victim was a minor, therefore her consent was immaterial.
10. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, as well as, the learned APP for the State and have perused the record.
11. A perusal of victims statements under Section 164 CrPC shows that she has clearly stated that the physical relationship established between her and the petitioner was consensual and she does not want any case to be registered against the present petitioner, rather she is interested in marrying the petitioner.
12. Undoubtedly, there is material on record to prima facie indicate that the age of the prosecutrix was about 17 years of age. This Court is cognizant of the fact that though the prosecutrix was minor at the time of incident but at the same time it cannot be overlooked that she was of sufficient maturity and intellectual capacity and she joined the company of the petitioner at her own will.
13. This Court in Ajay Kumar vs State Govt. of NCT and Anr in Bail Application 2729/2022 observed that the intention of POCSO Act was to protect the children below the age of 18 years from sexual exploitation. It was never meant to criminalise consensual romantic relationships between young individuals.
14. This Court is also conscious of the fact that a Coordinate Bench in Dharmander Singh vs. State 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1267, has observed that after the charges are framed, because of the impact of Section 29 of the POSCO Act, the threshold for granting the bail will be higher. In the said case, the Court has laid down the contours within which bail application of an accused person under the POCSO Act is to be considered. The relevant part of the decision reads as under:-
74. As always, when faced with such dilemma, the court must apply the golden principle of balancing rights. In the opinion of this court therefore, at the stage of considering a bail plea after charges have been framed, the impact of section 29 would only be to raise the threshold of satisfaction required before a court grants bail. What this means is that the court would consider the evidence placed by the prosecution along with the charge-sheet, provided it is admissible in law, more favorably for the prosecution and evaluate, though without requiring proof of evidence, whether the evidence so placed is credible or whether it ex facie appears that the evidence will not sustain the weight of guilt.

xxxx			  xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

77. Though the heinousness of the offence alleged will beget the length of sentence after trial, in order to give due weightage to the intent and purpose of the Legislature in engrafting section 29 in this special statute to protect children from sexual offences, while deciding a bail plea at the post-charge stage, in addition to the nature and quality of the evidence before it, the court would also factor in certain real life considerations, illustrated below, which would tilt the balance against or in favour of the accused:

a. the age of the minor victim : the younger the victim, the more heinous the offence alleged; 
b. the age of the accused : the older the accused, the more heinous the offence alleged; 
c. the comparative age of the victim and the accused : the more their age difference, the more the element of perversion in the offence alleged; 
d. the familial relationship, if any, between the victim and the accused : the closer such relationship, the more odious the offence alleged;
e. whether the offence alleged involved threat, intimidation, violence and/or brutality; 
f. the conduct of the accused after the offence, as alleged; 
g. whether the offence was repeated against the victim; or whether the accused is a repeat offender under the POCSO Act or otherwise;
h. whether the victim and the accused are so placed that the accused would have easy access to the victim, if enlarged on bail : the more the access, greater the reservation in granting bail;
i. the comparative social standing of the victim and the accused : this would give insight into whether the accused is in a dominating position to subvert the trial;
j. whether the offence alleged was perpetrated when the victim and the accused were at an age of innocence : an innocent, though unholy, physical alliance may be looked at with less severity;
k. whether it appears there was tacit approval-in-fact, though not consent-in-law, for the offence alleged; 
l. whether the offence alleged was committed alone or along with other persons, acting in a group or otherwise; m. other similar real-life considerations.

78. The above factors are some cardinal considerations, though far from exhaustive, that would guide the court in assessing the egregiousness of the offence alleged; and in deciding which way the balance would tilt. At the end of the day however, considering the myriad facets and nuances of real-life situations, it is impossible to cast in stone all considerations for grant or refusal of bail in light of section 29. The grant or denial of bail will remain, as always, in the subjective satisfaction of a court; except that in view of section 29, when a bail plea is being considered after charges have been framed, the above additional factors should be considered.

15. oweHowever, at this stage, it is relevant to note that both the petitioner and the victim were unmarried and were almost of marriageable age. Further, they were also known to each other since both belong to Bihar.
16. Though the consent of the victim for the physical relation cannot be construed as consent-in-law but the statements of the victim recorded under Section 164 CrPC shows there was an express or tacit approval-in-fact for such physical relation. Thus, it appears to be a case of a romantic relationship between the petitioner and the victim at an age of innocence.  
17. Further the petitioner is in custody since 24.08.2021 and his custody is no more required. The testimony of the victim has already been recorded, therefore, there is no basis for any apprehension that in the event the petitioner is enlarged on bail, he will try to influence the victim.
18. It is also not the case of the prosecution that the petitioner is a flight risk or he has criminal record.
19. The object of judicial custody is to secure the presence of the accused during the trial which can be ensured by putting appropriate conditions.
20. Considering the aforesaid circumstances in entirety, this Court is of the view that the petitioner has made out a case for grant of regular bail. Accordingly, the petitioner is enlarged on bail subject to his furnishing a Personal Bond in the sum of Rs. 20,000/- and one Surety Bond of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/CMM/Duty Magistrate, further subject to the following conditions:-
a) Petitioner shall appear before the Court as and when the matter is taken up for hearing.
b) Petitioner shall provide his permanent address, as well as, his mobile number to the IO concerned.  The mobile shall be kept in working condition at all times and he shall not change the mobile number without prior intimation to the Investigating Officer concerned. 
c) Petitioner shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not communicate with or come in contact with the witnesses.

of the deceased on fire. The eye  witness further added that the mobil e phone 
was robbed and was retained by the present petitioner.  
9. Sequel to the above, the present petitioner was arrested on 08.04.2020. 
It is pertinent to note that the present petitioner was also roped in other FIR’s 
which were registered in February , 2020 in connection with the communal 
riots which took place during that time. The spot where rioting took place is 
Johripur Tiraha Nala , which is the same location where from  the deceased’s 
body was found.

10. Mr. Siddhant Sharma, learned counsel appearing on be half of the 
petitioner , at the outset , submits that the petitioner is in custody since 
08.04.2020 and is languishing in jail only beca use of the present FIR as he has 
been enlarged on bail in different FIRs vide following orders:  
(i)    Vide order dated 13 .02.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 103/2020 ; 
(ii)   V ide order dated 06.03.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 37/2020 ; 
(iii)  V ide order dated 07.03.2023,granted bail in FIR no. 35/2020 ; 
(iv)  V ide order dated 23.03.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 38/2020 ; 
(v)   V ide order dated 28.03.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 36/2020 ; 
(vi)  V ide order dated 01.04.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 102/2020 ; 
(vii) V ide order dated 5.4.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 104/2020; and  
(viii)V ide order dated 14.7.2023 , granted bail in FIR no. 149/2020.  
11. He further submits that the material eye -witnesses i.e. PW2 (Nasir 
Ahmed) and PW7 (Divesh Rajpoot) have not supported the case of the 
prosecution . PW -7 also  turned hostile  and PW -2 also resiled from his earlier 
statement on certain aspects . The other material witnesses have also been 
examined and discharged.  
12. He invites the attention of the Court to the testimony of PW2 (Nasir 
Ahmed) to contend that the testimony of PW2 is contrary to the prosecution 
version. The said witness has been cited as  eye witness.  It is the case of the 
prosecution that the incident happened on 25.02.2020 between 04-4:30 PM  
whereas PW2 during his cross -examination recorded on 02.08.2022 stated 
that “I had visited Eidgah camp on 25.02.2020 at about 2.30 / 3.00 pm and I     
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 5 of 11 
 
stayed there for about 4 hours.”   Further, during his testimony PW2 also 
wrongly identified accused Lokesh Solanki as Himanshu (petitioner).  
13. Further, drawing attention of the Court to the testimony of Divesh 
Rajpoot, who was examined as PW7, the learned co unsel submits that the said 
witness turned hostile and stated that he did not see any rioting act by the 
mob. He was cross -examined by the learned SPP and denied the suggestions 
put to him as regard the presence of the present petitioner and the overt act 
attributed to him.  
14. He submits that the material witnesses have already been examined, 
therefore, there is no possibility of petitioner influencing any material witness 
in the event he is enlarged on bail.  There is no basis for prosecution’s 
contention tha t the petitioner if enlarged on bail will tamper with evidence.  
15. He submits that co -accused Sahil Babu, Tinku, Sandeep @ Mogli, 
Vivek Panchal, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Prince and Ankit 
Chaudhary have been enlarged on bail vide order dated 03.04.2023.    
16. He further submits that another co -accused Lokesh Solanki @ Rajput in 
the present FIR was enlarged on bail vide order dated 21.07.2023, and the role 
of the petitioner and the said co -accused is alleged to be similar.  
17. He submits that the petitioner may b e extended the benefit of parity and 
the gravity of the offence cannot  be the sole ground to deny bail when all the 
other co -accused have been granted bail by the learned Trial Court.  
18. Further, the attention of the Court was drawn to the fact that the 
Petitioner has also been granted bail by the Ld. Trial Court in remaining 8 
FIRs on the ground that the material eye witnesses have been examined an d 
no other eye witnesses remain  to be examined.      
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 6 of 11 
 
19. The learned counsel for the petitioner adds that the petitioner  is in 
custody since 08.04.2020 and t he main purpose of detention is to ensure the 
availability  of accused  during the trail and if it can be ensured that the accused 
will be available for the trial, then detaining of accused person is not 
necessary.  
20. He su bmits that the prosecution has cited as many as 92 witnesses in 
total and the trail is not likely  to be concluded anytime soon, which itself 
furnishes a reason to enlarge the petitioner on bail in view of the decisions of 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Union  of India v. K.A. Najeeb , (2021) 3 SCC 
713 and Praveen Rathore v. State of Rajasthan , 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1268.  
21. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it has been 
urged by learned counsel that the petitioner be enlarged on bail.  
22. Per contra,  the learned APP appearing on behalf of the State has 
argued on the lines of the status report. He submits that the present petitioner 
has been accused of a grave and serious offence, therefore, he may not be 
enlarged on bail. He submits that the pe titioner was identified by eye witness 
PW-7 namely Divesh Rajpoot in his statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C.  
23. The learned APP submits that parity with other co -accused has not been  
established as the role of the present petitioner and evidence against  him is 
differen t tha n the co -accused persons. He submits that there is additional 
evidence against the petitioner in the form of recovery of the mobile phone of 
the deceased Murasleen and there is material to show that the said mobile 
phone was being used by the family m embers of the petitioner.  That apart, 
there is additional charge under section 412 IPC against the petitioner, 
punishable up to life imprisonment which cannot be treated as a lighter 
charge.      
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 7 of 11 
 
24. He submits “ wooden danda ” in the incident was also recovered at the 
instance of the petitioner and the subsequent opinion taken from the doctors  
who conducted the post -mortem, records that the injuries of the deceased 
could be caused by a wooden stick.  
25. The learned SPP submits that the present petitioner is the resident  of 
the same locality as the eye witnesses in the present case and connected cases, 
therefore, in case the petitioner is enlarged on bail, there are definite chances 
that the petitioner may threaten or tamper with evidence.  
26. I have heard the learned counsel  for the petitioner as well as the learned 
APP appearing on behalf of the State and perused the material on record.  
27. A perusal of the testimony of eye witness namely Divesh Rajpoot , who 
was examined as PW -7, shows that the said witness did not support the case 
of the prosecution and turned hostile. He has stated that he did not witness 
any rioting act of the mob.  
28. Similarly, the testimony of another eye witness namely Nasir Ahmed, 
who was examined as PW -2, is also contradictory to the prosecution version . 
It is the case of the prosecution that the incident happened 25.02.2020 
between 04-4:30 PM , whereas PW -2 during his cross examination has stated 
that “ I had visited Eidgah Camp on 25.02.2020 at about 2.30/3.0 0 p.m. and 
stayed there about for 4 hours.”  
29. There is also substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the 
petitioner that during his testimony PW -2 has wrongly identified accused 
Lokesh Solanki as Himanshu.  
30. Though the ev identiary value of the te stimonies  of the witnesses will be 
considered by the learned Trial Court during the course of trial. However, at 
the stage of considering the bail application, the aforesaid anomalies in the     
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 8 of 11 
 
statement of eye -witnesses cannot be overlooked which definitely enures to 
the benefit of the petitioner . 
31. In so far as the recovery of the mobile phone at the instance of the 
petitioner and the CDR records with regard to the use of the said phone by the 
family of the petitioner by inserting other SIM cards  is concerned,  the 
ultimate call with regard to its probative value will also be taken by the 
learned Trial Court  during the course of trial as the same are corroborative 
piece of evidence.  
32. Apart from the seriousness of the offence, other factors also need to be 
taken i nto consideration while considering the bail application.  
33. The prosecution has cited as many as 92 witnesses in the charge sheet 
and till date only 9 -10 witnesses have been examined, therefore, inevitably 
the trial is going to be protracted one which couple d with the fact that the 
petitioner is in custody for almost 04 years, furnishes the justification for 
granting bail to him.  
34. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan v. Balchand @ 
Balaiy , (1977) 4 SCC 308, laid down as under:  
“2. The basic rule may perhaps be tersely put as bail, not jail, except 
where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or 
thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape 
of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like, by th e 
petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the Court. We do not 
intend to be exhaustive but only illustrative.”…  
35. In Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial 
Prisoners) v. Union of India , (1994) 6 SCC 731 , it was held that under trials 
cannot indefinitely be detained pending trial. Ideally, no person ought to 
suffer adverse consequences of his acts unless the same is established before a     
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 9 of 11 
 
neutral arbiter. However, owing to the practicalities of real life wh ere to 
secure an effective trial and to ameliorate the risk to society in case a potential 
criminal is left at large pending trial, the courts are tasked with deciding 
whether an individual ought to be released pending trial or not. Once it is 
obvious that  a timely trial would not be possible and the accused has suffered 
incarceration for a significant period of time, the courts would ordinarily be 
obligated to enlarge them on bail.  
36. In K.A. Najeeb  (supra) the Hon’ble Supreme Court considering the 
absence of  possibility of timely trial and period of custody, granted bail to an 
accused under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 , observing as 
under:  
“…18.  Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact 
that the charges levelled against the res pondent are grave and a 
serious threat to societal harmony. Had it been a case at the 
threshold, we would have outrightly turned down the respondent's 
prayer. However, keeping in mind the length of the period spent by 
him in custody and the unlikelihood of  the trial being completed 
anytime soon, the High Court appears to have been left with no 
other option except to grant bail. ”…. 
37. Likewise, in Praveen Rathore  (supra) the Hon’ble Supreme Court 
considering the long custody period of four and half years’ and p ossibility of 
trial not being concluded with in reasonable time, granted bail to an accused 
charged under section 302, 120 -B IPC, observing as under:  
“5. It is not in dispute that the petitioner, by now, has undergone 
more than four and a half years' of sentence. The prosecution 
intends to examine 76 witnesses, out of whom 53 have already 
deposed. All the crucial witnesses have already been examined. The 
instant case was adjourned on few occasions to enable the 
prosecution to examine Chauthmal Kashyap and Manohar Rathore,     
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 10 of 11 
 
who were stated to be the vital witnesses. Their deposition is also 
complete.  
6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and carefu lly 
perused the material placed on record.  
7. Taking into consideration the period already spent by the 
petitioner in custody coupled with the fact that conclusion of trial 
will take some reasonable time however, without expressing any 
views on the merits of the case, we are inclined to release him on 
bail.”…  
38. Insofar as the apprehension expressed in the status report that the 
petitioner may threaten the witnesses if enlarged on bail, the said 
apprehension could be allayed by imposing appropriate condition o n the 
petitioner.  
39. That apart all co -accused of the petitioner have been enlarged on bail.  
Even the petitioner is on bail in other case FIRs as stated by the learned 
counsel for the petitioner , which fact is  not disputed by the learned SPP.  All 
material witnesses have already been examined.  
40. Considering the above factors in entirety, this Court is of the view that 
the petitioner has made out a case for grant of regular bail. Accordingly, the 
petitioner is adm itted to bail subject to his furnishing a Personal Bond in the 
sum of Rs.25,000/ - and one Surety Bond of the like amount to the satisfaction 
of the Trial Court/Jail Superintendent/Duty Magistrate, further subject to the 
following conditions: -  
a) Petitione r/accused shall not leave the country without express 
permission of the Court.   
b) Petitioner shall appear before the Court as and when the matter is 
taken up for hearing.       
BAIL APPLN. 2958/2023         Page 11 of 11 
 
c) Petitioner shall provide all mobile numbers to the IO concerned 
which shall be kept in working condition at all times and he shall 
not change the mobile number without prior intimation to the 
Investigating Officer concerned.  
d) Petitioner shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not 
communicate with or come in contact wi th the witnesses or any 
family members of the witnesses.  
41. The petition is disposed of.  
42. Nothing stated herein shall be deemed to be an expression on the merits 
of the case of the respective parties.    
43. Copy of the order be forwarded to the concerned Jail S uperintendent 
for necessary compliance.

JUDGMENT
VIKAS MAHAJAN, J.	
1. The present petition has been filed under Section 439 CrPC seeking regular bail in connection with FIR No. 156/2020 under Sections 147/148/149/201/302 IPC registered at Police Station Gokalpuri. The charges against the petitioner were framed under Sections 144/147/148/427/412/432/435/302/395 IPC r/w Section 149 IPC.
2. Vide order dated 04.09.2023, notice was issued in the bail application of the petitioner and the State was directed to file a Status Report, which is on record. 
3. The case of the prosecution as borne out from the charge-sheet is that on 28.02.2020 at 10:13 AM, information was received by police through a PCR call regarding a dead body in the Nala near Johripur Tiraha, which was later identified as that of Mursaleen s/o Sh. Yamin. The information was recorded vide DD No. 28A and entrusted to SI L.N. Sharma for necessary action. The body was shifted to GTB Hospital, where it was declared brought dead vide MLC No. BD/766/03/2020. 
4. The post-mortem of the dead body was conducted in the said hospital on 13.03.2020 by the Medical Board and as per the post mortem report, as many as five external injuries were found on the body of the deceased. Cause of death was opined as drowning.  Subsequently, an opinion regarding the type of weapon used to cause injuries was taken from the doctor who has opined that the injuries have been caused by blunt weapon. 
5. The cause of death in the case had been kept pending, therefore, initially FIR in the matter was not registered. Sh. Md. Mohsin, brother of deceased Mursaleen filed a writ petition viz., W.P.(Crl) 732/2020 before this Court. Vide order dated 16.03.2020, the Court directed for the registration of FIR in the case on the same day. 
6. In compliance with the aforesaid order, on 16.03.2020 the I.O. SI L.N. Sharma recorded statement of the complainant Ms. Nargis, wife of the deceased, who had earlier reported at Police Station Gokalpuri on 01.03.2020 that her husband was missing. 
7. During the course of investigation, the statement of the complainant/ wife of the deceased was recorded wherein she stated that her husband Murasleen was a scrap dealer by profession and on 25.02.2020 at about 12 noon, her husband left from their residence in Muradnagar to go to his workplace in Indra Vihar on his old scooter. Later in the evening at around 6 PM, she became aware of the riots in Delhi and tried to call her husband to enquire about him but he could not be reached despite several attempts as the phone was switched off. She made all efforts to search for her husband but he could not be traced. Thereafter, on 01.03.2020 she lodged a missing report of her husband. On 12.03.2020, she went to the mortuary at GTB hospital and identified the dead body of her husband. She claimed that her husband/deceased was assaulted by the rioters on 25.02.2020 as a result of which he died and his body was thrown by them in the Ganda Nala. 
8. During further course of investigation, the statements of eye-witnesses were recorded. One eye-witness namely, Divesh Rajpoot, in his statement stated that on 25.02.2020 at about 04-4:30 PM in the evening, while the eyewitness was present near the pulia, he saw a person wearing a blue colour jacket and blue jeans coming towards Bhagirathi Vihar side of the pulia from Ganga Vihar, on his cream colour scooter. He further added that this person was stopped by the mob near nala road and on being asked he disclosed his name as Mursaleen and took out a blue colour mobile phone to disclose his identity. After this, he was assaulted by the group of persons and was thrown in the sludgy water of the nala. Further, the group of persons set the scooter of the deceased on fire. The eye witness further added that the mobile phone was robbed and was retained by the present petitioner. 
9. Sequel to the above, the present petitioner was arrested on 08.04.2020. It is pertinent to note that the present petitioner was also roped in other FIRs which were registered in February, 2020 in connection with the communal riots which took place during that time. The spot where rioting took place is Johripur Tiraha Nala, which is the same location wherefrom the deceaseds body was found.  
10. Mr. Siddhant Sharma, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner, at the outset, submits that the petitioner is in custody since 08.04.2020 and is languishing in jail only because of the present FIR as he has been enlarged on bail in different FIRs vide following orders:
(i)    Vide order dated 13.02.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 103/2020;
(ii)   Vide order dated 06.03.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 37/2020;

(viii)Vide order dated 14.7.2023, granted bail in FIR no. 149/2020. 
11. He further submits that the material eye-witnesses i.e. PW2 (Nasir Ahmed) and PW7 (Divesh Rajpoot) have not supported the case of the prosecution. PW-7 also turned hostile and PW-2 also resiled from his earlier statement on certain aspects. The other material witnesses have also been examined and discharged.
12. He invites the attention of the Court to the testimony of PW2 (Nasir Ahmed) to contend that the testimony of PW2 is contrary to the prosecution version. The said witness has been cited as eye witness.  It is the case of the prosecution that the incident happened on 25.02.2020 between 04-4:30 PM whereas PW2 during his cross-examination recorded on 02.08.2022 stated that I had visited Eidgah camp on 25.02.2020 at about 2.30 / 3.00 pm and I stayed there for about 4 hours.  Further, during his testimony PW2 also wrongly identified accused Lokesh Solanki as Himanshu (petitioner).

14. He submits that the material witnesses have already been examined, therefore, there is no possibility of petitioner influencing any material witness in the event he is enlarged on bail.  There is no basis for prosecutions contention that the petitioner if enlarged on bail will tamper with evidence.
15. He submits that co-accused Sahil Babu, Tinku, Sandeep @ Mogli, Vivek Panchal, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Prince and Ankit Chaudhary have been enlarged on bail vide order dated 03.04.2023.  
16. He further submits that another co-accused Lokesh Solanki @ Rajput in the present FIR was enlarged on bail vide order dated 21.07.2023, and the role of the petitioner and the said co-accused is alleged to be similar.
17. He submits that the petitioner may be extended the benefit of parity and the gravity of the offence cannot be the sole ground to deny bail when all the other co-accused have been granted bail by the learned Trial Court. 
18. Further, the attention of the Court was drawn to the fact that the Petitioner has also been granted bail by the Ld. Trial Court in remaining 8 FIRs on the ground that the material eye witnesses have been examined and no other eye witnesses remain to be examined. 
19. The learned counsel for the petitioner adds that the petitioner is in custody since 08.04.2020 and the main purpose of detention is to ensure the availability of accused during the trail and if it can be ensured that the accused will be available for the trial, then detaining of accused person is not necessary.

K.A. Najeeb, (2021) 3 SCC 713 and Praveen Rathore v. State of Rajasthan, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 1268.
21. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it has been urged by learned counsel that the petitioner be enlarged on bail. 
22. Per contra, the learned APP appearing on behalf of the State has argued on the lines of the status report. He submits that the present petitioner has been accused of a grave and serious offence, therefore, he may not be enlarged on bail. He submits that the petitioner was identified by eye witness PW-7 namely Divesh Rajpoot in his statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C.

26. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned APP appearing on behalf of the State and perused the material on record.
27. A perusal of the testimony of eye witness namely Divesh Rajpoot, who was examined as PW-7, shows that the said witness did not support the case of the prosecution and turned hostile. He has stated that he did not witness any rioting act of the mob. 
28. Similarly, the testimony of another eye witness namely Nasir Ahmed, who was examined as PW-2, is also contradictory to the prosecution version.

29. There is also substance in the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that during his testimony PW-2 has wrongly identified accused Lokesh Solanki as Himanshu.
30. Though the evidentiary value of the testimonies of the witnesses will be considered by the learned Trial Court during the course of trial. However, at the stage of considering the bail application, the aforesaid anomalies in the statement of eye-witnesses cannot be overlooked which definitely enures to the benefit of the petitioner.
31. In so far as the recovery of the mobile phone at the instance of the petitioner and the CDR records with regard to the use of the said phone by the family of the petitioner by inserting other SIM cards is concerned, the ultimate call with regard to its probative value will also be taken by the learned Trial Court during the course of trial as the same are corroborative piece of evidence.
32. Apart from the seriousness of the offence, other factors also need to be taken into consideration while considering the bail application.
33. The prosecution has cited as many as 92 witnesses in the charge sheet and till date only 9-10 witnesses have been examined, therefore, inevitably the trial is going to be protracted one which coupled with the fact that the petitioner is in custody for almost 04 years, furnishes the justification for granting bail to him.
34. The Honble Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan v. Balchand @ Balaiy, (1977) 4 SCC 308, laid down as under:

We do not intend to be exhaustive but only illustrative.
35. In Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial Prisoners) v. Union of India, (1994) 6 SCC 731, it was held that under trials cannot indefinitely be detained pending trial. Ideally, no person ought to suffer adverse consequences of his acts unless the same is established before a neutral arbiter. However, owing to the practicalities of real life where to secure an effective trial and to ameliorate the risk to society in case a potential criminal is left at large pending trial, the courts are tasked with deciding whether an individual ought to be released pending trial or not. Once it is obvious that a timely trial would not be possible and the accused has suffered incarceration for a significant period of time, the courts would ordinarily be obligated to enlarge them on bail.
36. In K.A. Najeeb (supra) the Honble Supreme Court considering the absence of possibility of timely trial and period of custody, granted bail to an accused under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, observing as under:
18. Adverting to the case at hand, we are conscious of the fact that the charges levelled against the respondent are grave and a serious threat to societal harmony. Had it been a case at the threshold, we would have outrightly turned down the respondent's prayer. However, keeping in mind the length of the period spent by him in custody and the unlikelihood of the trial being completed anytime soon, the High Court appears to have been left with no other option except to grant bail..
37. Likewise, in Praveen Rathore (supra) the Honble Supreme Court considering the long custody period of four and half years and possibility of trial not being concluded within reasonable time, granted bail to an accused charged under section 302, 120-B IPC, observing as under: 
5. It is not in dispute that the petitioner, by now, has undergone more than four and a half years' of sentence. The prosecution intends to examine 76 witnesses, out of whom 53 have already deposed. All the crucial witnesses have already been examined. The instant case was adjourned on few occasions to enable the prosecution to examine Chauthmal Kashyap and Manohar Rathore, who were stated to be the vital witnesses. Their deposition is also complete.
6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and carefully perused the material placed on record.
7. Taking into consideration the period already spent by the petitioner in custody coupled with the fact that conclusion of trial will take some reasonable time however, without expressing any views on the merits of the case, we are inclined to release him on bail.
38. Insofar as the apprehension expressed in the status report that the petitioner may threaten the witnesses if enlarged on bail, the said apprehension could be allayed by imposing appropriate condition on the petitioner. 
39. That apart all co-accused of the petitioner have been enlarged on bail.  Even the petitioner is on bail in other case FIRs as stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner, which fact is not disputed by the learned SPP.  All material witnesses have already been examined.
40. Considering the above factors in entirety, this Court is of the view that the petitioner has made out a case for grant of regular bail. Accordingly, the petitioner is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing a Personal Bond in the sum of Rs.25,000/- and one Surety Bond of the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court/Jail Superintendent/Duty Magistrate, further subject to the following conditions:- 
a) Petitioner/accused shall not leave the country without express permission of the Court. 
b) Petitioner shall appear before the Court as and when the matter is taken up for hearing.  
c) Petitioner shall provide all mobile numbers to the IO concerned which shall be kept in working condition at all times and he shall not change the mobile number without prior intimation to the Investigating Officer concerned. 
d) Petitioner shall not indulge in any criminal activity and shall not communicate with or come in contact with the witnesses or any family members of the witnesses. 
41. The petition is disposed of. 
42. Nothing stated herein shall be deemed to be an expression on the merits of the case of the respective parties.   
43. Copy of the order be forwarded to the concerned Jail Superintendent for necessary compliance.  
44. Order dasti under the signatures of the Court Master. 
45. Order be uploaded on the website of the Court forthwith.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SAURABH BANERJEE  
 
         J U D G M E N T  
 
1. The applicant, vi de the present application under Section 439 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731, seeks regular bail in FIR No.189/2022 
dated 30.08.2022 registered under Sections 21/25 of the Narcotic Drugs and 
Psychotropic Substances Act, 19852 at Police Station Cri me Branch, Delhi.  
2. As per FIR, on 30.08.2022, Inspector Harivansh Singh directed a 
team to investigate drug trafficking in Delhi NCR. The raiding team, led by 
ASI Ravinder Kumar  while  stationed at Pole Star Public School, 
Mangolpuri, received intelligence r egarding the involvement of a bootlegger 
named Sagar, the applicant, in heroin distribution , specifically of a planned 
delivery near Gate no. 2 of Keshav Apartment, Rohini, Delhi  by him. 
                                                 
1 Hereinafter referred to as ‘ the Code ’. 
2 Hereinafter referred to as ‘ NDPS Act ’.  
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 2 of 11 
 3. ASI Ravinder communicated this information to the Inspector, who 
after obtaining requisite permission from Mr. Anil Sharma, Assistant 
Commissioner of Police3/ Anti Narcotic Task Force4, directed the ASI to 
proceed in accordance with law . Meanwhile, in compliance of Section 42 of 
the NDPS Act, the same was recorded on the CC TNS. Sensing the urgency 
of the situation, a raid was organized to intercept the applicant’s illicit 
activities at the specified location.  
4. On the fateful day , the informer identified a person on a cherry 
coloured scooty  as the applicant , whereafter, t he AS I approached the 
applicant and introduced himself and the raiding team , as also shared the 
intelligence received and informed him about his right under Section 50 of 
the NDPS Act and also offered him to search the persons on the raiding 
team and vehicles u sed by them, to which the applicant refused.  
5. Upon searching  the applicant, a black -coloured polythene bag was 
recovered from the right pocket of his bottom wear. Inside which , a 
transparent polythene bag containing a light -pink coloured powder was 
found. On testing in the field -testing kit , it was found to be heroin  weighing 
300 grams , including transparent polythene bag. The recovered contraband 
was carefully documented, packaged, sealed as evidence and labelled as 
Parcel A by ASI Ravinder Kumar . However, no contraband were recovered 
on search of the scooty  of the applicant.  This led to the registration of the 
present FIR.  
6. Of the various grounds raised by the learned counsel for the applicant, 
the learned counsel has primarily submitt ed that since the polic e acted with 
malafide  by implicating the applicant in a frivolous criminal case and his 
                                                 
3 Hereinafter referred to as ‘ Asst. CP ’. 
4 Hereinafter referred to as ‘ ANTF ’.  
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 3 of 11 
 continued incarceration after arrest is ultra vires  of his fundamental right s 
enshrined in Part III of The Constitution of India. He further submitted that 
the applican t was nabbed from Mangolpuri, Delhi and taken to Narcotic 
Cell Crime Branch, Delhi, where he was forced to sign on  a blank  paper . 
Moreover, contrary to the FIR, as no personal search or proceeding was 
conducted at the spot the same  is in blatant violation of the statutory 
mandate of the NDPS Act.  
7. Learned counsel highlighted the violation of Section 42 of the NDPS  
Act by the respondents in light of the fact that the raiding team was 
constituted on the  directions of Mr. Anil Sharma, Asst.  CP in the  ANTF , 
who was not a  gazetted officer on the date of proceedings and was merely 
holding the  functional rank of Asst. CP in the capacity of an Inspector. He, 
thereafter,  drew attention to the letter dated 06.07.2022 of the Office of the  
Commissioner of Police, Delhi5, whereby Mr. Anil Sharma was only  
assigned the functional rank of the Asst. CP,  and was yet to be notified in 
the Offic ial Gazette. To further buttress his argument, he also drew attention 
to the Circular No. 02/2023 dated 10.01.2023 issued by the CP, Delh i 
whereby a  clarification was issued that the officers holding non -substantive 
ranks i.e.  functional, look after, special grade ranks, cannot discharge duties  
bestowed, by statutes, to officers of particular rank. He, ergo, submitted that  
the raid and the recovery therefrom is bad in law and cannot stand the test of  
trial. 
8. Learned counsel then submitted that in light of the judgement of  
Supreme Court in State of Punjab vs. Balbir Singh6 and Gurjant Singh  
alias Janta vs. State of Punjab,7 the provision of Se ction 42 of the NDPS  
                                                 
5 Hereinafter referred to as ‘CP, Delhi ’ 
6 (1994) 3 SCC 299.  
7 (2014) 13 SCC 603.   
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 4 of 11 
 Act is mandatory in nature and any recovery, like the present one from the  
applicant herein, effect uated in violation of Section 42 of the NDPS Act is  
invalid in the eyes of law and thus vitiated.  
9. Learned counsel then went on to submit  that notice served upon the  
applicant under Section 50 of the NDPS Act is in the teeth of the pith and  
substance of the provision and the contraband recovered holds no  
evidentiary value as the same is tainted in the eyes of law. In this regard, he  
placed reliance upon Mohd. Jabir v. State (NCT of Delhi) 8. 
10. Learned counsel underscoring the Field Officers’ Handbook issued by 
the Narcotics Control Bureau9, submitted that the recovery is in 
contravention of the guidelines as there were no independent witness at the 
time of raid; and as no recovery proceeding was arranged ; and also as there 
was no videograph y thereof . Therefore,  as per  him, the raid and the recovery 
there upon , are prima facie  false, bogus and concocted with the sole 
intention of implicating the applicant in a false criminal case. In this regard , 
he placed reliance upon the verdict of the Supreme Court in Arif Khan alias 
Agha Khan vs. State of Uttarakhand  10 and also upon Sumit Rai alias 
Subodh Rai vs. State (NCT of Delhi)11 and Sikodh M ahto vs. Sta te12 
where in Co-ordinate benches of this Court have relied and reiterated 
opinion of the Supreme Court in  Arif Khan (supra).  
11. Learned counsel lastly placed reliance upon Maninder Singh vs. 
National investigation Agency13 and Arif Khan  (supra) to submit that 
though there are multiple FIRs against the applicant, mainly under the Delhi

 Excise Act, there have been no convictions, and the same in itself cannot 
suffice to deny regular bail to the applicant.  
12. Learned APP for the State , on the other hand , opposed the grant of 
bail in light of heinousness of the offence and severity of punishment upon 
conviction. He submitted that the accused was interrogated and his personal 
search was conducted by SI Arvind, who found Rs.10,500/ - and one mobile 
phone having SIM card of  mobile number +91 -8826636454, which were 
seized and seizure memos prepared for each of them. Subsequently on 
02.09.2022, proceedings in compliance of Section 52A of the NDPS Act 
were conducted in  the presence of a Metropolitan Magistrate . 
13. Learned APP further submit ted that the primary objection of the 
accused in terms of non -compliance of Section 42 of the NDPS Act, is 
premature as it can only  be raised/ questioned at the stage of trial but not at 
the stage of regular bail. In this regard, placing reliance  upon  Vijaysinh 
Chandubha Jadeja vs. State of Gujarat ,14 Hardeep Singh vs. State15 and 
Johri vs. State ,16 he submitted that compliance of Section 4 2 of the NDPS 
Act is purely discretionary in nature and can only be adjudicated after the 
stage of trial.  
14. Relyin g upon Johri  (supra), learned APP also submitted that 
compliance of the statutory mandate of Section 50 of the NDPS Act is a 
matter of trial, and the fact that the applicant was found at the spot  and a  
recovery of a commercial quantity of 300 grams heroin was made  from him , 
were sufficient for the embargo of Section 37 of the NDPS Act to come into 
play which forbade the grant of  regular bail. In this regard, he placed 
reliance upon Hardeep Singh  (supra).

16 2021 SCC OnLine Del 5328.   
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 6 of 11 
 15. Lastly, learned APP submit ted that the applicant has a che quered 
history  as there are 26 more FIRs register ed against him.  
16. I have  heard the learned counsel for the applicant and the learned 
APP for the State and perused the documents, including the Status Report, 
on record, as also the judgements relied upon  by the counsel(s).  
17. Going by the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the 
applicant and the opposition thereto  by the learned APP for the State, I am 
called upon to, predominantly , adjudicate  as to, firstly , whether an Officer 
holding the function ary rank of A sst. CP is empowered under Section 42 of 
the NDPS Act to authorise an officer subordinate to him to arrest such 
person or search such building, conveyance or place , secondly , whether  the 
notice served upon the applicant under Section 50 of the  NDPS Act is in 
compliance of the statutory mandates and , thirdly, whether the raiding team 
followed the Guidelines of the NCB Handbook while  making the recovery 
of the said contraband.  
18. Since, for adjudicating whether an Officer under Section 42 of the 
NDP S Act holding the functionary rank of Asst. CP is empowered under 
Section 41(2) of the NDPS Act to authorise an officer subordinate to him to 
arrest such person or search such building, conveyance or place, relevant 
extract of both Section 41(2) and Sectio n 42 of the NDPS Act are 
reproduced as under: -  
“41. Power to issue warrant and authorisation. - 
(2) Any such officer of gazetted rank  of the departments of central excise, 
narcotics, customs, revenue intelligence or any other department of the 
Central Gove rnment … … … … … may authorise any officer subordinate 
to him but superior in rank to a peon, sepoy or a constable to arrest such 
a person or search a building, conveyance or place whether by day or by 
night or himself arrest such a person or search a buil ding, conveyance 
or place .” 
  
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 7 of 11 
 “42. Power of entry, search, seizure and arrest without warrant or 
authorisation .- 
(1) … … or any such officer  (being an officer superior in rank to a peon, 
sepoy or constable) of the revenue, drugs control, excise, police or a ny 
other department of a State Government as is empowered in this behalf by 
general or special order of the State Government , if he has reason to 
believe from personal knowledge or information given by any person and 
taken down in writing that any narcotic  drug, or psychotropic substance, 
or controlled substance in respect of which an offence punishable under 
this Act has been committed or any document or other article which may 
furnish evidence of the commission of such offence or any illegally 
acquired pr operty or any document or other article which may furnish 
evidence of holding any illegally acquired property which is liable for 
seizure or freezing or forfeiture under Chapter VA of this Act is kept or 
concealed in any building, conveyance or enclosed pl ace … …”  
(emphasis supplied)  
 
19. There is no dispute that as per trite law, for giving a correct meaning 
to a word/ phrase/ term used / contained  in a Section of an Act, it has to be 
literally interpreted and is to be read as it is. Applying the said principle , on 
a bare reading of the term “… … Officer of Gazetted Rank … … ” used in 
Section 42 of the NDPS Act as it is, it transpires , rather it is apparent  that 
the legislative intent was not that such an Officer, actually, requir es a 
Notification to be published i n an Official Gazette  rather such an  Officer 
only needs to be holding the rank of a “… …Gazetted Officer… …”  upon 
due delegation through proper channel for discharging of duties as such. 
 This is so, as the term “... …Gazetted Officer… …” , in contradiction , is 
specifically used in Section 50 of the NDPS Act  and not in Section 42 of the 
NDPS Act . 
20. To summari ze in a nutshell, since an Officer who is an “… … Officer 
of Gazetted Rank … … ” under Section 42 of the NDPS Act need not , 
actually,  be a “... …Gazetted Off icer… …”  in the literal sense and further, 
since in view of the aforesaid discussions and reasonings therewith an “… 
…Officer of Gazetted Rank … … ” under Section 42 of the NDPS Act is  
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 8 of 11 
 different from a “... …Gazetted Officer… …” , such an Officer being  an “… 
…Officer of Gazetted Rank … … ” under Section 42 of the NDPS Act cannot 
be precluded from discharging his duties once duly delegated through the 
proper channel.  
21. Holding otherwise would mean carving out a new distinction against 
the very tents of the prescrib ed Statute, i.e. the NDPS Act.  
22. Thus, I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned counsel 
for the applicant that such an “… … Officer of Gazetted Rank … … ” under 
Section 42 of the NDPS Act has to be a “... …Gazetted Officer… …” . Even 
otherwise, Section 42 of the NDPS Act  envisages wide amplitude and gives 
sufficient powers to such an “… … Officer of Gazetted Rank … … ”. 
23. In view thereof, as  under the present factual circumstances  Mr. Anil 
Sharma was assigned the functional rank of Asst.  CP vide order dated 
06.07.2022, he was an “… …Officer of Gazetted Rank… …”  under Section 
42 of the NDPS Act for all practical purposes  and thus  the said Mr. Anil 
Sharma was duly empowered to issue an authorization  in terms of Section 
41(2) of the NDPS Act.  
24. Qua the conte ntions of the learned counsel for the applicant regarding  
whether the notice served upon the applicant under Section 50 of the NDPS 
Act is in compliance of the statutory mandates and whether the raiding team 
followed the guidelines in the NCB Handbook whil e making the recovery of 
the said contraband , in my opinion both of them  are subject matter of 
adjudication which can be deliberated only after trial, especially since the 
prosecution has been given a fare chance to prove his case beyond 
reasonable doubts.  In my opinion, granting regular bail to the applicant at 
this stage will be pre -mature and is likely to hamper  or may  influenc e the 
trial.  
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 9 of 11 
 25. Surely , doing so will be against the very basic tenets of law qua 
granting regular bail to an accused like the appli cant herein as is held by a 
recent judgment dated 23.11.2021 passed by a Co -ordinate Bench of this 
Court in BAIL APPLN. 3248/2021 titled Naveed Ummer Sheikh vs. 
Narcotic Control Bureau , wherein it was held as under: - 
“11. … The entire procedural defect in this regard would be tested when 
the evidence is led in this case and this is not the stage where any opinion 
can be given in favour or against the manner in drawing the samples. The 
recovered quantity is a commercial quantity hence bar of section 37 
appli es. In these circumstances, no ground for bail is made out.”  
 
26. In any event, the recovered quantity of the contraband is a 
commercial quantity, and hence the bar under Section 37 of the NDPS Act 
is applicable, which, in the aforesaid circumstances in my opi nion,  once 
again, sufficient for rejection of the present application at this stage. I find 
able support from the recent judgment passed in Narcotics Control Bureau 
vs. Mohit Agarwal17, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held as 
under:  
“18. In our opini on the narrow parameters of bail available under Section 
37 of the Act, have not been satisfied in the facts of the instant case. At this 
stage, it is not safe to conclude that the respondent has successfully 
demonstrated that there are reasonable grounds to believe that he is not 
guilty of the offence alleged against him, for him to have been admitted to 
bail. The length of the period of his custody or the fact that the charge -
sheet has been filed and the trial has commenced are by themselves not 
considera tions that can be treated as persuasive grounds for granting 
relief to the respondent under Section 37 of the NDPS Act.”  
 
27. I also find able support from another very recent  judgment passed in 
State by The Inspector of Police vs. B. Ramu18, wherein the Hon’bl e 
Supreme Court has once again after reading into the provision of Section 37 
of the NDPS Act  specifically observed as under: - 
                                                 
17 2022 SCC OnLine SC 891  
18 2024 INSC 114   
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 10 of 11 
 “9. A plain reading of statutory provision makes it abundantly clear 
that in the event, the Public Prosecutor opposes the prayer for bail 
either regular or anticipatory, as the case may be, the Court would 
have to record a satisfaction that there are grounds for believing that 
the accused is not guilty of the offence alleged and that he is not likely 
to commit any offence while on b ail.” 
 
28. Significantly, since no reasonable cause is made/ can be deduced qua  
either  the presence of the applicant or the definite role assigned to him at 
this stage  as also  the recovery of commercial quantity of the contraband 
from him cannot be denied , in the light of th ose fact s the impropriety and 
ambiguity of the notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act is insignificant, 
especially, at this stage, whence I am dealing with the grant of regular bail 
to the applicant . 
29. It is noteworthy that w hile dealing with  grant of bail, especially 
regular bail relating to the NDPS Act, I have also to bear in mind that as per 
the parliamentary debates  the NDPS Act was primarily enacted for tackling 
the drugs menace  which was mainly targeting innocent people, including 
young sters, which would have a cascading effects on, not only the present 
generations, but also on the future generations to follow  as also that the 
legislative intent enumerated in the objects and reasons of the NDPS Act is 
“.... to make stringent provisions f or the control and regulation of 
operations relating to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances... ”.  
30. Lastly, I also have to bear in mind the chequer ed history of the 
applicant , which, a s per the Nominal Roll requisitioned from the concerned 
Jail Author ities and the SCRB report  is showing that there are as many as 26 
more FIRs pending trial.  This certainly plays a major role since I have to 
counter balance the individual rights and interests of the applicant against 
the rights and interests of the societ y at large.   
BAIL APPLN. 2396 /2023              Page 11 of 11 
 31. In the wake of the aforesaid  discussion and reasonings therefor, all 
the factors hereinabove  are themselves sufficient for this Court to deny bail 
to the applicant at this stage.  I, thus,  feel there is no need for me to dwell 
upon the various j udgements cited by the learned counsel for the applicant 
as, according to me, they are of hardly any relevance.  
32. Accordingly, considering the factual matrix and circumstances 
enumerated hereinabove as well as the legal position as it stands, the present 
application is dismissed.  
33. Needless to say, any observation s made  on the merits of the matter 
are purely for the purposes of adjudicating the present application and shall 
not be construed as expressions on the merits of the matter.

Representation of the People Act, 1951, on and with effect from 27th 
September, 2013.  It is stated that in the year 2 019, the Petitioner applied and 
was allotted  “Ganna Kisan”  as its common symbol from the  list of free 
symbols published under Paragraph  10B (B) of the Election Symbol Order , 
for the general elections of the Lok Sabha for the year 2019 . 
2.1. The Petitio ner has since contested six elections ( two loc al body 
election s, two bye -elections, one House of the People election and one State 
Legis lative Assem bly election ) with the “Ganna  Kisan”  symbol.  It is stated  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 3 of 13 
 that the said symbol was also allotted  to Petitioner Pa rty by Tamil  Nadu 
State Election  Commission for the local bodies’  election s for rural  and 
urban , held durin g the years 2021 and 2022.   
2.2. It is stated that Respondent No.  1 on 14th March, 2019  and 14th 
December, 2020 has extended the c oncession under Paragraph  10(B) B of 
the Election Symbol s Order  and allo tted th e free symbol of “Ganna Kisan”  
to the Petitioner Party . It is stated that in the aforesaid facts, the Pet itioner 
Party on 9th February, 2024 requested the Election Commission of India 
(‘ECI’) i.e.,  Respondent No. 1  to allot the “Ganna Kisan”  symbol  to the  
Petitioner Party for th e upcoming  Lok Sabha election s in the y ear 2024 .  
2.3. It is stated that  however, for the said Lok Sabha elections , the 
Respondent No. 1 vide its communication (s)/letter (s) dated  13th February, 
2024 and  20th February, 2024 (‘impugned letter’)  has directed the Returning  
Officers to allot free symbol - “Ganna Kisan” to the candidates set up by 
Respondent No. 2  in the State  of Tamil Nadu  and Puducherry . It is stated 
that Respondent No.  2 contested Karna taka General Assembly elections 
with the s ymbol of ‘Gas Cylinder ’ in the year 2023.   
3. It is stated that the Petitioner Party sent its representation s on 19th 
February, 2024 and 24th February , 2024 to Respondent No. 1  seeking 
cancelation of the allotment of  “Ganna Kisan”  symbo l to Responde nt No. 2 
and to allot the s aid symbol to the Petitioner Party  for the  Lok Sabha 
elections, 2024 . 
4. The learned senior counsel a ppearing for the Petitioner  states the 
Petitioner  Party is a registered ( unrecogn ized) State party  and is therefore,  
not entitled to a reserved election symbol . She states that consequently, the  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 4 of 13 
 Petitioner  Party has to apply for allotment of a free symbol  as per Election 
Symbols Order , whenever it intends to contest the general elections.  
3.1. She states that “Ganna Kisan”  symbol was allotted  to the Petitioner 
Party by Respondent No. 1/ECI for the elections held during the year s 2019 
to 2023.  
3.2. She states tha t the  Petitioner Party has contested in the State 
Legislature A ssembly Elections, 2021 for the  State of Tamil Nadu and 
Puducherry , by setting up its candidates in all the 234 constituencies in 
Tamil Nadu and 28 constituencies in the Union Territory of Puduch erry. She 
states the Petitioner Party has secured a voting share of 6.87% in State 
Electi ons, 2021 and recognized  as the third largest registered political party 
in the State of Tamil Nadu ; therefore, the people of Tamil Nadu associate  
the symbol of ‘Ganna Ki san’ with the Petitioner Party.  
3.3. She states that as per the communication dated 17th May,  2023  
published on the websit e of Respondent No. 1 , an application seeking 
allotment of free symbol should be filed from 17th December, 2023 . She 
states that as per applicable rules , the ap plication for allotment of the free 
symbol can  be made by the  party  till atleast  three months before the date of 
expir y of the term of the House of the People.  
3.4. She states that Petitioner Party has fil ed its application for allotment 
of “Ganna Kisan”  symbol on 9th February, 2024, which was within the 
permissible time period for  filing such an application. She states that as per 
the Proviso 2 to the Explanation (iv) of Paragraph 10B (B)  of the Election 
Symbol s Order , if two parties  file their respective application s on the ‘same 
date’, giving preference for the same symbol, then the symbol will be  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 5 of 13 
 allotted to the applic ant to whom the said symbol was allotted at the 
previous occasion  as well. 
3.5. She states t hat however, the Respondent No. 1  by its letter s dated 13th 
February, 2024  and 20th February, 2024 , has directed the Returning Officer 
to allot “Ganna Kisan”  symbol to Respondent No. 2 only on the basis of the 
prior application filed by the Respondent  No. 2, on 17th December,  2023 , for 
the Lok Sabha elections in 2024 , in several States including the State of 
Tamil  Nadu .  
3.6. She states that in the present w rit petition, the P etitioner Party is 
challenging Explanation (iv) and Proviso 1 to the said Explanation of 
Paragraph  10B (B) of the Electio n Symbol s Order . She states that the 
impugned explanation  and provis o thereto  are arbitrary an d violates Article 
14 of the Constitution  of Ind ia. She states that the election symbol has 
critical relevance in the election  process  and t he voters in the State of Tamil 
Nadu identif y the said symbol with the Petitioner Party . She state s that so 
long as the  application  for allotment is filed within the v alid window  period , 
it must be considered  by Respondent No. 1 and accorded th e preference  
contemplated in Provi so 2. She pleads that the phrase ‘ same da te’ appearing 
in the impugned Proviso to Explanation (iv) to Paragraph 10B (B)  should be 
appropriately recas t and re -phrased by this Court , so as to direct Respondent 
No. 1 to consider al l valid applications received  within the valid window  
period to gether for the purposes of allot ment .  
3.7. She states that the policy of ‘first-come-first-served’ which  forms the 
basis of this impugned Proviso is unconstitutional in light of the law laid 
down by  the Supreme Court of India  in the case of Anant Raj Limited. vs.  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 6 of 13 
 State of Haryana  and O thers1.  
4. In reply, the learned standing counsel for the Respondent No. 1/ECI 
states that as per Explanation (iv) to Paragraph  10B (B), Election Symbol s 
Order , the allotment of the free symbol by Respondent N o. 1 has to be done 
on ‘first -come -first-served’ basis. He states the Petitioner Party filed its 
application on 9th February, 2024, whereas Respondent No. 2  filed its 
applicatio n on 17th December, 202 3 and ther efore, the “Ganna Kisan”  
symbol wa s duly allotted  to Respondent No. 2 on 13th February on ‘first -
come -first-served’ basis  in acc ordanc e with the scheme . He contends that if 
the plea of  quashing or re-casting the impugned  proviso (s) is allowed by this 
Court, then it would destroy the underline fundamental basis  of Paragraph  
10B (B) of the Election Symbol s Order . He sta tes that the recasting would 
dilute the distinction between reserved s ymbols and free s ymbol s. He further 
submits that an unrecognized  politic al party is not entitled, as a mat ter of 
right, for exclusive allotment of a free symbol and Explanation (iv) of 
Paragraph 10B ( B) read with Paragraph nos. 5 and 6 of the Election 
Symb ols Order , clearly indicates the legislative  intent ion, that the al lotment 
of free symbol to an unrecognised  party has to  be done on ‘first -come-first-
served’ basis . He state s that the Petitioner Party itself has been a beneficiar y 
of the  said provisions  when it earlier applied and was allotted “Ganna 
Kisan”  as its common symb ol on 14th March, 2019  and 14th December, 
2020.      
4.1. He states that there is no dis pute that Respondent No. 2 applied first 
and has been allotted the free symbol in acco rdance with Paragraph  10B ( B) 
 
1 (2022 ) 15 SCC 596 paras 32 , 35 and 40   
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 7 of 13 
 of the Election Symbol s Order  and therefore, th ere is no arbit rariness . He 
states tha t the present writ petition is not maintai nable and relies upon the 
judgment of Gu jarat High Court in ‘Vyavastha  Parivartan  Party Through 
Convenor Vishnubha K  Pandya v. Election Commiss ion of I ndia’2 to 
contend that in similar fa cts the writ was dismissed by the said High Court.  
5. We ha ve considered the submissions of  the learned senior counsel for 
the Petitioner  as well as learned standing counsel for the Respondent No. 1 
and peruse d the record.  
6. The Petitioner Party is aggrieved by the action  of the Respondent No. 
1/ECI, whereby the free sym bol “Ganna Kisan” has been  allotted to 
Respondent No. 2  for the Lok Sabha  elections  in the State  of Tamil  Nadu 
and Puducherry  for 2024.    
7. The Petitione r Party admits t hat Respondent No. 1 on 17th May, 2023 
duly published on its website that application seeking concession for 
allotment of free symbol , to contest the up coming elections to Lok  Sabha 
should be filed f rom 17th December, 2023 . Admittedly, t he application f or 
allotment of the free symbol - “Ganna Kisan” , was filed by Respondent No. 
2 on 17th December, 2023 at 1 0:01 A.M ., whereas the  Petitioner Party filed 
its application on 9th February, 2024 . Therefore, i n accordance with  
Explanation  (iv) to Paragraph 10B (B) the E lection  Symbol s Order , the said 
free symbol was allotted  to Respondent No. 2.  
8. The Petitioner Party fairly admits that allotment of the free symbol 
“Ganna Kisan”  to Respondent No. 2 has been  made in acco rdance with  the 
procedure laid down in Paragraph  10B ( B) of the E lection  Symbol s Order . 
 
2 R/Special Civil Application No. 5356 of 2019, Order dated 27th March 2019   
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 8 of 13 
 However , feeling aggrieved by the said allotment , it seeks to chal lenge the 
same  by contending  that the procedure  laid down in Paragraph  10B (B) 
Expla nation (iv)  and Proviso (s) 1 and 2  to the said Explanation , which  led to 
the allotment in fa vour of Respondent No. 2 are unconst itutional.  The said 
Explanation  (iv) and Provisos  thereto reads as under : -  
“[10B - Concessio n to candidates set up by registered (unrecognized) 
parties and to unrecognized parties which were earlier recognized parties 
more than 6 years back.  
….. 
(iv) Allotment of common symbol under this paragraph shall be done on 
‘first-come -first-served’ basis :  
Provide d that if applications of two or more parties giving preference for 
the same symbol are received in the Commission on t he same date , then 
the question of  allotment of the symbol to one of such parties shall be 
decided by draw of lots in such manne r as may be directed by the 
Commission :  
Provided  further that if out of the two or more such parties giving 
preference for the same symbol whose applications are received on the 
same date , one party is such that it had been allotted the said symbol at 
the previous  occasion i n the State concerned and the other was no t allotted 
that symbol in the previous election, then the symbol s hall be allotted to 
the former : 
Provided  also that if out of the two or more such parties giving preference 
for the same symbol whose applications are received on the same date , 
both or all such parties had been allotted the said symbol on the previous 
occasion in the State concerned, and one among the parties is such that it 
has Member(s) elected to the House of the People or the Legislati ve 
Assembly  of the State concerned on the symbol for which preference has 
been given by the party, then the symbol shal l be allotted to that party to 
the exclu sion of the other parties; ” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
9. A plain reading  of the impugned Explanat ion along with its Proviso (s) 
clearly shows  that the said provision is based on the principle of ‘first-come -
first-served’ basis and to achieve this object, and the objective criteria  of 
determination of the ‘first’ applicant has been fixed as the ‘date’ on which 
the applicati on for allotment of  the symbol is received  by Res pondent N o. 1.  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 9 of 13 
 The criteria of  ‘date’ appears consistently  in each of the three provisos to 
Explanation ( iv) and therefore, the metho d applie s uniformly  in it s 
application .   
10. The content ion of the Petitioner Party that this Court should recas t 
Proviso (s) 1 and 2  so as to  replace the phrase ‘same date ’ therein with 
appropriate words /phraseology , so as , to permit equal consideration to all 
valid applications received  by Respondent No. 1, within the permissible 
wind ow period , cannot b e acceded  to. Firstly, t he submission of the 
Petitioner  Party  ignores th e repetitive  occurrence  of the ph rase ‘same da te’ 
as it appears in each of the three  Proviso (s) to the said Explanation (iv). 
Secondly, t he consequence of alleged re-casting  of the said Proviso (s) 1 and 
2 as sought  by the Petition er Party would render  otiose  the Explanation (iv) 
itself , which provi des that th e allotment wi ll be made on  the principle of  
‘first-come -first-served ’ basis. The suggestion of the Peti tioner, if a ccepted 
would do v iolence to Explanation (iv).  Thirdly , it is well -settled principle of 
law that t he Court cannot  rewrite  the statu te. This principle has been  
expressly  laid down  by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgment o f 
Union of Indi a and An other vs. D eoki Nand an Aggarwal3, wherein 
paragraph  14 reads as under : -  
“14. We are at a loss to understand the reasoning of the learned Judges in 
reading down the provisions in paragraph 2 in force prior to November 1, 
1986 as “more than five years”  and as “more than four years” in the same 
paragraph for the period subsequent to N ovember 1, 1986. It is not  the duty 
of the court either to e nlarge the scope of the legislation or the intention 
of the legislature when the language of t he provision is plain and 
unambiguous. The court cannot rewrite, recast or  reframe the legislation  
for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The power to 
 
3 (1992) Supp (1) SCC 323   
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 10 of 13 
 legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The court cannot add 
words to a statute or read words i nto it which are not there.  Assuming 
there is a defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature th e 
court could not go to its aid to  correct or make up the deficiency. Courts 
shall decide what the law is and not what it should  be. The court of course 
adopts a construction which wil l carry out the ob vious intention of the 
legislature but could not legislate itself. But to invoke judicial activism to 
set at naught legislative judgment is subversive of the constitutional 
harmony and comity of instru mentalities . ….. 
………… Modifying and altering the scheme and applying it to others 
who are not ot herwise  entitled to under the scheme, will not also come 
under the principle of affirmative action adopted by courts sometimes in 
order to av oid discrimination . If we may say so, what the High Cour t has 
done in this  case is a clear and naked usurpation of legislative power. ” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
10.1. This principle was also reiterated  by the Supreme Court of India  in its 
judgment V. Jagannadha Rao and Others v. State of A.P. and Others  4.  
10.2. The restraint  on the powers of the Court in re-writing a statu te has 
been emphasized  by the Constitution Be nch of the Sup reme Court in India 
in the matter of In Re: Expeditious  Trial o f Cases under Section 13 8 of NI  
Act 18815, wherein it was observed  as under:  - 
“20. ...Conferring power o n the court by reading certain words into 
provisions is impermissible. A Judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to 
enlarge nor to contract it.  Whatever temptations the statesmanship of 
policy -making might wisely suggest, construction must eschew interpol ation 
and evisceration. He must not read in by way of  creation . The Judge's duty 
is to interpret and apply the law, not to change it to meet the Judge's idea of 
what justice require s. The court cannot add words to a statute or read 
words  into it which are  not there .”  
(Emphasis supplied)  
10.3. The scheme of Explanation (iv) and its Proviso (s) including the 
Proviso 1 are consistent , non -discriminatory  and appl y uniformly to all 
eligible applic ants. The language  of the impugned Explanation and Proviso 
 
4 (2001) 10 SCC 401  at para 18  
5 (2021 ) 16 SCC 116   
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 11 of 13 
 1 is pla in and unambiguous . There is no scope for reading into Pro viso 1 the 
plea cont ended by the P etitioner by replacing the phrase ‘same date ’ with 
‘within  permissible time peri od’. A reaso nable preference  for political 
parties to whom the symbol has been  allotted in the previous election and 
political parties  who have  elected representatives  is also duly recognized  in 
Proviso 2 and Pro viso 3 , respectively . The Petitioner has therefore been 
unable to show that the said impugned Expl anation and Proviso  1 is 
unconstitutional.  
10.4. During the course of the arguments, the Peti tioner ha s also sought to 
challeng e the vires  of the phrase ‘same date ’ as it appears in Proviso 2 to 
Explanation (iv). Though, there is no chal lenge to Proviso 2 either in the 
writ petition or in the pr ayer, however, for the same reasons as recorded 
hereina bove , the challenge to Proviso 2 is also not maintainable.   
10.5. This Court is of the view that if the plea of the Petitioner Party is 
accepted, the same will operate against the essence of ‘free symbols ’, as it 
will take away the rights and benefits granted to the unrecognised political 
parties to contest the elections with a free and common symbol . The 
Petitioner  by the proposed re -phrasing  is seeking to retain an  advantage for 
the registered unrecognized  political parties to get continued access to a 
particular free sy mbol  and theref ore indirectly converting  a free symbol into 
a reserved symbol . 
11. The Petitioner fa irly concedes that the information with re spect to the 
‘first date ’ for receiving  applications on 17th December, 2023 , was pu blished 
by Respondent N o 1 on 17th May, 2023 , several months in advance  and the 
Petitione r had due notice of the same . The Petitioner Party , who had earlier  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 12 of 13 
 applied and availed of the al lotment  of the free symbol  on 14th March, 20 19 
and 14th December, 2020 was well awar e of the meth odology of ‘first-come -
first-served ’ basis at  Paragraph  10B (B) , Explanation (iv) of the Election 
Symbol Order . In thes e facts, the reli ance placed by the Petitioner on the 
judgment of Anan t Raj Ltd. (Supra) is whol ly inapplicable as  in the facts of 
that case, the Court came to the con clusion , that there was no suffic ient 
public notice of the policy to the applicants and h ad le d to preferential  
allotments, which were held to be ag ainst public interest and  violative of 
Article 14 of the Constitution.  Needless to add  that in the said case , the 
Court concluded  that the p rinciple of ‘first-come -first-served ’ was being 
misu sed in the ali enation of the pu blic property , as the  policy introduced by  
the State Governme nt with regards  to grant of license of its own  land for 
constructio n for the development of group housing society was unfair and 
against  the public policy.   It would be relev ant to refer to the paragraph 
relied upon by the Petit ioner which read as under: -  
“32. When we ca ll the term “established practice”, it always refers to a 
regular, con sistent, predictable and certain conduct, process or activity of 
the decision -making authority and being the State functionary, its character 
is supposed to be based on the requirement of higher degree of fairness i n 
administrative action to be test ed on the anvil of Article 14 of the 
Constitution.  
35. That apart, there is a fundamental flaw  in the policy o f the State of first -
come -first-serve basis as it involves an eleme nt of pure chanc e or accident 
and it indeed has inherent in -built implications and thi s factor cannot be 
ruled out as we have gone through the record , any person who has an 
access to the power corridors will be made available with an information 
from the Government records and before there could be a  public notice 
accessible to the p eople at large, the interested person may submit his 
application, as happened in the instant c ase, and become entitled to stand 
first included in queue to have a better claim , at the same time it is the 
solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non -discriminatory  method is 
adopted , whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own  
 
W.P.(C) 3162/2024   Page 13 of 13 
 land, or alienation of property and it is imperative and of paramount 
consideration that every action of the State should always be in public 
interest .  
40. In our  considered view, the principle of first -come -first-serve basis 
which has been adopted by the respondent State  in the facts of the instant 
case is neither held to be rational no r in public inte rest and is in violation of 
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. ” 
(Emphasis supplied)  
11.1.  However, in the facts of  this case, the Petitio ner as noted above, was 
fully aware of the ‘first’ acceptance date for application as  17th December, 
2023  and its significance in the scheme  of Par agraph 10B (B) of the Election 
Symbols Order  and had made use of the same to its advantage in the p ast. 
We are therefore , of the  considered opinion that the allotment of the free 
symbol “Ganna kisan ” by Respondent No. 1 in fa vour of Respondent  No. 2 
by the impugned letters is neither arbitrary nor unconstitutional . 
12. We ac cordingly , find no merit in the present petition and the same is 
dismissed along with  pending  applications.

W.P.(C) 3162/2024 & CM APPL. 13000/2024
1. Present writ petition has been filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India seeking following prayers: -
a.  Pass a writ of Certiorari or any other writ/order/direction of like nature by striking down Explanation (iv) and Proviso 1 to Explanation (iv) of Order 10B (B) of the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 (Election Symbols Order).

c. Pass a writ of Certiorari or any other writ/order/direction of like nature by quashing the communication dated 20.02.2024 sent by the Respondent No. 1.
d. Pass a writ of Certiorari or any other writ/order/direction of like nature, directing the Respondent No. 1 to allot Ganna Kisan to the Petitioner party in the upcoming Lok Sabha Parliamentary election in the State of Tamil Nadu, based upon the representation dated 24.02.2024 given by the Petitioner Party to Respondent No. 1
2. The Petitioner Party herein, namely, Naam Tamilar Katchi, is an unrecognized political party in India, registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, on and with effect from 27th September, 2013. It is stated that in the year 2019, the Petitioner applied and was allotted Ganna Kisan as its common symbol from the list of free symbols published under Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbol Order, for the general elections of the Lok Sabha for the year 2019.
2.1. The Petitioner has since contested six elections (two local body elections, two bye-elections, one House of the People election and one State Legislative Assembly election) with the Ganna Kisan symbol. It is stated that the said symbol was also allotted to Petitioner Party by Tamil Nadu State Election Commission for the local bodies elections for rural and urban, held during the years 2021 and 2022. 
2.2. It is stated that Respondent No. 1 on 14th March, 2019 and 14th December, 2020 has extended the concession under Paragraph 10(B) B of the Election Symbols Order and allotted the free symbol of Ganna Kisan to the Petitioner Party. It is stated that in the aforesaid facts, the Petitioner Party on 9th February, 2024 requested the Election Commission of India (ECI) i.e., Respondent No. 1 to allot the Ganna Kisan symbol to the Petitioner Party for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in the year 2024. 
2.3. It is stated that however, for the said Lok Sabha elections, the Respondent No. 1 vide its communication(s)/letter(s) dated 13th February, 2024 and 20th February, 2024 (impugned letter) has directed the Returning Officers to allot free symbol - Ganna Kisan to the candidates set up by Respondent No. 2 in the State of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry. It is stated that Respondent No. 2 contested Karnataka General Assembly elections with the symbol of Gas Cylinder in the year 2023. 
3. It is stated that the Petitioner Party sent its representations on 19th February, 2024 and 24th February, 2024 to Respondent No. 1 seeking cancelation of the allotment of Ganna Kisan symbol to Respondent No. 2 and to allot the said symbol to the Petitioner Party for the Lok Sabha elections, 2024.
4. The learned senior counsel appearing for the Petitioner states the Petitioner Party is a registered (unrecognized) State party and is therefore, not entitled to a reserved election symbol. She states that consequently, the Petitioner Party has to apply for allotment of a free symbol as per Election Symbols Order, whenever it intends to contest the general elections.
3.1. She states that Ganna Kisan symbol was allotted to the Petitioner Party by Respondent No. 1/ECI for the elections held during the years 2019 to 2023.
3.2. She states that the Petitioner Party has contested in the State Legislature Assembly Elections, 2021 for the State of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, by setting up its candidates in all the 234 constituencies in Tamil Nadu and 28 constituencies in the Union Territory of Puducherry. She states the Petitioner Party has secured a voting share of 6.87% in State Elections, 2021 and recognized as the third largest registered political party in the State of Tamil Nadu; therefore, the people of Tamil Nadu associate the symbol of Ganna Kisan with the Petitioner Party. 
3.3. She states that as per the communication dated 17th May, 2023 published on the website of Respondent No. 1, an application seeking allotment of free symbol should be filed from 17th December, 2023. She states that as per applicable rules, the application for allotment of the free symbol can be made by the party till atleast three months before the date of expiry of the term of the House of the People.
3.4. She states that Petitioner Party has filed its application for allotment of Ganna Kisan symbol on 9th February, 2024, which was within the permissible time period for filing such an application. She states that as per the Proviso 2 to the Explanation (iv) of Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order, if two parties file their respective applications on the same date, giving preference for the same symbol, then the symbol will be allotted to the applicant to whom the said symbol was allotted at the previous occasion as well.
3.5. She states that however, the Respondent No. 1 by its letters dated 13th February, 2024 and 20th February, 2024, has directed the Returning Officer to allot Ganna Kisan symbol to Respondent No. 2 only on the basis of the prior application filed by the Respondent No. 2, on 17th December, 2023, for the Lok Sabha elections in 2024, in several States including the State of Tamil Nadu. 
3.6. She states that in the present writ petition, the Petitioner Party is challenging Explanation (iv) and Proviso 1 to the said Explanation of Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order. She states that the impugned explanation and proviso thereto are arbitrary and violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India. She states that the election symbol has critical relevance in the election process and the voters in the State of Tamil Nadu identify the said symbol with the Petitioner Party. She states that so long as the application for allotment is filed within the valid window period, it must be considered by Respondent No. 1 and accorded the preference contemplated in Proviso 2. She pleads that the phrase same date appearing in the impugned Proviso to Explanation (iv) to Paragraph 10B (B) should be appropriately recast and re-phrased by this Court, so as to direct Respondent No. 1 to consider all valid applications received within the valid window period together for the purposes of allotment. 
3.7. She states that the policy of first-come-first-served which forms the basis of this impugned Proviso is unconstitutional in light of the law laid down by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Anant Raj Limited. vs. State of Haryana and Others1. 
4. In reply, the learned standing counsel for the Respondent No. 1/ECI states that as per Explanation (iv) to Paragraph 10B (B), Election Symbols Order, the allotment of the free symbol by Respondent No. 1 has to be done on first-come-first-served basis. He states the Petitioner Party filed its application on 9th February, 2024, whereas Respondent No. 2 filed its application on 17th December, 2023 and therefore, the Ganna Kisan symbol was duly allotted to Respondent No. 2 on 13th February on first-come-first-served basis in accordance with the scheme. He contends that if the plea of quashing or re-casting the impugned proviso(s) is allowed by this Court, then it would destroy the underline fundamental basis of Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order. He states that the recasting would dilute the distinction between reserved symbols and free symbols. He further submits that an unrecognized political party is not entitled, as a matter of right, for exclusive allotment of a free symbol and Explanation (iv) of Paragraph 10B (B) read with Paragraph nos. 5 and 6 of the Election Symbols Order, clearly indicates the legislative intention, that the allotment of free symbol to an unrecognised party has to be done on first-come-first-served basis. He states that the Petitioner Party itself has been a beneficiary of the said provisions when it earlier applied and was allotted Ganna Kisan as its common symbol on 14th March, 2019 and 14th December, 2020.    
4.1. He states that there is no dispute that Respondent No. 2 applied first and has been allotted the free symbol in accordance with Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order and therefore, there is no arbitrariness. He states that the present writ petition is not maintainable and relies upon the judgment of Gujarat High Court in Vyavastha Parivartan Party Through Convenor Vishnubha K Pandya v. Election Commission of India2 to contend that in similar facts the writ was dismissed by the said High Court.
5. We have considered the submissions of the learned senior counsel for the Petitioner as well as learned standing counsel for the Respondent No. 1 and perused the record.
6. The Petitioner Party is aggrieved by the action of the Respondent No. 1/ECI, whereby the free symbol Ganna Kisan has been allotted to Respondent No. 2 for the Lok Sabha elections in the State of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry for 2024.   
7. The Petitioner Party admits that Respondent No. 1 on 17th May, 2023 duly published on its website that application seeking concession for allotment of free symbol, to contest the upcoming elections to Lok Sabha should be filed from 17th December, 2023. Admittedly, the application for allotment of the free symbol - Ganna Kisan, was filed by Respondent No. 2 on 17th December, 2023 at 10:01 A.M., whereas the Petitioner Party filed its application on 9th February, 2024. Therefore, in accordance with Explanation (iv) to Paragraph 10B (B) the Election Symbols Order, the said free symbol was allotted to Respondent No. 2.
8. The Petitioner Party fairly admits that allotment of the free symbol Ganna Kisan to Respondent No. 2 has been made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order. However, feeling aggrieved by the said allotment, it seeks to challenge the same by contending that the procedure laid down in Paragraph 10B (B) Explanation (iv) and Proviso(s) 1 and 2 to the said Explanation, which led to the allotment in favour of Respondent No. 2 are unconstitutional. The said Explanation (iv) and Provisos thereto reads as under: - 
[10B - Concession to candidates set up by registered (unrecognized) parties and to unrecognized parties which were earlier recognized parties more than 6 years back.
..
(iv) Allotment of common symbol under this paragraph shall be done on first-come-first-served basis: 
Provided that if applications of two or more parties giving preference for the same symbol are received in the Commission on the same date, then the question of allotment of the symbol to one of such parties shall be decided by draw of lots in such manner as may be directed by the Commission: 
Provided further that if out of the two or more such parties giving preference for the same symbol whose applications are received on the same date, one party is such that it had been allotted the said symbol at the previous occasion in the State concerned and the other was not allotted that symbol in the previous election, then the symbol shall be allotted to the former:
Provided also that if out of the two or more such parties giving preference for the same symbol whose applications are received on the same date, both or all such parties had been allotted the said symbol on the previous occasion in the State concerned, and one among the parties is such that it has Member(s) elected to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned on the symbol for which preference has been given by the party, then the symbol shall be allotted to that party to the exclusion of the other parties;
(Emphasis supplied)
9. A plain reading of the impugned Explanation along with its Proviso(s) clearly shows that the said provision is based on the principle of first-come-first-served basis and to achieve this object, and the objective criteria of determination of the first applicant has been fixed as the date on which the application for allotment of the symbol is received by Respondent No. 1. The criteria of date appears consistently in each of the three provisos to Explanation (iv) and therefore, the method applies uniformly in its application.  
10. The contention of the Petitioner Party that this Court should recast Proviso(s) 1 and 2 so as to replace the phrase same date therein with appropriate words/phraseology, so as, to permit equal consideration to all valid applications received by Respondent No. 1, within the permissible window period, cannot be acceded to. Firstly, the submission of the Petitioner Party ignores the repetitive occurrence of the phrase same date as it appears in each of the three Proviso(s) to the said Explanation (iv). Secondly, the consequence of alleged re-casting of the said Proviso(s) 1 and 2 as sought by the Petitioner Party would render otiose the Explanation (iv) itself, which provides that the allotment will be made on the principle of first-come-first-served basis. The suggestion of the Petitioner, if accepted would do violence to Explanation (iv). Thirdly, it is well-settled principle of law that the Court cannot rewrite the statute. This principle has been expressly laid down by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgment of Union of India and Another vs. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal3, wherein paragraph 14 reads as under: - 
14. We are at a loss to understand the reasoning of the learned Judges in reading down the provisions in paragraph 2 in force prior to November 1, 1986 as more than five years and as more than four years in the same paragraph for the period subsequent to November 1, 1986. It is not the duty of the court either to enlarge the scope of the legislation or the intention of the legislature when the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous. The court cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate. The power to legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there. Assuming there is a defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature the court could not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency. Courts shall decide what the law is and not what it should be. The court of course adopts a construction which will carry out the obvious intention of the legislature but could not legislate itself. But to invoke judicial activism to set at naught legislative judgment is subversive of the constitutional harmony and comity of instrumentalities. ..
 Modifying and altering the scheme and applying it to others who are not otherwise entitled to under the scheme, will not also come under the principle of affirmative action adopted by courts sometimes in order to avoid discrimination. If we may say so, what the High Court has done in this case is a clear and naked usurpation of legislative power.
(Emphasis supplied)
10.1. This principle was also reiterated by the Supreme Court of India in its judgment V. Jagannadha Rao and Others v. State of A.P. and Others 4. 
10.2. The restraint on the powers of the Court in re-writing a statute has been emphasized by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in India in the matter of In Re: Expeditious Trial of Cases under Section 138 of NI Act 18815, wherein it was observed as under: -
20. ...Conferring power on the court by reading certain words into provisions is impermissible. A Judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to enlarge nor to contract it. Whatever temptations the statesmanship of policy-making might wisely suggest, construction must eschew interpolation and evisceration. He must not read in by way of creation. The Judge's duty is to interpret and apply the law, not to change it to meet the Judge's idea of what justice requires. The court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there. 
(Emphasis supplied)
10.3. The scheme of Explanation (iv) and its Proviso(s) including the Proviso 1 are consistent, non-discriminatory and apply uniformly to all eligible applicants. The language of the impugned Explanation and Proviso 1 is plain and unambiguous. There is no scope for reading into Proviso 1 the plea contended by the Petitioner by replacing the phrase same date with within permissible time period. A reasonable preference for political parties to whom the symbol has been allotted in the previous election and political parties who have elected representatives is also duly recognized in Proviso 2 and Proviso 3, respectively. The Petitioner has therefore been unable to show that the said impugned Explanation and Proviso 1 is unconstitutional. 
10.4. During the course of the arguments, the Petitioner has also sought to challenge the vires of the phrase same date as it appears in Proviso 2 to Explanation (iv). Though, there is no challenge to Proviso 2 either in the writ petition or in the prayer, however, for the same reasons as recorded hereinabove, the challenge to Proviso 2 is also not maintainable. 
10.5. This Court is of the view that if the plea of the Petitioner Party is accepted, the same will operate against the essence of free symbols, as it will take away the rights and benefits granted to the unrecognised political parties to contest the elections with a free and common symbol. The Petitioner by the proposed re-phrasing is seeking to retain an advantage for the registered unrecognized political parties to get continued access to a particular free symbol and therefore indirectly converting a free symbol into a reserved symbol.
11. The Petitioner fairly concedes that the information with respect to the first date for receiving applications on 17th December, 2023, was published by Respondent No 1 on 17th May, 2023, several months in advance and the Petitioner had due notice of the same. The Petitioner Party, who had earlier applied and availed of the allotment of the free symbol on 14th March, 2019 and 14th December, 2020 was well aware of the methodology of first-come-first-served basis at Paragraph 10B (B), Explanation (iv) of the Election Symbol Order. In these facts, the reliance placed by the Petitioner on the judgment of Anant Raj Ltd. (Supra) is wholly inapplicable as in the facts of that case, the Court came to the conclusion, that there was no sufficient public notice of the policy to the applicants and had led to preferential allotments, which were held to be against public interest and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Needless to add that in the said case, the Court concluded that the principle of first-come-first-served was being misused in the alienation of the public property, as the policy introduced by the State Government with regards to grant of license of its own land for construction for the development of group housing society was unfair and against the public policy.  It would be relevant to refer to the paragraph relied upon by the Petitioner which read as under: - 
32. When we call the term established practice, it always refers to a regular, consistent, predictable and certain conduct, process or activity of the decision-making authority and being the State functionary, its character is supposed to be based on the requirement of higher degree of fairness in administrative action to be tested on the anvil of Article 14 of the Constitution.
35. That apart, there is a fundamental flaw in the policy of the State of first-come-first-serve basis as it involves an element of pure chance or accident and it indeed has inherent in-built implications and this factor cannot be ruled out as we have gone through the record, any person who has an access to the power corridors will be made available with an information from the Government records and before there could be a public notice accessible to the people at large, the interested person may submit his application, as happened in the instant case, and become entitled to stand first included in queue to have a better claim, at the same time it is the solemn duty of the State to ensure that a non-discriminatory method is adopted, whether it is for distribution or allotment of licence on his own land, or alienation of property and it is imperative and of paramount consideration that every action of the State should always be in public interest. 
40. In our considered view, the principle of first-come-first-serve basis which has been adopted by the respondent State in the facts of the instant case is neither held to be rational nor in public interest and is in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
(Emphasis supplied)
11.1.  However, in the facts of this case, the Petitioner as noted above, was fully aware of the first acceptance date for application as 17th December, 2023 and its significance in the scheme of Paragraph 10B (B) of the Election Symbols Order and had made use of the same to its advantage in the past. We are therefore, of the considered opinion that the allotment of the free symbol Ganna kisan by Respondent No. 1 in favour of Respondent No. 2 by the impugned letters is neither arbitrary nor unconstitutional.
12. We accordingly, find no merit in the present petition and the same is dismissed along with pending applications.

        (Emphasis Supplied)  
2. The Petitioner’s case, in brief, is that the Respondent No.2 – Delhi Jal 
Board (‘DJB’) had awarded a works contract to the Respondent No. 7 – 
Chinnar Shipping & Infrastructure  (India) Pvt. Ltd., in the year 2013  
(‘erstwhile tender’)  for dredging and desilting of Yamuna River. It is stated 
that h owever, the Respondent No.7 in the garb of de -silting of Yamuna 
River, had actually indulged in the illegal act of extraction of sand from the 
said river and made illegal gains by selling it.  
2.1. It is stated that an Original Application being O.A. No. 168/2017 was 
filed in this regard before the Principal Bench, National Green Tribunal, 
Delhi (‘NGT’), wherein the NGT observed that the activity of Respondent 
cannot be termed as ‘de -silting simpliciter’. The NGT accordingly, disposed 
of the said O.A. vide order dated 24th August, 2015, constituting a 
committee of officials of various government authorities with direction to 
consider the material placed before  NGT and submit their recommendations 
to the GNCTD for passing of appropriate orders.  
2.2. It is stated that the matter was thereafter, also consider ed by Lokpal of 
India  (‘Lokpal’)  in a complaint bearing no. 3574/2022.  
3. Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that the urgent relief sought 
in the present proceedings is the stay of the award of the tender by the DJB 
to Respondent No. 8,  with respect to “DREDGING OF SILT FROM RIVER  
 
W.P.(C) 3102/2024    Page 4 of 7 
 YAMUNA NEAR INTAKE IN THE DJB PONDAGE AREA AT WAZIRABAD WAT ER 
WORKS vide N.I.T. NO. 03 2023 -24) RE -INVITE ” dated 11th September, 2023 . He 
states that in fact, the contract for dredging should be split up from the 
contract for lifting of the sand. He states that this work should be awarded to 
two s eparate contractors so as to avoid illegal exploitation of the valuable  
natural resource i.e., sand. He states that the modus of splitting the work of 
dredging and lifting into two separate contracts has also been  adopted by the 
Government of Andra Pradesh. He states that the Petitioner has filed CM 
APPL. 12766/2024 seeking a restraint against Respondent No. 2 from 
proceeding with the award of tender during the pendency of this petition  and 
is praying for an interim stay .  
3.1. He states that the Petitioner is a  public -spirited person and has no 
personal interest in the matter. He states that the Petitioner has collected the 
documents filed as annexures  to this writ petition from the documents 
available on the official website of the Government Departments.  
4. In reply, learned coun sel for Respondent No. 2 states that in 
pursuance to the directions dated 1st March, 2023 , issued by the Lokpal , the 
Respondent No. 2 has instituted a suit for recovery of the balance amount of 
Rs. 38,18,648/ - from the erstwhile contractor  i.e., Respondent No. 7. She 
states that a sum of Rs. 732.78 lacs already stand recovered  from 
Respondent No. 7  as recorded in the said order. She relies upon the contents 
of the order dated 01st March, 2023 passed by the Lokpal.  
5. Having considered the submissions of the co unsel  for the Petitioner as 
well as Respondent No. 2 and upon perusal of the record, we are of the 
considered opinion that the present petition cannot be maintained as a  PIL.  
 
W.P.(C) 3102/2024    Page 5 of 7 
 A perusal of the prayer -III of th is PIL and the interim prayer sought in CM 
APPL. 12766/2024, for stay of the tender, is indicative of the fact that the 
present petition does not espouse any genuine cause . 
6. Further, a  perusal of the final order dated 1st March, 2023 , passed by 
the Lokpal shows that in the said proceedings , in pursuance  to a complaint 
dated 7th June, 2022 , a preliminary report was sought by the Lokpal from the 
Central Vigilance Commission (‘CVC’). The said order records that a 
preliminary enquiry report was submitted by Central Vigilance Officer 
(‘CVO’) of the DJB. Thereafter, a second report was sought from the CVO. 
The first and second report submitted by CVO DJB in 2023 were  duly 
considere d by the Lokpal , in this order  and it returned the following 
findings: -  
“We have considered the report of the CVO, DJB received thr ough CVC 
provided in the report. It emerges from the report that  decisions in the 
instant case were taken at multiple stages by various officials dealing with 
the respective issues. The allegations levelled in the complaint against the 
public servant i.e.  Chairperson/Chairman, DJB could not be 
substantiated. It has also been informed, inter alia, that all due payments 
of dredgi ng work were adjusted towards recovery of lifted material and no 
net payment was released to the agency after Hon'ble NGT Order date d 
15.04.2015. With vigorous pursuance with the agency, an amount of 
Rs.732.78 lakhs has been recovered from the agency for the lifted dredged 
material including encashment of bank guarantee, forfeiture of security, 
deposition in cash, etc. as per details given in the report. Balance payment 
of Rs.38,18,648/ - remains to be recovered from the agency which is being 
pursued by the DJB. The contract has also been terminated on 04.02.2022 
due to non -fulfilment of contractual obligation by the Agency.  
In view of the above, we direct that the balance amount of Rs.38, 
18,648/ - may be recovered from the agency as early as possible and a 
compliance report may be submitted by the DJB through CVC to the 
Lokpal Secretariat within a period of four weeks i.e. on or before 
07.04.2023. ” 
 
7. The issue of allegations of wrongdoings by the officials of DJB and  
 
W.P.(C) 3102/2024    Page 6 of 7 
 the recovery of the royalty amount from Re spondent No. 7 has been noted in 
the said proceedings. The Lokpal has also issued directions to DJB to 
recover the outstanding amoun t from Respondent No. 7 and as stated by 
DJB, the appropriate proceedings stand instituted. The computation of the 
royalty amount was also a subject matter of scrutiny before the Lokpal and 
the report submitted by the CVO, DJB on this aspect has been accepted by 
the Lokpal.  
8. The Petitioner in the present proceedings seeks  to challenge the DJB’s 
computation of the royalty amount , recovered from the erstwhile contractor 
in the present petition , and has set out its contra computation at para 6.16 of 
this petiti on. In our considered opinion, the alleged computation is prima 
facie based on surmises and is unsubstantiated from the record.  The said 
facts and figures cannot form the basis of initiating an enquiry in the writ 
proceedings.  The contentions at para 6.16 raises disputed questions of fact, 
which would require leading of evidence and even otherwise cannot be 
adjudicated upon in the writ petition. The prayers (I) and (VI) therefore, 
cannot be maintained.  
9. The Petitioner further seeks a direction to CVC i.e., Respondent No. 3 
to hold an enquiry with respect to award and implementation of the 
erstwhile tender  in favour of Respondent No. 7 during the extended period . 
However, as noted above, in the proceedings  before  the Lokpal,  this issue  
was referred to CVC , which investigated it and reported back to the Lokpal.  
Therefore, prayer (IV)  cannot be maintained for an action which has alr eady 
been undertaken .  
10. The proceedings before the Lokpal record that Rs. 732. 78 lacs  
 
W.P.(C) 3102/2024    Page 7 of 7 
 towards royalty already stand recovered by DJB from the Respondent No. 7. 
The Lokpal directed DJB to initiate proceedings for recovery of a balance 
sum of Rs. 38,18,648  towards royalty . As noted above, as per the learned 
counsel for DJB, the civil suit has already been filed. In view thereof,  the 
prayer (VII) does not arise for consideration.  
11. As noted above, we are not persuaded that the present petition has 
been filed in public interest. We are not persuaded by the credentials of the 
Petitioner who has filed this petition . Further, in view of the fact that 
Lokpal , NGT  and CVC have  already enquired into the same issue/ matter 
and the facts alleged in the petition ha ve been duly considered by the said 
authorities, we find no material in the present petition for directing re -
enquiry. In view of the aforesaid observations, we do not find any merit in 
the present petition and the same is dismissed  along with  pending  
applications .

								(Emphasis Supplied)
2. The Petitioners case, in brief, is that the Respondent No.2  Delhi Jal Board (DJB) had awarded a works contract to the Respondent No. 7  Chinnar Shipping & Infrastructure (India) Pvt. Ltd., in the year 2013 (erstwhile tender) for dredging and desilting of Yamuna River. It is stated that however, the Respondent No.7 in the garb of de-silting of Yamuna River, had actually indulged in the illegal act of extraction of sand from the said river and made illegal gains by selling it. 
2.1. It is stated that an Original Application being O.A. No. 168/2017 was filed in this regard before the Principal Bench, National Green Tribunal, Delhi (NGT), wherein the NGT observed that the activity of Respondent cannot be termed as de-silting simpliciter. The NGT accordingly, disposed of the said O.A. vide order dated 24th August, 2015, constituting a committee of officials of various government authorities with direction to consider the material placed before NGT and submit their recommendations to the GNCTD for passing of appropriate orders. 
2.2. It is stated that the matter was thereafter, also considered by Lokpal of India (Lokpal) in a complaint bearing no. 3574/2022.
3. Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that the urgent relief sought in the present proceedings is the stay of the award of the tender by the DJB to Respondent No. 8, with respect to DREDGING OF SILT FROM RIVER YAMUNA NEAR INTAKE IN THE DJB PONDAGE AREA AT WAZIRABAD WATER WORKS vide N.I.T. NO. 03 2023-24) RE-INVITE dated 11th September, 2023. He states that in fact, the contract for dredging should be split up from the contract for lifting of the sand. He states that this work should be awarded to two separate contractors so as to avoid illegal exploitation of the valuable natural resource i.e., sand. He states that the modus of splitting the work of dredging and lifting into two separate contracts has also been adopted by the Government of Andra Pradesh. He states that the Petitioner has filed CM APPL. 12766/2024 seeking a restraint against Respondent No. 2 from proceeding with the award of tender during the pendency of this petition and is praying for an interim stay. 
3.1. He states that the Petitioner is a public-spirited person and has no personal interest in the matter. He states that the Petitioner has collected the documents filed as annexures to this writ petition from the documents available on the official website of the Government Departments.
4. In reply, learned counsel for Respondent No. 2 states that in pursuance to the directions dated 1st March, 2023, issued by the Lokpal, the Respondent No. 2 has instituted a suit for recovery of the balance amount of Rs. 38,18,648/- from the erstwhile contractor i.e., Respondent No. 7. She states that a sum of Rs. 732.78 lacs already stand recovered from Respondent No. 7 as recorded in the said order. She relies upon the contents of the order dated 01st March, 2023 passed by the Lokpal.
5. Having considered the submissions of the counsel for the Petitioner as well as Respondent No. 2 and upon perusal of the record, we are of the considered opinion that the present petition cannot be maintained as a  PIL. A perusal of the prayer-III of this PIL and the interim prayer sought in CM APPL. 12766/2024, for stay of the tender, is indicative of the fact that the present petition does not espouse any genuine cause.
6. Further, a perusal of the final order dated 1st March, 2023, passed by the Lokpal shows that in the said proceedings, in pursuance to a complaint dated 7th June, 2022, a preliminary report was sought by the Lokpal from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC). The said order records that a preliminary enquiry report was submitted by Central Vigilance Officer (CVO) of the DJB. Thereafter, a second report was sought from the CVO. The first and second report submitted by CVO DJB in 2023 were duly considered by the Lokpal, in this order and it returned the following findings:- 
We have considered the report of the CVO, DJB received through CVC provided in the report. It emerges from the report that decisions in the instant case were taken at multiple stages by various officials dealing with the respective issues. The allegations levelled in the complaint against the public servant i.e. Chairperson/Chairman, DJB could not be substantiated. It has also been informed, inter alia, that all due payments of dredging work were adjusted towards recovery of lifted material and no net payment was released to the agency after Hon'ble NGT Order dated 15.04.2015. With vigorous pursuance with the agency, an amount of Rs.732.78 lakhs has been recovered from the agency for the lifted dredged material including encashment of bank guarantee, forfeiture of security, deposition in cash, etc. as per details given in the report. Balance payment of Rs.38,18,648/- remains to be recovered from the agency which is being pursued by the DJB. The contract has also been terminated on 04.02.2022 due to non-fulfilment of contractual obligation by the Agency. 
      In view of the above, we direct that the balance amount of Rs.38, 18,648/- may be recovered from the agency as early as possible and a compliance report may be submitted by the DJB through CVC to the Lokpal Secretariat within a period of four weeks i.e. on or before 07.04.2023.
      
7. The issue of allegations of wrongdoings by the officials of DJB and the recovery of the royalty amount from Respondent No. 7 has been noted in the said proceedings. The Lokpal has also issued directions to DJB to recover the outstanding amount from Respondent No. 7 and as stated by DJB, the appropriate proceedings stand instituted. The computation of the royalty amount was also a subject matter of scrutiny before the Lokpal and the report submitted by the CVO, DJB on this aspect has been accepted by the Lokpal.
8. The Petitioner in the present proceedings seeks to challenge the DJBs computation of the royalty amount, recovered from the erstwhile contractor in the present petition, and has set out its contra computation at para 6.16 of this petition. In our considered opinion, the alleged computation is prima facie based on surmises and is unsubstantiated from the record. The said facts and figures cannot form the basis of initiating an enquiry in the writ proceedings. The contentions at para 6.16 raises disputed questions of fact, which would require leading of evidence and even otherwise cannot be adjudicated upon in the writ petition. The prayers (I) and (VI) therefore, cannot be maintained. 
9. The Petitioner further seeks a direction to CVC i.e., Respondent No. 3 to hold an enquiry with respect to award and implementation of the erstwhile tender in favour of Respondent No. 7 during the extended period. However, as noted above, in the proceedings before the Lokpal, this issue was referred to CVC, which investigated it and reported back to the Lokpal. Therefore, prayer (IV) cannot be maintained for an action which has already been undertaken. 
10. The proceedings before the Lokpal record that Rs. 732.78 lacs towards royalty already stand recovered by DJB from the Respondent No. 7. The Lokpal directed DJB to initiate proceedings for recovery of a balance sum of Rs. 38,18,648 towards royalty. As noted above, as per the learned counsel for DJB, the civil suit has already been filed. In view thereof, the prayer (VII) does not arise for consideration.
11. As noted above, we are not persuaded that the present petition has been filed in public interest. We are not persuaded by the credentials of the Petitioner who has filed this petition. Further, in view of the fact that Lokpal, NGT and CVC have already enquired into the same issue/matter and the facts alleged in the petition have been duly considered by the said authorities, we find no material in the present petition for directing re-enquiry. In view of the aforesaid observations, we do not find any merit in the present petition and the same is dismissed along with pending applications.

Ms. Taline being his wife is incorrect. However, t his court without going 
into the same is of the opinion that the marital status of M s. Taline is of no 
importance to this court . As the court ‟s only concern should be as to whether 
a person can stand surety for the petitioner  and is a sound surety in the 
assessment of the Court.

for a period of two months from the date of his release on the following

convict. She took her daughter from the convict however, there was 
blood over her thighs.  
vii. Some person informed the police regarding the said incident. Based on 
the statement made by the victim‘s mother,  rukka  (Ex. PW -10/C) was 
sent to the police station and the FIR was registered.  
viii. After that, an investigation was conducted by police and evidences  
were collected, statements of witnesses were recorded and the 
convict /appellant i.e., Sushil Yadav was arrest ed on 22.03.2013 vide 
arrest memo Ex. PW -2/B. 
ix. On completion of the investigation, police filed the chargesheet before 
the learned Trial Court and after hearing the appellant on charge, the 
learned Trial Court framed charges against  him for the offences 
punishable under Section 366  of the  IPC and Section 5(m) of the 
POCSO Act on 15.07.2013.  
x. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial to the charges framed 
against him. During the trial to substantiate the charges framed,  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 4 of 15 
 
         
 prosecution relied on as many as 11 witnesses however, only 10 
witnesses were examined before the learned Trial Court.  
xi. After the completion of the trial, the learned Trial Court convicted the 
appellant for the offences punishable under Section 366 of IPC and 
Section  6 read with  Section  5(m) of the POCSO Act and passed an 
order on sentence against him.  
xii. Therefore, feeling aggrieved by the judgment of conviction and order 
on sentence passed by the learned Trial Court this appeal was filed by 
the appellant -convict.  
Submissions on behalf of the Appellant  
3. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the 
prosecution has not brought on record anything that could sufficiently prove 
that the child victim was kidnapped by the appellant thereby leading to 
conclusion that he  had committed the offence punishable under Section  366 
of the IPC. He further submitted that the appellant was not put any question 
during his examination under Section  313 of the Cr.P.C. as to the recovery of 
the child victim from his custody that could point out towards the complicity 
of the appellant for the commission of offence punishable under Section  366 
of the IPC.  
4. The learned counsel submitted that the impugned judgment of 
conviction passed by learned Trial Court was solely based on the medical  and 
scientific evidences led before it by the prosecution during the course of the 
trial. He further submitted that the doctors who had examined the child victim 
and the appellant during the in vestigation, were not examined  before the Trial 
Court during t he course of the trial and no explanation has been rendered  to  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 5 of 15 
 
         
 this effect by the prosecution and the same is fatal to the case of the 
prosecution as the appellant had not been provided with any opportunity to 
cross -examine them. It is pointed out that PW -1 who had been examined 
before the Trial Court is not the doctor who had examined the victim or 
prepared the MLC and he has only proved the handwriting and signature of 
the doctor who had prepared the MLCs of the appellant and child victim.  
5. Learned coun sel for the appellant further submitted that the key 
prosecution witness PW -2 had turned hostile during the course of trial and the 
material facts to prove the complicity of the appellant in the present case has 
not been proved beyond reasonable doubt befo re the Trial Court. He further 
submitted that PW -2 has resiled from the version of the incident which she 
had narrated to the police under Section  154 of the Cr.P.C. Therefore, no 
reliance can be placed on her testimony and the learned Trial Court has 
wrong ly convicted the appellant based on the testimony of PW -2.  
6.  To support the case of the appellant, learned counsel for the appellant 
has placed reliance on following case laws:  
i. Suresh v . State of Maharashtra Through Police Station Marwad, 2023 
SCC OnLin e Bom 641 (Para 8,  9 and  11) 
ii. Magan  Bihari Lai v. State of Punjab, (1977)  2 SCC  210 (Para 7)

183 (Para 17)  
v. Ram Niwas Vs. State of Har yana, 2022 SCC OnLine SC  1007 (Para

 Submissions on behalf of the State  
7. Learned APP for State submitted that PW -1, doctor who was examined 
before the Trial Court has duly proved the MLC  and also the fact that the 
thighs of the victim were stained in blood and that there was pain in her pelvic 
region . He further placed reliance on the testimony of PW -4 and submitted 
that the appellant used to reside in the house from where the victim was 
found. It is the case of the prosecution that the FSL report (Ex. PW -10/E) has 
proved presence of DNA of accused in the private parts of the victim.  
8. Learned APP for State further submitted that even though PW -2, the 
mother of the victim, has resiled  from her statement given to police and had 
not supported the case of the prosecution , she had confirmed the date and time 
of incident, the presence of the appellant on the spot of incident and the 
injuries inflicted on the private parts of the victim. He furt her submitted that 
the allegations as recorded in DD No. 69B were duly corroborated by the 
MLC as well as the FSL results tendered before the learned Trial Court. 
Moreover, it is pointed out that the presence of the appellant at the crime spot 
cannot be de nied as he had sustained injuries on person when the public gave 
beatings to him and the same is also corroborated from his MLC.  
Analysis and Findings  
9. In the impugned judgment of conviction, the learned Trial Court noted 
that evidence of the prosecution  consisted of three sets. Firstly, oral 
testimonies of PW -2 (Mother of the child victim) and PW -4 (Mr. Suresh 
Kumar); Secondly, medical evidence as given by Dr. S. Das, Dr. Shruti 
Dabral being PW -1 and PW -3 respectively; Thirdly, the statements of the 
police officials who had carried out investigation in the present case. The  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 7 of 15 
 
         
 learned Trial Court had placed reliance on the testimony of the mother of the 
child victim to prove the age of the latter and observed that as the testimony 
of PW -2 has remained unchal lenged, unrebutted and uncontroverted to this 
effect that the child victim is only 2 years of age and therefore bring the case 
under Section 5(m) of the POCSO Act.  
10. The learned Trial Court has observed that the key prosecution witness 
i.e., PW -2 who is  mother of the child victim as well as the complainant in the 
present case, has resiled from her statement recorded before the police during 
investigation and had stated a different version of the incident before the Trial 
Court during the course of trial.  The learned Trial Court has noted that 
prosecutor has tried to extract the material facts from PW -2 by cross -
examining her however, he was unsuccessful in getting the whole facts out. 
The learned Trial Court, after having assessed the credibility of the s tatement 
of PW -2 as recorded before it and the medical as well as scientific evidence 
led by the prosecution, had concluded that evidence brought on record by the 
prosecution was sufficient enough to fill the gaps which were in the testimony 
of PW -2. 
11. Therefore, the learned Trial Court had come to the conclusion that 
prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond 
reasonable doubt and had convicted him for the offences punishable under 
Section 366 IPC and Section 6 read with Section 5(m) of POCSO Act by 
observing as under: - 
 ―24. Now the testimony of the mother of the child victim has to be 
scrutinized on the above standard. Mother of the child victim deposed that 
on 13.03.2013 at about 9.00 P.M to 10.00 P.M, she was cooking meal 
inside her house and her daughter child victim aged about two years was  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 8 of 15 
 
         
 playing outside of the house in the street alongwith some other children. 
She heard noise of her daughter child victim screaming. She came outside 
of her house and saw that her daughter ch ild victim was Erying, having 
injury on her forehead and on her back part. On seeing the injuries of her 
daughter, child victim, she also started weeping. Neighbours gathered there 
and police was called on on 100 number. The Police official took her 
daught er to RTRM Hospital and she also accompanied her daughter to the 
hospital. Police obtained her signature on some blank papers and on the 
same day, her daughter child victim was discharged from RTRM Hospital. 
She had identified the accused Sushil in the cou rt.  
25. Ld. Addl. PP for the State had tried to extract the material facts from the 
mouth of the child victim's mother but he had not succeeded in getting the 
whole facts. However, the testimony of the child victim's mother has to be 
seen in the light of medical evidence as well as scientific evidence and the 
fact and the fact that the accused was apprehended at the spot. Doctor had 
found blood on both the thighs when examined. Dr. Ritika had taken the 
valval swab, cotton pad, top of baby, blood sample and  anal swab of the 
child victim. Dr. Hari Om who had also examined the accused on the same 
day had also taken the blood sample, semen sample, nail clipping, pubic 
hair and undergarment. His samples were sent to the FSL Rohini. FSL 
report Ex. PW 10/E leaves no doubt in the mind of the court about the 
credentials of the PW 2. Dr. Sarabjit Singh, Senior Scientific Officer 
(Biology), Forensic Science Laboratory, Delhi who had examined exhibits 
in the FSL found the alleles '2al' (blood sample of the accused Sushi l 
Yadav), are accounted in the alleles from the source of exhibits '1al' (Volval 
swab), ' lab' (Anal swab) & ' 1d' (cotton pad). Ld. Counsel of the accused Sh. 
V.S. Chauhan had argued that the prosecution witness had not witnessed the 
incident and as such hi s testimony should be discarded and the accused be 
given the benefit of doubt. But his arguments stand nowhere particularly in 
view of the medical and scientific evidence brought on record. Accused has 
been arrested at the spot. He was beaten by the public . He was examined 
medically and the FSL expert had concluded the alleles of the accused are 
matching with the alleles found on the source of exhibits ""1al' (Volval 
swab), 'lab' (Anal swab) & ' 1d' (cotton pad). Circumstantial evidence 
brought by the prosecu tion filled the gap coming in the testimony of the PW 
2, the mother of the child victim.‖  
 
12. The primary issue is whether the appellant is entitled to benefit of 
doubt on account of the testimony of PW -2, i.e., mother of the victim which  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 9 of 15 
 
         
 exonerates in th e present appe llant with respect to the alleged act constituting 
offence under Section 6 read with Section 5 (m) of the POCSO Act.   
13. The star witness of the prosecution was the mother of the victim ( PW-
2), who in the complaint/FIR ( Ex. PW 7/A ) had clai med to have witnessed the 
act being committed upon her daughter  by the present appellant. The 
examination -in-chief of the said witness,  as recorded before the learned Trial 
Court is as under:  
  ―On 13.03.2013, at about 9.00p.m. -10.00p.m I was cooking meal inside 
my house and my daughter child victim aged about two years was playing 
outside of the house in the street alongwith some other children. I heard 
noise of my daughter child victim screaming. I came outside of my house 
and saw that my daughter child v ictim was crying, having injury on her 
forehead and on her back part. Accused Sushil was also present there. On 
seeing the injuries of my daughter, child victim, I also started weeping. 
Thereafter lot of neighbours gathered there and they had beaten up acc used 
Sushil and someone made call on 100 number. Police reached at the spot. 
The police official took my daughter to RTRM hospital and I also 
accompanied my daughter to the hospital. Police obtained my signatures on 
some blank papers. On the same day, my d aughter child victim was 
discharged from RTRM hospital. Accused Sushil present in the court 
today(witness correctly identified). Police did not record my statement. I do 
not want to say anything else in the present case.  
At this stage, Ld.Add l.PP for stat e seeks permission to cross - examine the 
witness on the ground that witness is resiling from her previous statement.‖  
 
14. The Investigating Officer, SI Seema (PW -10), in her statement before 
the learned Trial Court, states as under:  
 ―On 14.03.2013, 1 was  posted at PS Najafgarh, On that day at around 
08:45 pm, on receipt DD No.69B I along with Ct Rajender reached at the 
spot i.e. RZ -82, Dharampura, Najafgarh. On reaching there, I came to know 
that the child victim and accused had already been taken to RTRM  hospital 
by PCR van. Thereafter, from the spot, I along with Ct Rajedner went to 
RTRM hospital where accused Sushil Yadav and child victim found 
admitted. The mother of child victim was also present in the hospital. I  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 10 of 15 
 
         
 made inquiries from mother of child v ictim and recorded her statement Ex. 
PW2/A bearing my signatures at point B. In the hospital, the doctor handed 
over me the exhibit of the child victim which was taken into possession 
vide seizure memo Ex. PW10/A bearing my signatures at point A. The 
exhib its of accused was handed over to me by the doctor after his medical 
examination on the same day which was taken into possession is Ex. 
PW10/B bearing my signatures at point A. Thereafter, I along with Ct 
Rajender, child victim, mother of child victim and accused Sushil returned 
to the police station Najafgarh. After returning to PS Najafgarh, I prepared 
rukka which is now Ex. PW10/C bearing my signatures at pont A. 
Thereafter, I handed over the rukka to duty officer for getting the case 
registered. Alter r egistration of the case, the duty officer handed over me 
copy of FIR and original rukka. Thereafter on the same day in the night, I 
along with Ct Rajender, child victim and her mother reached to the spot 
where I prepared the site plan Ex. PW10/D bearing my  signatures at point 
A. Thereafter, we returned to the spot at around 12:30 am in the night and I 
arrested accused Sushil Yadav vide arrest memo already Ex. PW2/B 
bearing my signatures at point B and his personal search was conducted 
vide memo Ex. PW2/C be aring my signatures at point B. Thereafter, 
accused was put in the lock -up and the exhibits were deposited in the 
malkhana.  
On the next day i.e. 15.03.2013, accused was produced before the court and 
he was sent to JC.  
On 22.03.2013, the exhibits were sen t to FSL, Rohini through Ct Satish. I 
recorded the statement of witnesses and prepared the challan and fled in the 
court. Accused Sushil Yadav is present in the court today (witness correctly 
identified the accused).‖  
 
15. At this stage , the timeline of th e investigation of the present case 
including the collection of sample till their examination  in the FSL becomes 
relevant : 
i. The MLC  of the victim  (Ex. PW -1/A) dated  14.03.2013 at 9:15  PM 
records that  ― no marks of injury all over body, L/E both thighs are 
stained with blood but no active bleeding at the time of exam ination , 
slight blood tinged  discharge seen coming through os, hymen intact,  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 11 of 15 
 
         
 small 1 -2 mm tear over vulva present ’. The MLC further records  that 
samples were taken and sealed and handed over to th e Investigating 
Officer . The samples includ ed vulval swab, cotton pad, top of baby 
(grey coloured), blood sample and anal swab.  The said samples were  
seized by the Investigating Officer vide seizure memo dated 
14.03.2013.  
ii. The accused was examined on the s ame date , at about 10:30  PM vide 
MLC (Ex. PW -1/B). The MLC recorded that the present appellant had 
three clear lacerated wound s – ‗2x2 cm parietooccipital region; 3x1 cm 
frontal region (Rt.); 2x1 cm (Rt frontal  region)’. The said MLC further 
records that b lood sample, semen sample, nail clipping, pubic hair and 
undergarment of the appellant were  hand ed over to the Investigating 
Officer.  The same was seized by the Investigating Officer vide seizure 
memo (Ex. PW -10/B).  The MLC also records that the appellant  was 
brought by the police with history of committing sexual assault and 
being beaten  by the public present at the spot.  
iii. The samples of the victim as well as the appellant  were deposited in the 
concerned malkhana  reflected in the entry Ex. PW -6/A on 14.03.2 013 
itself.  
iv. As per the records , the said samples were sent for  examination to the  
FSL on 22.03.2013,  which was received by the FSL on the same day 
vide Ex. PW -6/C.  
v. Finally the FSL report (Ex. PW -10/E) gives the following opinion:  
―RESULTS OF DNA ANALYSIS  
DNA profile of female origin has been generated from the source of 
exhibits  1cl (Blood sample of victim) and 2e' (Underwear of accused).  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 12 of 15 
 
         
 Also female DNA profile has been generated from the exhibit. However, 
male DNA profile has been generate d from the so urce of exhibits '1 al' 
(Vulv al swab), '1a2' (Anal swab) & '1 d' (Cotton pad). Allele from the 
source of exhibits '2al' (Blood sample of accused Sushil Yadav), are 
accounted in the allele s from the source of exhibits '1 al' (Vulv al swab), '1a2' 
(Anal swab) & '1d' (Cotton pad).  
CONCLUSION  
DNA profiling (STR analysis) performed on the exhibits ' 1al' (Vulval 
swab), '1 a2' (Anal swab), ' 1cl' (Blood sample of victim), ' 1d' (Cotton pad), 
'2al' (Blood sample of accused) & 2e' (Underwear of accused) are sufficient 
to conclude that:  
1.DNA profile of male origin has been generated from the source of 
exhibits '2al' (Blood sample of a ccuse d Sushil Yadav) is matching with the 
DNA profile generated from the source of exhibits Vulval swab), ' 1a2' 
(Anal swab), '1 d' (Cotton pa d) of victim **** .  
2. Female DNA profile has been generated from the source of exhibits '2e' 
(Underwear of accused) is matching with the DNA profile generated from 
the source of exhibit ' 1cl‘ (Blood sample of victim ***** ).‖ 
 
(name of the child victim has  been redacted to protect her identity)  
 
16. From the aforesaid record , it is pertinent to note that the child victim 
was examined , as has been stated by her mother (PW-2). Though the said 
witness  does not support the case of the prosecution with respect to the 
ingredients of Section 3 of the POCSO Act (penetrative sexual assault), 
however, the observations in the MLC of the victim and the findings of the 
FSL demonstrate otherwise. It is pertinent to note that though the mother of 
the victim (PW -2) admits t hat her daughter was injured but she does not give 
any details about the nature or the cause of such injuries.  
17. The MLC clearly records small 1 -2 mm tear over vulva and also 
records slight blood  tinged discharge coming from the 'os', i.e., the vaginal 
opening.  Similarly the MLC of the accused showing the external injuries at 
his body also corroborates the case of the prosecution with regard to the  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 13 of 15 
 
         
 beating being given to him by the public while he was apprehended. The 
aforesaid observation of the MLC coup led with the FSL report that show the 
presence of the DNA of the accused on the victim brings the case of the 
prosecution within the meaning of Section 3 of the POCSO Act, which 
defines penetrative sexual assault, as under: - 
―3. Penetrative sexual assault. —A person is said to commit ―penetrative 
sexual assault‖ if —  
 (a) he penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra 
or anus of a child or makes the child to do so with him or any other person; 
or  
 (b) he inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the 
penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of the child or makes the child to 
do so with him or any other person; or  
 (c) he manipulates any part of the body of the child so as to cause 
penetration into the vag ina, urethra, anus or any part of body of the child or 
makes the child to do so with him or any other person; or  
 (d) he applies his mouth to the penis, vagina, anus, urethra of the child or 
makes the child to do so to such person or any other person.  
 
 Since the victim was less than 12 years of age, t he appellant has been 
convicted for committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault, defined in 
Section 5(m) of the POCSO Act as under:  
""5. Aggravated penetrative sexual assault. — 
***     ***     *** 
(m) who ever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve 
years; ..."" 
 
18. The link evidence, i.e, the chain from the time the samples were seized 
till it is deposited with FSL is complete in all respects. The samples were 
deposited on the day it was seized, i.e., 14.03.2013 and was sent to the FSL 
within 8 days, i.e., 22.03.2013. The presence of DNA  of the appellant  on  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 14 of 15 
 
         
 vulval and anal swab of the victim brings the case of the prosecution under 
Section s 3 read with 5(m)  of the POCSO Act.  
19. The Hon‘b le Supreme Court , in Abdul  Sayeed v. State of Madhya 
Pradesh, (2010 ) 10 SCC 259 , while appreciating variance between medical 
and ocular evidence has held as under:  
―34. Drawing on  Bhagirath case  [(1999) 5 SCC 96 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 
658] , this Court has held that where the medical evidence is at variance 
with ocular evidence,  
―it has to be noted that it would be erroneous to accord undue 
primacy to the hypothetical answers of medical witnesses to 
exclude the eyewitnesses' account which had to be tested 
indepen dently and not treated as the ‗variable‘ keeping the 
medical evidence as the ‗constant‘ ‖.  
35. Where the eyewitnesses' account is found credible and 
trustworthy, a medical opinion pointing to alternative possibilities cannot 
be accepted as conclusive. The eyewitnesses' account requires a careful 
independent assessment and evaluation for its credibility, which should 
not be adversely prejudged on the basis of any other evidence, including 
medical evidence, as the sole touchstone for the test of such credibil ity. 
―21. … The evidence must be tested for its inherent 
consistency and the inherent probability of the story; 
consistency with the account of other witnesses held to be 
creditworthy; consistency with the undisputed facts, the ‗credit‘ 
of the witnesses; t heir performance in the witness box; their 
power of observation, etc. Then the probative value of such 
evidence becomes eligible to be put into the scales for a 
cumulative evaluation.‖  
[Vide  Thaman Kumar  v. State  (UT of Chandigarh ) [(2003) 6 SCC 380 : 
2003  SCC (Cri) 1362] and  Krishnan  v. State  [(2003) 7 SCC 56 : 2003 
SCC (Cri) 1577] at SCC pp. 62 -63, para 21.]  
 
***     ***             *** 
39. Thus, the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction 
between medical evidence and ocular evidence can b e crystallised to the 
effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater  
CRL.A. 830/2017                                        Page 15 of 15 
 
         
 evidentiary value vis -à-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence 
makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in 
the process of the evaluatio n of evidence. However, where the medical 
evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the 
ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.‖  
 
 
20. In the present case the medical and other scientific evidence whic h has 
come on record completely rules out the testimony of PW -2 (mother of the 
victim) to the extent that the act was not committed by the present appellant.  
21. This Court is of the considered view that the prosecution has been able 
to prove the guilt of  the present appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The 
medical and scientific evidence brought on record by the prosecution is credit 
worthy and unimpeachable. The conviction of the appellant can therefore be 
sustained on the said evidence in spite of the abs ence of eye -witness account. 
22. As far as the order on sentence is concerned, this Court is of the 
considered opinion that the learned Trial Court has  duly considered the 
mitigating circumstances pl eaded on behalf of the appellant at the time of 
sentencing.  In view thereof,  the order on sentence is also sustained.  
23. The appeal is dismissed and disposed of accordingly.  
24. Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of.  
25. Judgment be uplo aded on the website of this Court, forthwith .  
26. Copy of the judgment be sent to the concerned jail superintendent for 
necessary information and compliance.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant
3.	Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that the prosecution has not brought on record anything that could sufficiently prove that the child victim was kidnapped by the appellant thereby leading to conclusion that he had committed the offence punishable under Section 366 of the IPC. He further submitted that the appellant was not put any question during his examination under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. as to the recovery of the child victim from his custody that could point out towards the complicity of the appellant for the commission of offence punishable under Section 366 of the IPC.
4.	The learned counsel submitted that the impugned judgment of conviction passed by learned Trial Court was solely based on the medical and scientific evidences led before it by the prosecution during the course of the trial. He further submitted that the doctors who had examined the child victim and the appellant during the investigation, were not examined before the Trial Court during the course of the trial and no explanation has been rendered to this effect by the prosecution and the same is fatal to the case of the prosecution as the appellant had not been provided with any opportunity to cross-examine them. It is pointed out that PW-1 who had been examined before the Trial Court is not the doctor who had examined the victim or prepared the MLC and he has only proved the handwriting and signature of the doctor who had prepared the MLCs of the appellant and child victim.
5.	Learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the key prosecution witness PW-2 had turned hostile during the course of trial and the material facts to prove the complicity of the appellant in the present case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt before the Trial Court. He further submitted that PW-2 has resiled from the version of the incident which she had narrated to the police under Section 154 of the Cr.P.C. Therefore, no reliance can be placed on her testimony and the learned Trial Court has wrongly convicted the appellant based on the testimony of PW-2. 
6. 	To support the case of the appellant, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on following case laws:
i. Suresh v. State of Maharashtra Through Police Station Marwad, 2023 SCC OnLine Bom 641 (Para 8, 9 and 11)
ii. Magan Bihari Lai v. State of Punjab, (1977) 2 SCC 210 (Para 7)
iii. Shambu Nath Mehra v. State of Ajmer, 1956 SCR 199 (para 9)
iv. Satye Singh and Anr. v. State of Uttarakhand, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 183 (Para 17)
v. Ram Niwas Vs. State of Haryana, 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1007 (Para 20)
vi. Vikramjit Singh Vs. State of Punjab, (2006) 12 SCC 306 (Para 27)
Submissions on behalf of the State
7.	Learned APP for State submitted that PW-1, doctor who was examined before the Trial Court has duly proved the MLC and also the fact that the thighs of the victim were stained in blood and that there was pain in her pelvic region. He further placed reliance on the testimony of PW-4 and submitted that the appellant used to reside in the house from where the victim was found. It is the case of the prosecution that the FSL report (Ex. PW-10/E) has proved presence of DNA of accused in the private parts of the victim.
8.	Learned APP for State further submitted that even though PW-2, the mother of the victim, has resiled from her statement given to police and had not supported the case of the prosecution, she had confirmed the date and time of incident, the presence of the appellant on the spot of incident and the injuries inflicted on the private parts of the victim. He further submitted that the allegations as recorded in DD No. 69B were duly corroborated by the MLC as well as the FSL results tendered before the learned Trial Court. Moreover, it is pointed out that the presence of the appellant at the crime spot cannot be denied as he had sustained injuries on person when the public gave beatings to him and the same is also corroborated from his MLC.
Analysis and Findings
9.	In the impugned judgment of conviction, the learned Trial Court noted that evidence of the prosecution consisted of three sets. Firstly, oral testimonies of PW-2 (Mother of the child victim) and PW-4 (Mr. Suresh Kumar); Secondly, medical evidence as given by Dr. S. Das, Dr. Shruti Dabral being PW-1 and PW-3 respectively; Thirdly, the statements of the police officials who had carried out investigation in the present case. The learned Trial Court had placed reliance on the testimony of the mother of the child victim to prove the age of the latter and observed that as the testimony of PW-2 has remained unchallenged, unrebutted and uncontroverted to this effect that the child victim is only 2 years of age and therefore bring the case under Section 5(m) of the POCSO Act. 
10.	The learned Trial Court has observed that the key prosecution witness i.e., PW-2 who is mother of the child victim as well as the complainant in the present case, has resiled from her statement recorded before the police during investigation and had stated a different version of the incident before the Trial Court during the course of trial. The learned Trial Court has noted that prosecutor has tried to extract the material facts from PW-2 by cross-examining her however, he was unsuccessful in getting the whole facts out. The learned Trial Court, after having assessed the credibility of the statement of PW-2 as recorded before it and the medical as well as scientific evidence led by the prosecution, had concluded that evidence brought on record by the prosecution was sufficient enough to fill the gaps which were in the testimony of PW-2.
11.	Therefore, the learned Trial Court had come to the conclusion that prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and had convicted him for the offences punishable under Section 366 IPC and Section 6 read with Section 5(m) of POCSO Act by observing as under:-
 24. Now the testimony of the mother of the child victim has to be scrutinized on the above standard. Mother of the child victim deposed that on 13.03.2013 at about 9.00 P.M to 10.00 P.M, she was cooking meal inside her house and her daughter child victim aged about two years was playing outside of the house in the street alongwith some other children. She heard noise of her daughter child victim screaming. She came outside of her house and saw that her daughter child victim was Erying, having injury on her forehead and on her back part. On seeing the injuries of her daughter, child victim, she also started weeping. Neighbours gathered there and police was called on on 100 number. The Police official took her daughter to RTRM Hospital and she also accompanied her daughter to the hospital. Police obtained her signature on some blank papers and on the same day, her daughter child victim was discharged from RTRM Hospital. She had identified the accused Sushil in the court. 
25. Ld. Addl. PP for the State had tried to extract the material facts from the mouth of the child victim's mother but he had not succeeded in getting the whole facts. However, the testimony of the child victim's mother has to be seen in the light of medical evidence as well as scientific evidence and the fact and the fact that the accused was apprehended at the spot. Doctor had found blood on both the thighs when examined. Dr. Ritika had taken the valval swab, cotton pad, top of baby, blood sample and anal swab of the child victim. Dr. Hari Om who had also examined the accused on the same day had also taken the blood sample, semen sample, nail clipping, pubic hair and undergarment. His samples were sent to the FSL Rohini. FSL report Ex. PW 10/E leaves no doubt in the mind of the court about the credentials of the PW 2. Dr. Sarabjit Singh, Senior Scientific Officer (Biology), Forensic Science Laboratory, Delhi who had examined exhibits in the FSL found the alleles '2al' (blood sample of the accused Sushil Yadav), are accounted in the alleles from the source of exhibits '1al' (Volval swab), 'lab' (Anal swab) & '1d' (cotton pad). Ld. Counsel of the accused Sh. V.S. Chauhan had argued that the prosecution witness had not witnessed the incident and as such his testimony should be discarded and the accused be given the benefit of doubt. But his arguments stand nowhere particularly in view of the medical and scientific evidence brought on record. Accused has been arrested at the spot. He was beaten by the public. He was examined medically and the FSL expert had concluded the alleles of the accused are matching with the alleles found on the source of exhibits ""1al' (Volval swab), 'lab' (Anal swab) & '1d' (cotton pad). Circumstantial evidence brought by the prosecution filled the gap coming in the testimony of the PW 2, the mother of the child victim.

12.	The primary issue is whether the appellant is entitled to benefit of doubt on account of the testimony of PW-2, i.e., mother of the victim which exonerates in the present appellant with respect to the alleged act constituting offence under Section 6 read with Section 5 (m) of the POCSO Act.  
13.	The star witness of the prosecution was the mother of the victim (PW-2), who in the complaint/FIR (Ex. PW 7/A) had claimed to have witnessed the act being committed upon her daughter by the present appellant. The examination-in-chief of the said witness, as recorded before the learned Trial Court is as under:
 	On 13.03.2013, at about 9.00p.m.-10.00p.m I was cooking meal inside my house and my daughter child victim aged about two years was playing outside of the house in the street alongwith some other children. I heard noise of my daughter child victim screaming. I came outside of my house and saw that my daughter child victim was crying, having injury on her forehead and on her back part. Accused Sushil was also present there. On seeing the injuries of my daughter, child victim, I also started weeping. Thereafter lot of neighbours gathered there and they had beaten up accused Sushil and someone made call on 100 number. Police reached at the spot. The police official took my daughter to RTRM hospital and I also accompanied my daughter to the hospital. Police obtained my signatures on some blank papers. On the same day, my daughter child victim was discharged from RTRM hospital. Accused Sushil present in the court today(witness correctly identified). Police did not record my statement. I do not want to say anything else in the present case. 
 At this stage, Ld.Addl.PP for state seeks permission to cross- examine the witness on the ground that witness is resiling from her previous statement.

14.	The Investigating Officer, SI Seema (PW-10), in her statement before the learned Trial Court, states as under:
 On 14.03.2013, 1 was posted at PS Najafgarh, On that day at around 08:45 pm, on receipt DD No.69B I along with Ct Rajender reached at the spot i.e. RZ-82, Dharampura, Najafgarh. On reaching there, I came to know that the child victim and accused had already been taken to RTRM hospital by PCR van. Thereafter, from the spot, I along with Ct Rajedner went to RTRM hospital where accused Sushil Yadav and child victim found admitted. The mother of child victim was also present in the hospital. I made inquiries from mother of child victim and recorded her statement Ex. PW2/A bearing my signatures at point B. In the hospital, the doctor handed over me the exhibit of the child victim which was taken into possession vide seizure memo Ex. PW10/A bearing my signatures at point A. The exhibits of accused was handed over to me by the doctor after his medical examination on the same day which was taken into possession is Ex. PW10/B bearing my signatures at point A. Thereafter, I along with Ct Rajender, child victim, mother of child victim and accused Sushil returned to the police station Najafgarh. After returning to PS Najafgarh, I prepared rukka which is now Ex. PW10/C bearing my signatures at pont A. Thereafter, I handed over the rukka to duty officer for getting the case registered. Alter registration of the case, the duty officer handed over me copy of FIR and original rukka. Thereafter on the same day in the night, I along with Ct Rajender, child victim and her mother reached to the spot where I prepared the site plan Ex. PW10/D bearing my signatures at point A. Thereafter, we returned to the spot at around 12:30 am in the night and I arrested accused Sushil Yadav vide arrest memo already Ex. PW2/B bearing my signatures at point B and his personal search was conducted vide memo Ex. PW2/C bearing my signatures at point B. Thereafter, accused was put in the lock-up and the exhibits were deposited in the malkhana. 
On the next day i.e. 15.03.2013, accused was produced before the court and he was sent to JC. 
On 22.03.2013, the exhibits were sent to FSL, Rohini through Ct Satish. I recorded the statement of witnesses and prepared the challan and fled in the court. Accused Sushil Yadav is present in the court today (witness correctly identified the accused).

15.	At this stage, the timeline of the investigation of the present case including the collection of sample till their examination in the FSL becomes relevant:
i. The MLC of the victim (Ex. PW-1/A) dated 14.03.2013 at 9:15 PM records that  no marks of injury all over body, L/E both thighs are stained with blood but no active bleeding at the time of examination, slight blood tinged discharge seen coming through os, hymen intact, small 1-2 mm tear over vulva present. The MLC further records that samples were taken and sealed and handed over to the Investigating Officer. The samples included vulval swab, cotton pad, top of baby (grey coloured), blood sample and anal swab. The said samples were seized by the Investigating Officer vide seizure memo dated 14.03.2013. 
ii. The accused was examined on the same date, at about 10:30 PM vide MLC (Ex. PW-1/B). The MLC recorded that the present appellant had three clear lacerated wounds  2x2 cm parietooccipital region; 3x1 cm frontal region (Rt.); 2x1 cm (Rt frontal region). The said MLC further records that blood sample, semen sample, nail clipping, pubic hair and undergarment of the appellant were handed over to the Investigating Officer. The same was seized by the Investigating Officer vide seizure memo (Ex. PW-10/B). The MLC also records that the appellant was brought by the police with history of committing sexual assault and being beaten by the public present at the spot.
iii. The samples of the victim as well as the appellant were deposited in the concerned malkhana reflected in the entry Ex. PW-6/A on 14.03.2013 itself. 
iv. As per the records, the said samples were sent for examination to the FSL on 22.03.2013, which was received by the FSL on the same day vide Ex. PW-6/C. 
v. Finally the FSL report (Ex. PW-10/E) gives the following opinion:
RESULTS OF DNA ANALYSIS
DNA profile of female origin has been generated from the source of exhibits  1cl (Blood sample of victim) and 2e' (Underwear of accused). Also female DNA profile has been generated from the exhibit. However, male DNA profile has been generated from the source of exhibits '1al' (Vulval swab), '1a2' (Anal swab) & '1d' (Cotton pad). Allele from the source of exhibits '2al' (Blood sample of accused Sushil Yadav), are accounted in the alleles from the source of exhibits '1al' (Vulval swab), '1a2' (Anal swab) & '1d' (Cotton pad). 
CONCLUSION
DNA profiling (STR analysis) performed on the exhibits '1al' (Vulval swab), '1a2' (Anal swab), '1cl' (Blood sample of victim), '1d' (Cotton pad), '2al' (Blood sample of accused) & 2e' (Underwear of accused) are sufficient to conclude that: 
1.DNA profile of male origin has been generated from the source of exhibits '2al' (Blood sample of accused Sushil Yadav) is matching with the DNA profile generated from the source of exhibits Vulval swab), '1a2' (Anal swab), '1d' (Cotton pad) of victim ****. 
2. Female DNA profile has been generated from the source of exhibits '2e' (Underwear of accused) is matching with the DNA profile generated from the source of exhibit '1cl (Blood sample of victim *****).

(name of the child victim has been redacted to protect her identity)

16.	From the aforesaid record, it is pertinent to note that the child victim was examined, as has been stated by her mother (PW-2). Though the said witness does not support the case of the prosecution with respect to the ingredients of Section 3 of the POCSO Act (penetrative sexual assault), however, the observations in the MLC of the victim and the findings of the FSL demonstrate otherwise. It is pertinent to note that though the mother of the victim (PW-2) admits that her daughter was injured but she does not give any details about the nature or the cause of such injuries.
17.	The MLC clearly records small 1-2 mm tear over vulva and also records slight blood tinged discharge coming from the 'os', i.e., the vaginal opening. Similarly the MLC of the accused showing the external injuries at his body also corroborates the case of the prosecution with regard to the beating being given to him by the public while he was apprehended. The aforesaid observation of the MLC coupled with the FSL report that show the presence of the DNA of the accused on the victim brings the case of the prosecution within the meaning of Section 3 of the POCSO Act, which defines penetrative sexual assault, as under:-
3. Penetrative sexual assault.A person is said to commit penetrative sexual assault if 
	(a) he penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a child or makes the child to do so with him or any other person; or 
	(b) he inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of the child or makes the child to do so with him or any other person; or 
	(c) he manipulates any part of the body of the child so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of the child or makes the child to do so with him or any other person; or 
	(d) he applies his mouth to the penis, vagina, anus, urethra of the child or makes the child to do so to such person or any other person.

	Since the victim was less than 12 years of age, the appellant has been convicted for committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault, defined in Section 5(m) of the POCSO Act as under:
""5. Aggravated penetrative sexual assault.
***					***					***
(m) whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve years;...""

18.	The link evidence, i.e, the chain from the time the samples were seized till it is deposited with FSL is complete in all respects. The samples were deposited on the day it was seized, i.e., 14.03.2013 and was sent to the FSL within 8 days, i.e., 22.03.2013. The presence of DNA of the appellant on vulval and anal swab of the victim brings the case of the prosecution under Sections 3 read with 5(m) of the POCSO Act. 
19.	The Honble Supreme Court, in Abdul Sayeed v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2010) 10 SCC 259, while appreciating variance between medical and ocular evidence has held as under:
   34. Drawing on Bhagirath case [(1999) 5 SCC 96 : 1999 SCC (Cri) 658] , this Court has held that where the medical evidence is at variance with ocular evidence,
it has to be noted that it would be erroneous to accord undue primacy to the hypothetical answers of medical witnesses to exclude the eyewitnesses' account which had to be tested independently and not treated as the variable keeping the medical evidence as the constant .
   35. Where the eyewitnesses' account is found credible and trustworthy, a medical opinion pointing to alternative possibilities cannot be accepted as conclusive. The eyewitnesses' account requires a careful independent assessment and evaluation for its credibility, which should not be adversely prejudged on the basis of any other evidence, including medical evidence, as the sole touchstone for the test of such credibility.
   21.  The evidence must be tested for its inherent consistency and the inherent probability of the story; consistency with the account of other witnesses held to be creditworthy; consistency with the undisputed facts, the credit of the witnesses; their performance in the witness box; their power of observation, etc. Then the probative value of such evidence becomes eligible to be put into the scales for a cumulative evaluation.
[Vide Thaman Kumar v. State (UT of Chandigarh) [(2003) 6 SCC 380 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1362] and Krishnan v. State [(2003) 7 SCC 56 : 2003 SCC (Cri) 1577] at SCC pp. 62-63, para 21.]

***					***				         ***
   39. Thus, the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction between medical evidence and ocular evidence can be crystallised to the effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the process of the evaluation of evidence. However, where the medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.


20.	In the present case the medical and other scientific evidence which has come on record completely rules out the testimony of PW-2 (mother of the victim) to the extent that the act was not committed by the present appellant. 
21.	This Court is of the considered view that the prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the present appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The medical and scientific evidence brought on record by the prosecution is credit worthy and unimpeachable. The conviction of the appellant can therefore be sustained on the said evidence in spite of the absence of eye-witness account. 22.	As far as the order on sentence is concerned, this Court is of the considered opinion that the learned Trial Court has duly considered the mitigating circumstances pleaded on behalf of the appellant at the time of sentencing. In view thereof, the order on sentence is also sustained. 
23.	The appeal is dismissed and disposed of accordingly. 
24.	Pending applications, if any, also stand disposed of. 
25.	Judgment be uploaded on the website of this Court, forthwith. 
26.	Copy of the judgment be sent to the concerned jail superintendent for necessary information and compliance.

trust dated 05th November, 2000 in name of “ CINNI Foundation ”).  
5. Dipak Kumar S ah relies on clause 5.5 (a) of the deed of trust which 
states as under:  
“That Sri Chandra Kumar Sah shall be the first Managing Trustee 
and he shall continue to be the Managing Trustee for his lifetime. 
He shall be empowered to nominate any person as his successor to 
work as Managing Trustee after his lifetime.”  
6. Dipak Kumar S ah claims that Chandra Kumar Sah (his father) 
executed a deed dated 25th September  2012 , stating inter alia  that basis  
the right to appoint successor Managing Trustee, he was exercising  his

rights to appoint Dipak Kumar S ah, his son, as lifetime Managing 
Trustee of CINNI Foundation.   
7. On this basis, Dipak Kumar S ah claims to be Managing Trustee of 
CINNI Foundation and therefore “ person aggrieved ” in respect of the 
registration of the impugned artwork by  inter alia respondent no.1  and 
Late Shri Ravindra Kumar Sah  (the other copyright applicant  for the 
registration who has since passed away in 2019 ).  
Submissions on behalf of the petitioner  
8. Objections taken by petitioner’s counsel in relation to the impugned 
work are as under:  
8.1.  This impugned artwork was the exact replica of the device mark for 
‘CINNI ’ registered by No. 383591  on 27th November  1981  by the 
partnership , Raj Kumar Sah and Sons (having  partners Raj Kumar 
Sah, Rajendra Kumar Sah and Ravindra Kumar Sah) , with their 
offices in Varanasi (UP). The registered trademark as it appeared in 
trademark journal in class 11 appended by the petitioner is as under:  
 
                                                                                                         
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                4 of  13  
 
 
 
8.2.  According to the petitioner, the said trademark  was assigned by the 
partnership vide assignment deed dated 05th November, 2000, which 
was appended with the petition. Basis the deed of assignment, the 
partners of M/s Raj Kumar Sah and Sons assigned the registered 
trademark ‘CINNI ’ along with other Intellectual Property to CINNI 
Foundation through its Managing Trustee Sh. Chandra Kumar Sah. 
It was thus claimed that CINNI Foundation acting through Managing 
Trustee (which  Dipak Kumar Sah said he was) was the owner of the 
registered device mark ‘CINNI ’.  
8.3.  Being owner of the registered mark since 1981, the copyright in the 
artwork which was part  of the trademark  could not have been applied 
for in 2016 by  Ravindra Kumar Sah and Anjan Nara yan Singh (who  
according to Dipak Kumar Sah are wrongly masquerading as 
Managing Trustees of CINNI Foundation). Not only was the 
impugned artwork, an integral part of the registered trademark but also 
                                                                                                         
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                5 of  13  
 
authorship  of the artwork  could not be claimed by the  copyright  
applicants therein.  
8.4.  Serial no. 9 of the statement of particular s of the impugned 
registration shows 1964 as the year of the first publication. Counsel 
for petitioner drew attention to the fact that respondent no.1 ( Anjan 
Nara yan Singh ) as per his affidavit March  2022 claimed to be 51 years 
on that day  and would be therefore born in 1971 . Therefore,  his claim 
for authorship of the said mark in 1964 cannot  arise and  is impossible 
to accept. Since, the application was jointly filed by respondent no.1 
and Ravindra Kumar Sah, it w as clearly a fraud played out on the 
Registrar of Copyright by claiming authorship of both the copyright 
applicants since 1964.   
8.5.  Petitioner’s counsel contended that not only was fraud played out 
upon the Registrar of Copyright , but also the Registrar was amiss  in 
not complying with statutory obligation under the Act :  firstly , Section 
45 (1) of the Act mandated that in respect of an artistic work capable 
of being used in relation to goods and services, the application should 
be accompanied by a certificate from the Registrar of Trademarks , to 
the effect that no trademark identical with or deceptively similar to 
such artistic work ha d been registered under the Trademark A ct. Such 
a certificate ha d indeed been provided, however, it did not disclose the 
registration of the ‘CINNI ’ trademark of 1981 (and other similar 
marks of ‘CINNI ’ registered at various other points of time ); secondly , 
as per Rule 70(9) mandate of the Copyright Rules 2013  (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Rules ”) the person applying for registration was 
mandated to give notice of his application to every person who claims                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                6 of  13  
 
or has interest in the subject matter of the copyright or disputes the 
applicants rights; thirdly , as per Rules 70 (10) and 70 (11) the 
Registrar of Copyright was obliged to be satisfied about the 
correctness of the particulars given in the copyright application and 
was to hold an inquiry as deemed fit before endorsing a registration of 
a copyright. Petitioner’s counsel stated that no such exercise was done, 
there was no application of mind and no inquiry was ever held, which 
would itself make the registrat ion invalid.   
8.6.  It was argued that the phrase ‘person aggrieved ’ under Section 50 of 
the Act had to be liberally constituted  including those persons against 
whom such copyright was being forced.  In the circumstances  that an 
FIR had been registered by respondent no.1 against Dipak Kumar Sah 
in respect of the infringement  of copyright, Dip ak Kumar Sah would 
end up being a “person aggrieved ”, as also the Foundation that he 
claims to be the Managing Trustee of. 
8.7.  Petitioner’s counsel asserted , quite categorically , that even if there 
were disputes between the parties relating to the trusteeship (through 
civil suits filed in Varanasi  and multifarious  litigations ), it could not 
take away from the fact  that the impugned artwork could not exist or 
continue on the Regist er of Copyright, due process having not been 
followed as contended above.   
8.8.  Rights in rem could not have been created as asserted by respondent 
no.1 in respect of the impugned artwork, the rights to which they did 
not own in law.  
                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                7 of  13  
 
Submissions on behalf of respondent no.1  
9. In response counsel for respondent no. 1 laboured on certain facts to 
assert the position that an application for registration of the mark was 
made on behalf of CINNI Foundation of which Ravindra Kumar Sa h 
and respondent no.1 were the Managing Trustees in 2016 (when  the 
application was made ). 
10. Counsel for respondent no.1 categorically stated at the outset  that 
Anjan Nara yan Singh ( respondent no.1)  or anyone else acting on his 
behalf was not claiming copyright registration in his individual name  
and acknowledge d that it was in the name of the Foundation /Trust . 
11.  Submissions in this regard were inter alia  as under:  
11.1.  Most importantly, he stated t hat petitioners had suppressed the 
execution of the deed for amendment of the CINNI Foundation Trust, 
dated 30th December 2009. This deed, which was appended by 
respondent No. 1, bears out that it was executed by Ravindra Kumar 
Sah in the capacity of the settl or of the Trust (the co -settler late Raj 
Kumar Sah, father of Ravindra Kumar Sah, having passed away ). Re-
constitution of Board of Trustees was necessitated, as per 
circumstances stated in the deed of amendment.  
11.2. In terms of clause 13 of the said deed, the new trustees of the Trust 
were d elineated as Ravindra Kumar Sah as Trustee and Chairman, 
Anjan Nara yan Singh as M anaging Trustee, Sumit Ag rawal and Smi ta 
Singh  as Trustees. It was pursuant to this amen dment, that Ravindra 
Kumar Sah and Anjan  Nara yan Singh, as Chairman and Managing                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                8 of  13  
 
Trustee of CINNI  Foundation, had filed an application for registration 
of copyright in 2016.  
11.3. While admit ting that Chandra  Kumar Sah was the Trustee, in the 
original Trust Deed, it was stated that  pursuant to the said amendment, 
he did no t have any right to nominate Dipak Kumar Sah  in 2012 as 
claimed by petitioner.  
11.4. The amendment was challenged by Chandra Kumar Sah, and the 
suit filed in 2012 was still pending in District Court Varanasi, and no 
interim relief had been granted. Therefore, the clai m of Dipak Kumar 
Sah to be the Managing Trustee of CINNI Foundation was untenable 
and the petitioner’s  locus was therefore questioned on that account. 
Both , in terms of legal status , as well as being “ person aggrieved ” 
under  Section 50 of the Act.  Notably,  facts relating to the  pending  
litigation  proceedings,  and there being no interim relief in favour of 
Dipak Kumar Sah , were  not refuted b y petitioner’s counsel.  
11.5. Counsel for respondent no. 1 pointed out the m inutes of meeting 
dated 16th January, 2022 of the Trustees of CINNI Foundation which 
was attended by Smita  Singh, Anjan Nara yan Singh and Anvi Singh 
as Trustees, taking note of this mater being filed by Dipak Kumar Sah 
and authorising Anjan Narayan  Singh to  take all necessary action on 
behalf of the Trust.  
11.6. The claim of Dipak Kumar Sah to be authorised by CINNI 
Foundation Trust was questioned on the basis that no resolution or 
authority had also been filed noting the endorsement by other trustees. 
Respondent ’s counsel submitted that he was a n interloper who could                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                9 of  13  
 
not assert a right on the basis of unilateral nomination by his late father 
to the post of Managing Trustee.  
11.7. It was pointed out that on 22nd April  2009, due to the anti-trust 
activity of Chandra Kumar Sah, the other trustees , including his elder 
son Suraj Kumar Sah , passed a resolution by majority voting and 
removed Chandra Kumar Sah from the post of Managing Trustee. 
This was challenged by Chandra Kumar Sah by multiple legal 
proceedings, details of which may not be necessary and relevant.  
11.8. Respondent no’s 1 counsel pointed out that the subsequent 
development of the 2009 t rust deed amendment was allowed to 
brought  on record in 2010 , in proceedings before the Delhi High 
Court.  Also,  an order dated 01st March, 2013, was passed by this Court 
noting that , Chandra Kumar Sah was no longer in the management of 
the Trust, and the Trust itself did not want to pursue the suit . 
Therefore, the suit was  not proceeded ahead with and the matter was 
subject to the challenge of the amendment.  
Analysis  
12.  Having heard counsel for parties and on an assessment of the 
documents on record and submissions filed , the following appears to 
this Court as relevant :  
12.1. Aside from the heavily disputed issue of who is  the Managing Trustee 
of the CINNI Foundation, certain basic facts have been clearly 
admitted by the counsel : firstly , that CINNI Foundation is a registered 
trust having been originally settled by Raj Kumar Sah and his son 
Ravindra Kumar Sah on 5th  November, 2000;  secondly , Chandra                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                10 of  13  
 
Kumar Sah and Ravindra Kumar Sah were both amongst the first 
trustees of the said Trust; thirdly , that the registration of the trademark 
‘CINNI ’ was in favour of the CINNI Foundation in 1981; fourthly , 
that the registration of the impugned artwork as a copyright was also 
made on behalf of the CINNI Foundation ( albeit  by respondent no. 1 
and Ravindra Kumar Sah, basis a claim that they were the new  
Chairman and Managing Trustee ). It is therefore quite evident that no 
particular individual , in their own right , is claiming the impugned 
artwork and copyright therein.  
12.2. Needless to say, since Ravindra Kumar Sah has passed away, the other 
applicant for copyright i.e. respondent no.1  (who is a party in this 
proceeding ) will be bound by this statement and undertaking. It is 
established that the impugned artwork /copyright  was therefore 
claimed only by the CINNI Foundation /Trust, and therefore will be an 
asset of the Trust which will be held by the Trustees of the Foundation  
in favour of the beneficiaries. The Trust being a private trust was made 
for the benefit of various family members which were originally 
named  in the deed of trust, as also for various other activities including 
philanthropic work.  
12.3.  It is axiomatic that trustees hold assets  of a trust not in their personal 
names , but in fiduciary  capacity for the benefit of the name d 
beneficiaries and for the objective s of the trust.  
12.4.  Section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882,  itself  defines  a ‘beneficiary’ , 
‘trustee’  as well as ‘ trust property’. In accordance with the Indian 
Trusts Act, a beneficiary of the trust has a beneficial interest in trust                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                11 of  13  
 
property , which  is the subject matter of the trust. A trustee is one 
holding property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary and has  
specific duties and liabilities . The trustee owes a fiduciary duty to the 
beneficiary.  
12.5.  Therefore, both the registered trademark ‘CINNI ’ of 1981 and the 
impugned registration of the artistic work ‘CINNI ’ in 2016 was in the 
name of the CINNI Foundation / Trust. Who claims to be the trustee 
of the Trust, is clearly a disputed issue as is evident from multifarious  
and hydra -headed  litigation pending between Dipak  Kumar Sah  on 
one side ( claiming through Chandra Kumar Sah, the first Managing 
Trustee) , and Anjan Nara yan Singh (claiming through the 2009 
amendment when he was appointed as the Managing  Trustee with late 
Ravindra Kumar Sah as the Chairman ), on the other side .  
12.6.  It is not within the remit of this Court to enter into this thicket of 
disputes, which is legitimately before the Civil Courts of Varanasi and 
other courts where ancillary proceedings are pending.  
12.7.  In a rectification proceeding for an intellectual property right (in this 
case, registered copyright),  it is only relevant for this Court to 
determine whether the copyright is wrongly registered or wrongly 
maintained on the Register and should be expunged. CINNI 
Foundation , acting through its Trustees , can claim the copyright in the 
artistic work of a trademark which is also registered in the name of the 
CINNI Foundation itself.  
12.8.  The contention of the petitioner’s counsel regarding the 1964 
authorship claimed by Anjan Nara yan Singh would not be therefore                                                                                                          
 
   C.O.(COMM.IPD -CR) 20/2021                                                                                                12 of  13  
 
relevant , in that Anjan Nara yan Singh never claimed or claim s that he , 
in his individual right , was the author of the artistic work. In fact, he 
applied for the registration of the mark as a Managing Trustee of the 
Trust and has no proprietary rights in his personal name.  
12.9.  Further submissions with regard to the non -compliance of Rule 70 of 
the Rules, and a fraud being played on the Register of Copyrights may 
also not be relevant for the reason that it was the Foundation itself, 
acting through its trustees which was applying for the registration.  
12.10.  Dispute as to who was the trustee of the Trust/CINNI Foundation , 
is a matter to be determined by the  competent court. It is clear that the 
assets of intellectual property rights including this copyright would be 
retained in favour of the beneficiaries  of the Trust  by any trustee  who 
claim to be the legitimate trustee of the CINNI Foundation , or one 
who is ultimately declared to be legitimate trustee . The right would 
therefore accrue  in favour of the beneficiary to claim the benefit of the 
copyright , its value and its exploitation.  The trustee would only owe a 
fiduciary duty to the beneficiary with regards to th is trust property.  
13.  For these reasons, it would not be necessary to deal into disputes 
between Dipak Kumar Sah and Anjan Nara yan Singh on the claim of 
who is  Managing  Trustee of  the Trust /CINNI Foundation .  
14.  In light of the statement made by respondent no.1 that the application 
was made on behalf of the Trust/ CINNI Foundation and not in his 
personal capacity, the rectification petition is disposed of with a 
direction  to the Registrar of Copyright  under Section 50 (c) of the Act

to rectify the Register in that the said registration shall be  in the name 
of the Trust  viz. “ CINNI Foundation ”.  
15.  Pending application s, if any, are rendered infructuous.  
16.  It is reiterated that this Court has not made any observations on the 
merits of the disputes between Dipak Kumar Sah and Anjan Nara yan 
Singh or any other claim to the trusteeship of the Trust and has 
restricted itself to its remit under Section 50 of the Act.  
17.  Registry to supply a copy of the order to

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE ANISH DAYAL

     JUDGMENT
ANISH DAYAL, J.
1. This rectification petition has been filed by petitioner under Section 50 of the Copyright Act, 1957, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) seeking removal of the entry made in the register of copyright of the artwork  (hereinafter referred to as impugned artwork) registered under No. A-117189/2017.
2. This petition has been filed by CINNI Foundation (hereinafter referred to as Trust) through Managing Trustee Dipak Kumar Sah. 
3. The grievance is against the impugned artwork being registered as a copyright by Ravindra Kumar Sah and Anjan Narayan Singh, also acting as Chairman and Managing Trustees of the CINNI Foundation. 
4. At the outset, counsel for petitioner as well as respondent no.1 (Anjan Narayan Singh) have apprised this Court that there are several litigations which are pending between Dipak Kumar Sah who was the son of Late Sh. Chandra Kumar Sah, one of the first trustees of the Trust (settled by Raj Kumar Sah and Ravindra Kumar Sah by deed of trust dated 05th November, 2000 in name of CINNI Foundation). 
5. Dipak Kumar Sah relies on clause 5.5 (a) of the deed of trust which states as under:
That Sri Chandra Kumar Sah shall be the first Managing Trustee and he shall continue to be the Managing Trustee for his lifetime. He shall be empowered to nominate any person as his successor to work as Managing Trustee after his lifetime.
6. Dipak Kumar Sah claims that Chandra Kumar Sah (his father) executed a deed dated 25th September 2012, stating inter alia that basis the right to appoint successor Managing Trustee, he was exercising his rights to appoint Dipak Kumar Sah, his son, as lifetime Managing Trustee of CINNI Foundation.  
7. On this basis, Dipak Kumar Sah claims to be Managing Trustee of CINNI Foundation and therefore person aggrieved in respect of the registration of the impugned artwork by inter alia respondent no.1 and Late Shri Ravindra Kumar Sah (the other copyright applicant for the registration who has since passed away in 2019). 
Submissions on behalf of the petitioner
8. Objections taken by petitioners counsel in relation to the impugned work are as under:
8.1.  This impugned artwork was the exact replica of the device mark for CINNI registered by No. 383591 on 27th November 1981 by the partnership, Raj Kumar Sah and Sons (having partners Raj Kumar Sah, Rajendra Kumar Sah and Ravindra Kumar Sah), with their offices in Varanasi (UP). The registered trademark as it appeared in trademark journal in class 11 appended by the petitioner is as under:



8.2.  According to the petitioner, the said trademark was assigned by the partnership vide assignment deed dated 05th November, 2000, which was appended with the petition. Basis the deed of assignment, the partners of M/s Raj Kumar Sah and Sons assigned the registered trademark CINNI along with other Intellectual Property to CINNI Foundation through its Managing Trustee Sh. Chandra Kumar Sah. It was thus claimed that CINNI Foundation acting through Managing Trustee (which Dipak Kumar Sah said he was) was the owner of the registered device mark CINNI. 
8.3.  Being owner of the registered mark since 1981, the copyright in the artwork which was part of the trademark could not have been applied for in 2016 by Ravindra Kumar Sah and Anjan Narayan Singh (who according to Dipak Kumar Sah are wrongly masquerading as Managing Trustees of CINNI Foundation). Not only was the impugned artwork, an integral part of the registered trademark but also authorship of the artwork could not be claimed by the copyright applicants therein. 
8.4.  Serial no. 9 of the statement of particulars of the impugned registration shows 1964 as the year of the first publication. Counsel for petitioner drew attention to the fact that respondent no.1 (Anjan Narayan Singh) as per his affidavit March 2022 claimed to be 51 years on that day and would be therefore born in 1971. Therefore, his claim for authorship of the said mark in 1964 cannot arise and is impossible to accept. Since, the application was jointly filed by respondent no.1 and Ravindra Kumar Sah, it was clearly a fraud played out on the Registrar of Copyright by claiming authorship of both the copyright applicants since 1964. 
8.5.  Petitioners counsel contended that not only was fraud played out upon the Registrar of Copyright, but also the Registrar was amiss in not complying with statutory obligation under the Act:  firstly, Section 45 (1) of the Act mandated that in respect of an artistic work capable of being used in relation to goods and services, the application should be accompanied by a certificate from the Registrar of Trademarks, to the effect that no trademark identical with or deceptively similar to such artistic work had been registered under the Trademark Act. Such a certificate had indeed been provided, however, it did not disclose the registration of the CINNI trademark of 1981 (and other similar marks of CINNI registered at various other points of time); secondly, as per Rule 70(9) mandate of the Copyright Rules 2013 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules) the person applying for registration was mandated to give notice of his application to every person who claims or has interest in the subject matter of the copyright or disputes the applicants rights; thirdly, as per Rules 70 (10) and 70 (11) the Registrar of Copyright was obliged to be satisfied about the correctness of the particulars given in the copyright application and was to hold an inquiry as deemed fit before endorsing a registration of a copyright. Petitioners counsel stated that no such exercise was done, there was no application of mind and no inquiry was ever held, which would itself make the registration invalid. 
8.6.  It was argued that the phrase person aggrieved under Section 50 of the Act had to be liberally constituted including those persons against whom such copyright was being forced. In the circumstances that an FIR had been registered by respondent no.1 against Dipak Kumar Sah in respect of the infringement of copyright, Dipak Kumar Sah would end up being a person aggrieved, as also the Foundation that he claims to be the Managing Trustee of.
8.7.  Petitioners counsel asserted, quite categorically, that even if there were disputes between the parties relating to the trusteeship (through civil suits filed in Varanasi and multifarious litigations), it could not take away from the fact that the impugned artwork could not exist or continue on the Register of Copyright, due process having not been followed as contended above. 
8.8.  Rights in rem could not have been created as asserted by respondent no.1 in respect of the impugned artwork, the rights to which they did not own in law. 

Submissions on behalf of respondent no.1
9. In response counsel for respondent no. 1 laboured on certain facts to assert the position that an application for registration of the mark was made on behalf of CINNI Foundation of which Ravindra Kumar Sah and respondent no.1 were the Managing Trustees in 2016 (when the application was made).
10. Counsel for respondent no.1 categorically stated at the outset that Anjan Narayan Singh (respondent no.1) or anyone else acting on his behalf was not claiming copyright registration in his individual name and acknowledged that it was in the name of the Foundation/Trust.
11.  Submissions in this regard were inter alia as under:
11.1.  Most importantly, he stated that petitioners had suppressed the execution of the deed for amendment of the CINNI Foundation Trust, dated 30th December 2009. This deed, which was appended by respondent No. 1, bears out that it was executed by Ravindra Kumar Sah in the capacity of the settlor of the Trust (the co-settler late Raj Kumar Sah, father of Ravindra Kumar Sah, having passed away). Re-constitution of Board of Trustees was necessitated, as per circumstances stated in the deed of amendment. 
11.2. In terms of clause 13 of the said deed, the new trustees of the Trust were delineated as Ravindra Kumar Sah as Trustee and Chairman, Anjan Narayan Singh as Managing Trustee, Sumit Agrawal and Smita Singh as Trustees. It was pursuant to this amendment, that Ravindra Kumar Sah and Anjan Narayan Singh, as Chairman and Managing Trustee of CINNI Foundation, had filed an application for registration of copyright in 2016. 
11.3. While admitting that Chandra Kumar Sah was the Trustee, in the original Trust Deed, it was stated that pursuant to the said amendment, he did not have any right to nominate Dipak Kumar Sah in 2012 as claimed by petitioner. 
11.4. The amendment was challenged by Chandra Kumar Sah, and the suit filed in 2012 was still pending in District Court Varanasi, and no interim relief had been granted. Therefore, the claim of Dipak Kumar Sah to be the Managing Trustee of CINNI Foundation was untenable and the petitioners locus was therefore questioned on that account. Both, in terms of legal status, as well as being person aggrieved under Section 50 of the Act. Notably, facts relating to the pending litigation proceedings, and there being no interim relief in favour of Dipak Kumar Sah, were not refuted by petitioners counsel. 
11.5. Counsel for respondent no. 1 pointed out the minutes of meeting dated 16th January, 2022 of the Trustees of CINNI Foundation which was attended by Smita Singh, Anjan Narayan Singh and Anvi Singh as Trustees, taking note of this mater being filed by Dipak Kumar Sah and authorising Anjan Narayan Singh to  take all necessary action on behalf of the Trust. 
11.6. The claim of Dipak Kumar Sah to be authorised by CINNI Foundation Trust was questioned on the basis that no resolution or authority had also been filed noting the endorsement by other trustees. Respondents counsel submitted that he was an interloper who could not assert a right on the basis of unilateral nomination by his late father to the post of Managing Trustee. 
11.7. It was pointed out that on 22nd April 2009, due to the anti-trust activity of Chandra Kumar Sah, the other trustees, including his elder son Suraj Kumar Sah, passed a resolution by majority voting and removed Chandra Kumar Sah from the post of Managing Trustee. This was challenged by Chandra Kumar Sah by multiple legal proceedings, details of which may not be necessary and relevant. 
11.8. Respondent nos 1 counsel pointed out that the subsequent development of the 2009 trust deed amendment was allowed to brought on record in 2010, in proceedings before the Delhi High Court. Also, an order dated 01st March, 2013, was passed by this Court noting that, Chandra Kumar Sah was no longer in the management of the Trust, and the Trust itself did not want to pursue the suit. Therefore, the suit was not proceeded ahead with and the matter was subject to the challenge of the amendment. 
Analysis
12.  Having heard counsel for parties and on an assessment of the documents on record and submissions filed, the following appears to this Court as relevant: 
12.1. Aside from the heavily disputed issue of who is the Managing Trustee of the CINNI Foundation, certain basic facts have been clearly admitted by the counsel: firstly, that CINNI Foundation is a registered trust having been originally settled by Raj Kumar Sah and his son Ravindra Kumar Sah on 5th  November, 2000; secondly, Chandra Kumar Sah and Ravindra Kumar Sah were both amongst the first trustees of the said Trust; thirdly, that the registration of the trademark CINNI was in favour of the CINNI Foundation in 1981; fourthly, that the registration of the impugned artwork as a copyright was also made on behalf of the CINNI Foundation (albeit by respondent no. 1 and Ravindra Kumar Sah, basis a claim that they were the new Chairman and Managing Trustee). It is therefore quite evident that no particular individual, in their own right, is claiming the impugned artwork and copyright therein. 
12.2. Needless to say, since Ravindra Kumar Sah has passed away, the other applicant for copyright i.e. respondent no.1 (who is a party in this proceeding) will be bound by this statement and undertaking. It is established that the impugned artwork/copyright was therefore claimed only by the CINNI Foundation/Trust, and therefore will be an asset of the Trust which will be held by the Trustees of the Foundation in favour of the beneficiaries. The Trust being a private trust was made for the benefit of various family members which were originally named in the deed of trust, as also for various other activities including philanthropic work.
12.3.  It is axiomatic that trustees hold assets of a trust not in their personal names, but in fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the named beneficiaries and for the objectives of the trust. 
12.4.  Section 3 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, itself defines a beneficiary, trustee as well as trust property. In accordance with the Indian Trusts Act, a beneficiary of the trust has a beneficial interest in trust property, which is the subject matter of the trust. A trustee is one holding property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiary and has specific duties and liabilities. The trustee owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary. 
12.5.  Therefore, both the registered trademark CINNI of 1981 and the impugned registration of the artistic work CINNI in 2016 was in the name of the CINNI Foundation/ Trust. Who claims to be the trustee of the Trust, is clearly a disputed issue as is evident from multifarious and hydra-headed litigation pending between Dipak Kumar Sah on one side (claiming through Chandra Kumar Sah, the first Managing Trustee), and Anjan Narayan Singh (claiming through the 2009 amendment when he was appointed as the Managing Trustee with late Ravindra Kumar Sah as the Chairman), on the other side. 
12.6.  It is not within the remit of this Court to enter into this thicket of disputes, which is legitimately before the Civil Courts of Varanasi and other courts where ancillary proceedings are pending. 
12.7.  In a rectification proceeding for an intellectual property right (in this case, registered copyright), it is only relevant for this Court to determine whether the copyright is wrongly registered or wrongly maintained on the Register and should be expunged. CINNI Foundation, acting through its Trustees, can claim the copyright in the artistic work of a trademark which is also registered in the name of the CINNI Foundation itself. 
12.8.  The contention of the petitioners counsel regarding the 1964 authorship claimed by Anjan Narayan Singh would not be therefore relevant, in that Anjan Narayan Singh never claimed or claims that he, in his individual right, was the author of the artistic work. In fact, he applied for the registration of the mark as a Managing Trustee of the Trust and has no proprietary rights in his personal name. 
12.9.  Further submissions with regard to the non-compliance of Rule 70 of the Rules, and a fraud being played on the Register of Copyrights may also not be relevant for the reason that it was the Foundation itself, acting through its trustees which was applying for the registration. 
12.10. Dispute as to who was the trustee of the Trust/CINNI Foundation, is a matter to be determined by the competent court. It is clear that the assets of intellectual property rights including this copyright would be retained in favour of the beneficiaries of the Trust by any trustee who claim to be the legitimate trustee of the CINNI Foundation, or one who is ultimately declared to be legitimate trustee. The right would therefore accrue in favour of the beneficiary to claim the benefit of the copyright, its value and its exploitation. The trustee would only owe a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary with regards to this trust property.
13.  For these reasons, it would not be necessary to deal into disputes between Dipak Kumar Sah and Anjan Narayan Singh on the claim of who is Managing Trustee of the Trust/CINNI Foundation. 
14.  In light of the statement made by respondent no.1 that the application was made on behalf of the Trust/ CINNI Foundation and not in his personal capacity, the rectification petition is disposed of with a direction to the Registrar of Copyright under Section 50 (c) of the Act to rectify the Register in that the said registration shall be in the name of the Trust viz. CINNI Foundation. 
15.  Pending applications, if any, are rendered infructuous.
16.  It is reiterated that this Court has not made any observations on the merits of the disputes between Dipak Kumar Sah and Anjan Narayan Singh or any other claim to the trusteeship of the Trust and has restricted itself to its remit under Section 50 of the Act. 
17.  Registry to supply a copy of the order to registrar.copyrights@gov.in for compliance.
18.  Judgment be uploaded on the website of this Court.

PURUSHAINDRA KUMAR KAURAV , J. 
1. The instant appeal at the instance of the  Revenue is filed against 
the order dated 23.04.2018, passed by the  Income Tax Appellate 
Tribunal [ “ITAT” ], setting aside  the order of the Commissioner of 
Income Tax [ “CIT” ] passed under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 
1961 [ “Act” ] for the Assessment Year [ “AY” ] 2002 -03. 
2. The facts of the case exhibit that the respondent -assessee is a 
Non-Banking Financial Company [ “NBFC” ] engaged in the business 
of providing finance to indust ry, trade etc. through hire purchase, lease  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 2 of 14 
 and loans . The respondent -assessee  filed its income tax return  [“ITR” ] 
for the concerned AY on 31.10.2002, declaring its total income to the 
tune of  Rs. 65,41,08,720/ -. The ITR filed by the respondent -assessee 
was processed under Section 143(1) of the Act . Subsequently, a notice 
under Section 143(2) was issued on 28.03.2003, intimating that the case 
of the respondent -assessee has been selected for the scrutiny.  
3. In pursuance of the proceedings under Section 143(3)  of the Act, 
an assessment order was passed by the Revenue on 30.03.2005, 
wherein, the income of the respondent -assessee for the concerned AY 
was assessed at Rs. 87,01,68,210/ -.  
4. However , on 22.03.2007, the CIT while exercising power of 
revision of orders which are erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of 
the Revenue as per Section 263 of the Act, quashed the assessment 
order and remitted the matter  back to the Assessing Officer [ “AO”] for 
a de novo adjudication with respect to the following two claims:  
i. The claim for deduction of Rs. 1114.68 lacs on account of 
provision for non -performing assets.  
ii. The claim for deduction of Rs. 114.06 lacs on account of interest 
rate swap . 
5. In compliance of  the directions passed by the CIT, on 
18.12.2007, the AO adjudicate d the aforesaid two issues afresh and held 
that the expenditure of Rs. 2,28,35,593/ - was capital in nature and the 
same was consequently, disallowed. Being aggrieved by the order of 
AO dated 18.12.2007, the respondent -assessee preferred an appeal 
before th e Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals ) [“CIT (A)” ], which 
came to be dismissed vide order dated 28.10.2011. The said appeal was  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 3 of 14 
 rejected on the grounds that (a) the claim of the respondent -assessee 
with respect to the loss of Rs. 2,28,35,593 being normal b usiness loss 
during the concerned AY was unsustainable and (b) the expenditure was 
in relation to the protection of any higher payment of principal amount 
and not due to any interest payable on such loan raised in foreign 
exchange.  
6. Thereafter, the responde nt-assessee filed an appeal before the 
ITAT challenging the order dated 22.03.2007  passed by the CIT under 
Section 263 of the Act  and subsequent order dated 28.10.2011  passed 
by the CIT (A) . The ITAT vide impugned order dated 23.04.2018 
invalidated the ord er of the CIT , mainly for the following reasons : 
i. There was no error or prejudice to the interest of the Revenue as 
no deduction on account of provision for non -performing assets 
was allowed to the respondent -assessee.  
ii. The interest rate swap was an actual l oss and only the net loss of 
Rs. 114.05 lacs after setting of gain of interest rate swap was 
claimed as deduction.  
iii. Both  the abovementioned issues were duly examined by the AO 
vide questionnaire dated 02.11.2004 to which replies dated 
09.12.2004, 20.12.200 4 and 06.01.2005 were duly furnishe d by 
the respondent -assessee . 
7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue submit s that 
the ITAT erred in setting aside the revisional order under Section 263 of 
the Act, inasmuch as, the AO ha d failed to record any  finding with 
respect to the above mentioned two issues in the assessment order. He 
submits that there is nothing on record which could signify due  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 4 of 14 
 application of mind on the part of the AO while allowing the claims of 
the respondent -assessee . He, therefor e, submits that the revisional 
authority has rightly held that the AO has failed to make any enquiry 
and merely accepted the version of the respondent -assessee.  
8. He further contends that any order passed by the AO without 
carrying out necessary verification , would be deemed to be erroneous 
as per Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act. While taking this Court 
through the original assessment order at Annexure A -1, he submits that 
the AO has merely sought details with respect to the claims in question, 
howeve r, the same cannot be construed as an enquiry for the purpose of 
satisfying the conditions laid down in Section 263 of the Act. Learned 
counsel further submits that if the assessment order is read in 
juxtaposition with questionnaire dated 02.11.2004, the s ame would 
indicate that the AO has not decided anything in respect of allowability 
of the said claims.  
9. Learned counsel for the Revenue has drawn our attention to 
Paragraph 4 of the order dated 22.03.2007, wherein, CIT has placed 
reliance on the decision of  the Orissa High Court in the case of 
Umashanker Rice Mill  v. CIT  [1990 SCC OnLine Ori 368 ] to hold 
that the power under Section 263 of the Act is available to be exercised 
by the CIT, if on the basis of the material available on records, the CIT 
feels tha t there should be further enquiry.  
10. Learned counsel  has also placed reliance on the decision of the 
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. v. 
CIT [(2000) 2 SCC 718] to substantiate his arguments.   
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 5 of 14 
 11. Learned counsel for the responden t-assessee,  on the other hand, 
vehemently opposed the submissions canvassed by the Revenue. He 
submits that the instant case cannot be said to be a case of lack of 
enquiry as the Revenue has itself not denied that both the issues in 
question were specifica lly enquired by the AO vide notice dated 
02.11.20 04 and subsequently responded by the respondent -assessee 
vide replies dated 09.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 06.01.2005. He also 
submits that at the time of scrutiny assessment, the AO vide notice 
dated 02.11.2004  had specifically put an enquiry about the provision for 
doubtful assets amounting to Rs. 8,34,22,265/ -. According to him, since 
the AO was not completely satisfied with the replies submitted by the 
respondent -assessee with respect to the said notice,  the AO made an 
addition of Rs. 73,46,160/ - considering that the respondent -assessee 
had already disallowed Rs. 7,60,76,105/ - in its computation of total 
income. He, therefore, contends  that the AO has passed the assessment 
order after diligently carrying out t he assessment and there is no reason 
to assail the same on the pretext of non -application of mind.  
12. He submits that since the respondent -assessee does not exercise 
any control over the drafting of the assessment order, therefore, the 
record of the assessmen t must be seen in its entirety to determine 
whether any enquiry was made or not.  According to him, t he 
assessment order may not necessarily reflect everything that an AO 
asks for but that cannot lead to the conclusion  that the issue has not 
been raised or examined.  He further submits that the provisions of the 
Act do not envision recording of each and every finding in the 
assessment order, however, the same cannot lead to a far -fetched  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 6 of 14 
 conclusion that no enquiry has been  conducted qua the issues not 
properl y elucidated in the assessment order.  
13. He further contends that once it appears that the AO has 
conducted the enquiry on the issues on which the concerned authority 
seeks to exercise jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act, the said 
authority must record  conclusive findings of error and prejudice and 
cannot remit back the issues for a fresh consideration.  
14. Learned counsel has placed reliance on the decisions in the cases 
of Hari Iron Trading Co. v. CIT  [(2003) 263 ITR 43 7 (P&H) ], CIT 
v. Eicher Ltd.  [(2007) 294 ITR 310 (Del.) ], CIT v. Gabriel India Ltd.  
[(1993) 203 ITR 108 ], CIT v. Nirma Chemicals Ltd.  [(2009 ) 309 ITR 
67], CIT v. Ashish Rajpal  [(2010) 320 ITR 674 (Delhi)] . 
15. We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the 
parties and perused the  record.  
16. Vide order dated 06.11.2019, this Court framed the following 
question of law: - 
“A. Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the Hon'ble 
ITAT was justified in quashing the order under Section 263 of the 
Income Tax Act? ” 
17. The brief contro versy involved in the present appeal pertains to 
the invocation of revisional jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act by 
the CIT to set aside the  original  assessment order  dated 30.03.2005 . 
18. Before adverting to the merits of the case, it is apposite to re fer to 
the power of  the revisional authority of the CIT envisaged as per 
Section 263 of the Act. For the sake of clarity, the relevant extract of 
Section 263  of the Act  is reproduced as under:   
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 7 of 14 
 “263. Revision of orders prejudicial to revenue —(1) The  
[Princi pal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal 
Commissioner] or Commissioner] may call for and examine the 
record of any proceeding under this Act, and if he considers that any 
order passed therein by the Assessing Officer [or the Transfer Prici ng 
Officer, as the case may be,] is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial 
to the interest of the revenue, he may, after giving the assessee an 
opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made 
such inquiry as he deems necessary, pass suc h order thereon as the 
circumstances of the case justify,   [including, — 
(i) an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the 
assessment and directing a fresh assessment; or  
(ii) an order modifying the order under Section 92 -CA; or  
(iii) an order cancelling the order under Section 92 -CA and directing 
a fresh order under the said section.]  
*** 
 [Explanation 2 .— For the purposes of this section, it is hereby 
declared that an order passed by the Assessing Officer  [or the 
Transfer Pricing Officer , as the case may be,] shall be deemed to be 
erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue, 
if, in the opinion of the Principal  [Chief Commissioner or Chief 
Commissioner or Principal] Commissioner or Commissioner, — 
(a) the order is passed without making inquiries or verification 
which should have been made;  
(b) the order is passed allowing any relief without inquiring into 
the claim;  
(c) the order has not been made in accordance with any order, 
direction or instruction issued by t he Board under Section 
119; or  
(d) the order has not been passed in accordance with any decision 
which is prejudicial to the assessee, rendered by the 
jurisdictional High Court or Supreme Court in the case of the 
assessee or any other person.]  
***” 
19. A bare reading of sub -Section (1) of Section 263 of the Act 
makes it abundantly clear  that the said provision lays down a two -
pronged test to exercise the revisional authority i.e., firstly, the  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 8 of 14 
 assessment order must be erroneous and secondly, it must be prejudic ial 
to the interests of the Revenue. Further, Explanation 2 to Section 263 of 
the Act delineates  certain conditions and circumstances when the order 
passed by the AO can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the 
Revenue.  
20. Clause (a) of Explanation 2 to  Section 263 of the Act  further  
stipulates that if an order is passed without making an enquiry or 
verification which should have been made, the same would bestow a 
revisional power upon the Commissioner . However, the said Clause or 
any other condition lai d down in Explanation 2 do es not warrant 
recording of the said enquiry or verification in its entirety in the 
assessment order.  
21. Admittedly, in the instant case, the questionnaire dated 
02.11.2004 , which has been annexed and brought on record in the 
present  appeal,  would manifest that the AO had asked for the 
allowability of the claim s with respect to the issues in question . 
Consequently,  the respondent -assessee duly furnished explanations 
thereof vide replies dated 09.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 06.01.2005 . 
Thus, it is not a case where no enquiry whatsoever has been conducted 
by the AO with respect to the claims under consideration. However, this 
leads us to an ancillary  question whether the mandate of law for 
invoking the powers under Section 263 of the Act includes the  cases 
where either an adequate enquiry has not been made and the same has 
not been recorded in the order of assessment or the said authority  is 
circumscribed  to only consider the cases where no enquiry has been 
conducted at all.   
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 9 of 14 
 22. Reliance can be  placed on the decision of this Court in the case 
of CIT v. Sunbeam Auto Ltd. [2009 SCC OnLine Del 4237 ], wherein, 
it was held that if the AO has not provided detailed reasons with respect 
to each and every item of deduction etc. in the assessment order, t hat by 
itself would not reflect a non-application of mind by the AO. It was 
further held that merely inadequacy of enquiry would not confer the 
power of revision under Section 263 of the Act on the Commissioner. 
The relevant paragraph of the said decision reads as under: -  
“17. We have considered the rival submissions of the counsel on the 
other side and have gone through the records. The first issue that 
arises for our consideration is about the exercise of power by the 
Commissioner of Income -tax under sec tion 263 of the Income -tax 
Act. As noted above, the submission of learned counsel for the 
Revenue was that while passing the assessment order, the Assessing 
Officer did not consider this aspect specifically whether the 
expenditure in question was revenue o r capital expenditure. This 
argument predicates on the assessment order, which apparently does 
not give any reasons while allowing the entire expenditure as revenue 
expenditure. However, that by itself would not be indicative of the 
fact that the Assessing  Officer had not applied his mind on the issue. 
There are judgments galore laying down the principle that the 
Assessing  Officer in the assessment order is not required to give 
detailed reason in respect of each and every item of deduction, 
etc. Therefore, one has to see from the record as to whether there was 
application of mind before allowing the expenditure in question as 
revenue expenditure. Learned counsel for the assessee is right in 
his submission that one has to keep in mind the distinction 
between ""lack of inquiry"" and ""inadequate inquiry"". If there 
was any inquiry, even inadequate that would not by itself give 
occasion to the Commissioner to pass orders under section 263 of 
the Act, merely because he has a different opinion in the matter. 
It is onl y in cases of ""lack of inquiry"" that such a course of action 
would be open.  In Gabriel India Ltd. (1993) 203 ITR 108 (Bom), 
law on this aspect was discussed in the following manner (page 113)  
***”  
23. A similar view was taken by this Court in the case of CIT v . Anil 
Kumar Sharma [2010 SCC OnLine Del 838] , wherein, it was held that  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 10 of 14 
 once it is inferred from the record of assessment that AO has applied its 
mind, the proceedings under Section 263 of the Act would fall in the 
category of Commissioner having a differ ent opinion. Paragraph 8 of 
the said decision reads as under: - 
“8. In view of the above discussion, it is apparent that the Tribunal 
arrived at a conclusive finding that, though the assessment order does 
not patently indicate that the issue in question had  been considered by 
the Assessing Officer, the record showed that the Assessing Officer 
had applied his mind. Once such application of mind is discernible 
from the record, the proceedings under section 263 would fall into the 
area of the Commissioner havin g a different opinion. We are of the 
view that the findings of facts arrived at by the Tribunal do not 
warrant interference of this court. That being the position, the present 
case would not be one of ""lack of inquiry"" and, even if the inquiry 
was termed i nadequate, following the decision in Sunbeam Auto Ltd. 
(2011) 332 ITR 167 (Delhi) (page 180) : ""that would not by itself 
give occasion to the Commissioner to pass orders under section 263 
of the Act, merely because he has a different opinion in the matter. "" 
No substantial question of law arises for our consideration. ” 
24. In Ashish Rajpal as well , this Court was of the view that the fact 
that a query was raised during the course of scrutiny which was 
satisfactorily answered by the assessee but did not get refle cted in the 
assessment order, would not by itself lead to a conclusion that there was 
no enquiry with respect to transactions carried out by the assessee.  
25. Further, t he decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of 
Malabar  Industrial Co. Ltd.,  enunci ates the meaning and intent of the 
phrase “prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue”, in the following 
words: - 
“8. The phrase “prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue” is not an 
expression of art and is not defined in the Act. Understood in its 
ordinary meaning it is of wide import and is not confined to loss of 
tax. The High Court of Calcutta in  Dawjee Dadabhoy & Co.  v. S.P. 
Jain [(1957) 31 ITR 872  (Cal)], the High Court of Karnataka 
in CIT v. T. Narayana Pai  [(1975) 98 ITR 422  (Kant)], the High 
Court of Bombay in  CIT v. Gabriel India Ltd.  [(1993) 203 ITR  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 11 of 14 
 108(Bom)] and the High Court of Gujarat in  CIT v. Minalben S. 
Parikh  [(1995) 215 ITR 81  (Guj)] treated loss of tax as prejudicial to 
the interests of the Revenue.  
9. Mr. Abraham relied on the judgme nt of the Division Bench of 
the High Court of Madras in  Venkatakrishna Rice Co.  v. CIT [(1987) 
163 ITR 129  (Mad)] interpreting “prejudicial to the interests of the 
Revenue”. The High Court held:  
“In this context, (it must) be regarded as involving a concep tion 
of acts or orders which are subversive of the administration of 
revenue. There must be some grievous error in the order passed by 
the Income Tax Officer, which might set a bad trend or pattern for 
similar assessments, which on a broad reckoning, the C ommissioner 
might think to be prejudicial to the interests of Revenue 
Administration.”  
In our view this interpretation is too narrow to merit acceptance. 
The scheme of the Act is to levy and collect tax in accordance with 
the provisions of the Act and this  task is entrusted to the Revenue. If 
due to an erroneous order of the Income Tax Officer, the Revenue is 
losing tax lawfully payable by a person, it will certainly be 
prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue.  
10. The phrase “prejudicial to the interest s of the Revenue” has to 
be read in conjunction with an erroneous order passed by the 
Assessing Officer. Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an 
order of the Assessing Officer cannot be treated as prejudicial to 
the interests of the Revenue, for examp le, when an Income Tax 
Officer adopted one of the courses permissible in law and it has 
resulted in loss of revenue; or where two views are possible and 
the Income Tax Officer has taken one view with which the 
Commissioner does not agree, it cannot be trea ted as an 
erroneous order prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue unless 
the view taken by the Income Tax Officer is unsustainable in law.  
It has been held by this Court that where a sum not earned by a 
person is assessed as income in his hands on his so offering, the order 
passed by the Assessing Officer accepting the same as such will be 
erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. 
(See Rampyari Devi Saraogi  v. CIT [(1968) 67 ITR 84  (SC)] and 
in Tara Devi Aggarwal  v. CIT [(1973) 3 SCC 48 2 : 1973 SCC (Tax) 
318 : (1973) 88 ITR 323].)”  
[Emphasis supplied]  
26. Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT v. 
Paville Projects (P) Ltd. [2023 SCC OnLine SC 371 ], while relying  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 12 of 14 
 upon Malabar  Industrial Co. Ltd., has discussed the sanctity of t wo-
fold conditions  for the purpose of invoking jurisdiction under Section 
263 of the Act. The relevant paragraph of the said decision reads as 
under :- 
“27. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee has heavily 
relied upon the decision of this Cou rt in the case of  Malabar 
Industrial Co. Ltd.  (supra). It is true that in the said decision and on 
interpretation of Section  263 of the  Income Tax Act, it is observed 
and held that in order to exercise the jurisdiction under 
Section  263(1)  of the  Income ta x Act, the Commissioner has to be 
satisfied of twin conditions, namely, (i) the order of the Assessing 
Officer sought to be revised is erroneous; and (ii) it is prejudicial to 
the interests of the Revenue. It is further observed that if one of them 
is abse nt, recourse cannot be had to Section 263(1) of the Act.  
***”  
27. Considering the aforesaid judicial pronouncements , it can be 
safely concluded that inadequacy of enquiry by the AO with respect to 
certain claims would not in itself be a reason to invoke the p owers 
enshrined in Section 263 of the Act. The Revenue in the instant case 
has not been able to make out a sufficient case that the CIT has 
exercised the power in accordance with law. Rather, in our considered 
opinion, the facts of the case do not indicate  that the twin conditions 
contained in Section 263 of the Act are fulfilled in its letter and spirit.  
28. Notably, the ITAT , while making a categorical finding that the 
CIT had failed to point out  any definite or specific error in the 
assessment order, has sat isfactorily explained both the claims in 
question  in Paragraph 8.2 of its order, which reads as under :-  
“8.2 In the Impugned Order, the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax -IV, 
Delhi held that the AO had not examined the aforesaid two issues 
properly and, there fore, set aside the issues for further inquiries to be 
conducted by the AO. As regards the first issue is concerned, we note 
that out of total provision of Rs. 1114.68 lacs, a sum of Rs.  
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 13 of 14 
 7,60,76,105/ - was suo moto added back in the computation of income 
and a further sum of Rs. 73,46,160 - was disallowed by the AO in the 
original assessment order dated 30.3.2005. Therefore, out of Rs. 1114.68 
lacs, Rs. 834.22 lacs already stood disallowed in the original assessment 
order. The balance amount represented actua l write off which was 
palpably clear from page 2 of the impugned order itself. No deduction 
on account of any such provision was, therefore, allowed to the assessee . 
Hence, there is no error or prejudice to the interest of revenue. As 
regards second issue it was noted that interest rate swap was an actual 
loss and only the net loss of Rs. 114.05 lacs after setting of gain of 
interest rate swap was claimed as deduction. However, we find that both 
these issues were duly examined by the AO vide Questionnaire d ated 
2.11.2004 (Page 1 -2 of the Paper Book) to which replies dated 
9.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 6.1.2005 (Page No. 3 -39 of Paper Book -1) 
were furnished and, therefore, the finding of the Ld. CIT that the issues 
were not examined properly was not correct. Even  the Ld. CIT has not 
pointed out the definite and specific error in the original assessment 
order and observed that the inquiry made by the AO was inadequate or 
improper without first pointing out the error in the original assessment 
order passed by the AO , particularly because both the aforesaid issues 
were duly examined at the stage of the original assessment proceedings, 
hence, the impugned order is beyond jurisdiction, bad in law and void -
ab-initio. ” 
29. It is discernible from the aforenoted findings of the  ITAT that 
both the claims were duly examined during the original assessment 
proceedings itself and neither there was any error nor the same was 
prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. Thus, the findings of fact 
arrived at by the ITAT do not warrant a ny interference of this Court.  
30. So far as the reliance placed by the CIT on Umashankar Rice 
Mill is concerned , the same is misplaced, particularly in light of the 
insertion of Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act, brought in place 
by the Finance Act, 201 5. The said amendment markedly specifies 
various conditions to exercise the authority vested in the Commissioner 
under Section 263 of the Act, leaving no ambiguity in the interpretation 
of the said provision.   
 
 
 
ITA 1428/2018   Page 14 of 14 
 31. In view of the aforesaid, t he appeal preferred by the Revenue  is 
dismissed alongwith the pending application (s), if any .

     HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE YASHWANT VARMA
HONBLE MR. JUSTICE PURUSHAINDRA KUMAR KAURAV 
       
J U D G M E N T

PURUSHAINDRA KUMAR KAURAV, J.
1. The instant appeal at the instance of the Revenue is filed against the order dated 23.04.2018, passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal [ITAT], setting aside the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax [CIT] passed under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 [Act] for the Assessment Year [AY] 2002-03.
2. The facts of the case exhibit that the respondent-assessee is a Non-Banking Financial Company [NBFC] engaged in the business of providing finance to industry, trade etc. through hire purchase, lease and loans. The respondent-assessee filed its income tax return [ITR] for the concerned AY on 31.10.2002, declaring its total income to the tune of Rs. 65,41,08,720/-. The ITR filed by the respondent-assessee was processed under Section 143(1) of the Act. Subsequently, a notice under Section 143(2) was issued on 28.03.2003, intimating that the case of the respondent-assessee has been selected for the scrutiny. 
3. In pursuance of the proceedings under Section 143(3) of the Act, an assessment order was passed by the Revenue on 30.03.2005, wherein, the income of the respondent-assessee for the concerned AY was assessed at Rs. 87,01,68,210/-. 
4. However, on 22.03.2007, the CIT while exercising power of revision of orders which are erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue as per Section 263 of the Act, quashed the assessment order and remitted the matter back to the Assessing Officer [AO] for a de novo adjudication with respect to the following two claims:
i. The claim for deduction of Rs. 1114.68 lacs on account of provision for non-performing assets.
ii. The claim for deduction of Rs. 114.06 lacs on account of interest rate swap.
5. In compliance of the directions passed by the CIT, on 18.12.2007, the AO adjudicated the aforesaid two issues afresh and held that the expenditure of Rs. 2,28,35,593/- was capital in nature and the same was consequently, disallowed. Being aggrieved by the order of AO dated 18.12.2007, the respondent-assessee preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT (A)], which came to be dismissed vide order dated 28.10.2011. The said appeal was rejected on the grounds that (a) the claim of the respondent-assessee with respect to the loss of Rs. 2,28,35,593 being normal business loss during the concerned AY was unsustainable and (b) the expenditure was in relation to the protection of any higher payment of principal amount and not due to any interest payable on such loan raised in foreign exchange.
6. Thereafter, the respondent-assessee filed an appeal before the ITAT challenging the order dated 22.03.2007 passed by the CIT under Section 263 of the Act and subsequent order dated 28.10.2011 passed by the CIT (A). The ITAT vide impugned order dated 23.04.2018 invalidated the order of the CIT, mainly for the following reasons:
i. There was no error or prejudice to the interest of the Revenue as no deduction on account of provision for non-performing assets was allowed to the respondent-assessee.
ii. The interest rate swap was an actual loss and only the net loss of Rs. 114.05 lacs after setting of gain of interest rate swap was claimed as deduction. 
iii. Both the abovementioned issues were duly examined by the AO vide questionnaire dated 02.11.2004 to which replies dated 09.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 06.01.2005 were duly furnished by the respondent-assessee.
7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Revenue submits that the ITAT erred in setting aside the revisional order under Section 263 of the Act, inasmuch as, the AO had failed to record any finding with respect to the above mentioned two issues in the assessment order. He submits that there is nothing on record which could signify due application of mind on the part of the AO while allowing the claims of the respondent-assessee. He, therefore, submits that the revisional authority has rightly held that the AO has failed to make any enquiry and merely accepted the version of the respondent-assessee.
8. He further contends that any order passed by the AO without carrying out necessary verification, would be deemed to be erroneous as per Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act. While taking this Court through the original assessment order at Annexure A-1, he submits that the AO has merely sought details with respect to the claims in question, however, the same cannot be construed as an enquiry for the purpose of satisfying the conditions laid down in Section 263 of the Act. Learned counsel further submits that if the assessment order is read in juxtaposition with questionnaire dated 02.11.2004, the same would indicate that the AO has not decided anything in respect of allowability of the said claims.
9. Learned counsel for the Revenue has drawn our attention to Paragraph 4 of the order dated 22.03.2007, wherein, CIT has placed reliance on the decision of the Orissa High Court in the case of Umashanker Rice Mill v. CIT [1990 SCC OnLine Ori 368] to hold that the power under Section 263 of the Act is available to be exercised by the CIT, if on the basis of the material available on records, the CIT feels that there should be further enquiry. 
10. Learned counsel has also placed reliance on the decision of the Honble Supreme Court in the case of Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. v. CIT [(2000) 2 SCC 718] to substantiate his arguments. 
11. Learned counsel for the respondent-assessee, on the other hand, vehemently opposed the submissions canvassed by the Revenue. He submits that the instant case cannot be said to be a case of lack of enquiry as the Revenue has itself not denied that both the issues in question were specifically enquired by the AO vide notice dated 02.11.2004 and subsequently responded by the respondent-assessee vide replies dated 09.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 06.01.2005. He also submits that at the time of scrutiny assessment, the AO vide notice dated 02.11.2004 had specifically put an enquiry about the provision for doubtful assets amounting to Rs. 8,34,22,265/-. According to him, since the AO was not completely satisfied with the replies submitted by the respondent-assessee with respect to the said notice, the AO made an addition of Rs. 73,46,160/- considering that the respondent-assessee had already disallowed Rs. 7,60,76,105/- in its computation of total income. He, therefore, contends that the AO has passed the assessment order after diligently carrying out the assessment and there is no reason to assail the same on the pretext of non-application of mind.
12. He submits that since the respondent-assessee does not exercise any control over the drafting of the assessment order, therefore, the record of the assessment must be seen in its entirety to determine whether any enquiry was made or not. According to him, the assessment order may not necessarily reflect everything that an AO asks for but that cannot lead to the conclusion that the issue has not been raised or examined. He further submits that the provisions of the Act do not envision recording of each and every finding in the assessment order, however, the same cannot lead to a far-fetched conclusion that no enquiry has been conducted qua the issues not properly elucidated in the assessment order. 
13. He further contends that once it appears that the AO has conducted the enquiry on the issues on which the concerned authority seeks to exercise jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act, the said authority must record conclusive findings of error and prejudice and cannot remit back the issues for a fresh consideration. 
14. Learned counsel has placed reliance on the decisions in the cases of Hari Iron Trading Co. v. CIT [(2003) 263 ITR 43 7 (P&H)], CIT v. Eicher Ltd. [(2007) 294 ITR 310 (Del.)], CIT v. Gabriel India Ltd. [(1993) 203 ITR 108], CIT v. Nirma Chemicals Ltd. [(2009) 309 ITR 67], CIT v. Ashish Rajpal [(2010) 320 ITR 674 (Delhi)].
15. We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties and perused the record.
16. Vide order dated 06.11.2019, this Court framed the following question of law:-
A. Whether, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the Hon'ble ITAT was justified in quashing the order under Section 263 of the Income Tax Act?
17. The brief controversy involved in the present appeal pertains to the invocation of revisional jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act by the CIT to set aside the original assessment order dated 30.03.2005.
18. Before adverting to the merits of the case, it is apposite to refer to the power of the revisional authority of the CIT envisaged as per Section 263 of the Act. For the sake of clarity, the relevant extract of Section 263 of the Act is reproduced as under:
   263. Revision of orders prejudicial to revenue(1) The [Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner] or Commissioner] may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act, and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Assessing Officer [or the Transfer Pricing Officer, as the case may be,] is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, he may, after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary, pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify,  [including,
(i) an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment; or
(ii) an order modifying the order under Section 92-CA; or
(iii) an order cancelling the order under Section 92-CA and directing a fresh order under the said section.]
***
    [Explanation 2. For the purposes of this section, it is hereby declared that an order passed by the Assessing Officer [or the Transfer Pricing Officer, as the case may be,] shall be deemed to be erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue, if, in the opinion of the Principal [Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal] Commissioner or Commissioner,
(a) the order is passed without making inquiries or verification which should have been made;
(b) the order is passed allowing any relief without inquiring into the claim;
(c) the order has not been made in accordance with any order, direction or instruction issued by the Board under Section 119; or
(d) the order has not been passed in accordance with any decision which is prejudicial to the assessee, rendered by the jurisdictional High Court or Supreme Court in the case of the assessee or any other person.]
***
19. A bare reading of sub-Section (1) of Section 263 of the Act makes it abundantly clear that the said provision lays down a two-pronged test to exercise the revisional authority i.e., firstly, the assessment order must be erroneous and secondly, it must be prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. Further, Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act delineates certain conditions and circumstances when the order passed by the AO can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the Revenue.
20. Clause (a) of Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act further stipulates that if an order is passed without making an enquiry or verification which should have been made, the same would bestow a revisional power upon the Commissioner. However, the said Clause or any other condition laid down in Explanation 2 does not warrant recording of the said enquiry or verification in its entirety in the assessment order.
21. Admittedly, in the instant case, the questionnaire dated 02.11.2004, which has been annexed and brought on record in the present appeal, would manifest that the AO had asked for the allowability of the claims with respect to the issues in question. Consequently, the respondent-assessee duly furnished explanations thereof vide replies dated 09.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 06.01.2005. Thus, it is not a case where no enquiry whatsoever has been conducted by the AO with respect to the claims under consideration. However, this leads us to an ancillary question? whether the mandate of law for invoking the powers under Section 263 of the Act includes the cases where either an adequate enquiry has not been made and the same has not been recorded in the order of assessment or the said authority is circumscribed to only consider the cases where no enquiry has been conducted at all. 
22. Reliance can be placed on the decision of this Court in the case of CIT v. Sunbeam Auto Ltd. [2009 SCC OnLine Del 4237], wherein, it was held that if the AO has not provided detailed reasons with respect to each and every item of deduction etc. in the assessment order, that by itself would not reflect a non-application of mind by the AO. It was further held that merely inadequacy of enquiry would not confer the power of revision under Section 263 of the Act on the Commissioner. The relevant paragraph of the said decision reads as under:- 
17. We have considered the rival submissions of the counsel on the other side and have gone through the records. The first issue that arises for our consideration is about the exercise of power by the Commissioner of Income-tax under section 263 of the Income-tax Act. As noted above, the submission of learned counsel for the Revenue was that while passing the assessment order, the Assessing Officer did not consider this aspect specifically whether the expenditure in question was revenue or capital expenditure. This argument predicates on the assessment order, which apparently does not give any reasons while allowing the entire expenditure as revenue expenditure. However, that by itself would not be indicative of the fact that the Assessing Officer had not applied his mind on the issue. There are judgments galore laying down the principle that the Assessing Officer in the assessment order is not required to give detailed reason in respect of each and every item of deduction, etc. Therefore, one has to see from the record as to whether there was application of mind before allowing the expenditure in question as revenue expenditure. Learned counsel for the assessee is right in his submission that one has to keep in mind the distinction between ""lack of inquiry"" and ""inadequate inquiry"". If there was any inquiry, even inadequate that would not by itself give occasion to the Commissioner to pass orders under section 263 of the Act, merely because he has a different opinion in the matter. It is only in cases of ""lack of inquiry"" that such a course of action would be open. In Gabriel India Ltd. (1993) 203 ITR 108 (Bom), law on this aspect was discussed in the following manner (page 113)
      ***
23. A similar view was taken by this Court in the case of CIT v. Anil Kumar Sharma [2010 SCC OnLine Del 838], wherein, it was held that once it is inferred from the record of assessment that AO has applied its mind, the proceedings under Section 263 of the Act would fall in the category of Commissioner having a different opinion. Paragraph 8 of the said decision reads as under:-
8. In view of the above discussion, it is apparent that the Tribunal arrived at a conclusive finding that, though the assessment order does not patently indicate that the issue in question had been considered by the Assessing Officer, the record showed that the Assessing Officer had applied his mind. Once such application of mind is discernible from the record, the proceedings under section 263 would fall into the area of the Commissioner having a different opinion. We are of the view that the findings of facts arrived at by the Tribunal do not warrant interference of this court. That being the position, the present case would not be one of ""lack of inquiry"" and, even if the inquiry was termed inadequate, following the decision in Sunbeam Auto Ltd. (2011) 332 ITR 167 (Delhi) (page 180) : ""that would not by itself give occasion to the Commissioner to pass orders under section 263 of the Act, merely because he has a different opinion in the matter."" No substantial question of law arises for our consideration.
24. In Ashish Rajpal as well, this Court was of the view that the fact that a query was raised during the course of scrutiny which was satisfactorily answered by the assessee but did not get reflected in the assessment order, would not by itself lead to a conclusion that there was no enquiry with respect to transactions carried out by the assessee.
25. Further, the decision of the Honble Supreme Court in the case of Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd., enunciates the meaning and intent of the phrase prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, in the following words:-
8. The phrase prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue is not an expression of art and is not defined in the Act. Understood in its ordinary meaning it is of wide import and is not confined to loss of tax. The High Court of Calcutta in Dawjee Dadabhoy & Co. v. S.P. Jain [(1957) 31 ITR 872 (Cal)], the High Court of Karnataka in CIT v. T. Narayana Pai [(1975) 98 ITR 422 (Kant)], the High Court of Bombay in CIT v. Gabriel India Ltd. [(1993) 203 ITR 108(Bom)] and the High Court of Gujarat in CIT v. Minalben S. Parikh [(1995) 215 ITR 81 (Guj)] treated loss of tax as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue.
   9. Mr. Abraham relied on the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of Madras in Venkatakrishna Rice Co. v. CIT [(1987) 163 ITR 129 (Mad)] interpreting prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. The High Court held:
   In this context, (it must) be regarded as involving a conception of acts or orders which are subversive of the administration of revenue. There must be some grievous error in the order passed by the Income Tax Officer, which might set a bad trend or pattern for similar assessments, which on a broad reckoning, the Commissioner might think to be prejudicial to the interests of Revenue Administration.
   In our view this interpretation is too narrow to merit acceptance. The scheme of the Act is to levy and collect tax in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this task is entrusted to the Revenue. If due to an erroneous order of the Income Tax Officer, the Revenue is losing tax lawfully payable by a person, it will certainly be prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue.
   10. The phrase prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue has to be read in conjunction with an erroneous order passed by the Assessing Officer. Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an order of the Assessing Officer cannot be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue, for example, when an Income Tax Officer adopted one of the courses permissible in law and it has resulted in loss of revenue; or where two views are possible and the Income Tax Officer has taken one view with which the Commissioner does not agree, it cannot be treated as an erroneous order prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue unless the view taken by the Income Tax Officer is unsustainable in law. It has been held by this Court that where a sum not earned by a person is assessed as income in his hands on his so offering, the order passed by the Assessing Officer accepting the same as such will be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. (See Rampyari Devi Saraogi v. CIT [(1968) 67 ITR 84 (SC)] and in Tara Devi Aggarwal v. CIT [(1973) 3 SCC 482 : 1973 SCC (Tax) 318 : (1973) 88 ITR 323].)
   [Emphasis supplied]
26. Recently, the Honble Supreme Court in the case of CIT v. Paville Projects (P) Ltd. [2023 SCC OnLine SC 371], while relying upon Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd., has discussed the sanctity of two-fold conditions for the purpose of invoking jurisdiction under Section 263 of the Act. The relevant paragraph of the said decision reads as under:-
27. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee has heavily relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. (supra). It is true that in the said decision and on interpretation of Section 263 of the Income Tax Act, it is observed and held that in order to exercise the jurisdiction under Section 263(1) of the Income tax Act, the Commissioner has to be satisfied of twin conditions, namely, (i) the order of the Assessing Officer sought to be revised is erroneous; and (ii) it is prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. It is further observed that if one of them is absent, recourse cannot be had to Section 263(1) of the Act. 
***
27. Considering the aforesaid judicial pronouncements, it can be safely concluded that inadequacy of enquiry by the AO with respect to certain claims would not in itself be a reason to invoke the powers enshrined in Section 263 of the Act. The Revenue in the instant case has not been able to make out a sufficient case that the CIT has exercised the power in accordance with law. Rather, in our considered opinion, the facts of the case do not indicate that the twin conditions contained in Section 263 of the Act are fulfilled in its letter and spirit.
28. Notably, the ITAT, while making a categorical finding that the CIT had failed to point out any definite or specific error in the assessment order, has satisfactorily explained both the claims in question in Paragraph 8.2 of its order, which reads as under:- 
8.2 In the Impugned Order, the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax-IV, Delhi held that the AO had not examined the aforesaid two issues properly and, therefore, set aside the issues for further inquiries to be conducted by the AO. As regards the first issue is concerned, we note that out of total provision of Rs. 1114.68 lacs, a sum of Rs. 7,60,76,105/- was suo moto added back in the computation of income and a further sum of Rs. 73,46,160- was disallowed by the AO in the original assessment order dated 30.3.2005. Therefore, out of Rs. 1114.68 lacs, Rs. 834.22 lacs already stood disallowed in the original assessment order. The balance amount represented actual write off which was palpably clear from page 2 of the impugned order itself. No deduction on account of any such provision was, therefore, allowed to the assessee. Hence, there is no error or prejudice to the interest of revenue. As regards second issue it was noted that interest rate swap was an actual loss and only the net loss of Rs. 114.05 lacs after setting of gain of interest rate swap was claimed as deduction. However, we find that both these issues were duly examined by the AO vide Questionnaire dated 2.11.2004 (Page 1-2 of the Paper Book) to which replies dated 9.12.2004, 20.12.2004 and 6.1.2005 (Page No. 3-39 of Paper Book-1) were furnished and, therefore, the finding of the Ld. CIT that the issues were not examined properly was not correct. Even the Ld. CIT has not pointed out the definite and specific error in the original assessment order and observed that the inquiry made by the AO was inadequate or improper without first pointing out the error in the original assessment order passed by the AO, particularly because both the aforesaid issues were duly examined at the stage of the original assessment proceedings, hence, the impugned order is beyond jurisdiction, bad in law and void-ab-initio.
29. It is discernible from the aforenoted findings of the ITAT that both the claims were duly examined during the original assessment proceedings itself and neither there was any error nor the same was prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue. Thus, the findings of fact arrived at by the ITAT do not warrant any interference of this Court.
30. So far as the reliance placed by the CIT on Umashankar Rice Mill is concerned, the same is misplaced, particularly in light of the insertion of Explanation 2 to Section 263 of the Act, brought in place by the Finance Act, 2015. The said amendment markedly specifies various conditions to exercise the authority vested in the Commissioner under Section 263 of the Act, leaving no ambiguity in the interpretation of the said provision.
31. In view of the aforesaid, the appeal preferred by the Revenue is dismissed alongwith the pending application(s), if any.

SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J.  
 
PRELUDE  
1. The journey of adjudication of this case presented many 
challenges as the learned counsel for petitioner drew this Court‘s 
attention to the most ancient scriptures of various faiths and his point 
of view regarding the concept of pardanashin  woman in the sa id 
scriptures, at the same time, praying for the application of the old 
concept of pardanashin  women to the modern age empowered and 
educated woman.  
2. Thus, the challenge before this Court was to adjudicate and 
return a finding as to whether the concept of pardanashin  woman, as 
argued and enumerated by the learned counsel for petitioner, indeed 
means and refers to women who by mere virtue of their gender need 
to be extended special treatment, as according to the learned counsel, 
even today many women are pardanashin  out of their own choice or 
due to them following their respective religious practices.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 4 of 64 
 
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner prayed that guidelines be 
issued in the background of religious scriptures and Article 21 and 25 
of the Constitution of In dia, however, giving a new meaning, a new 
philosophy and evolving new jurisprudence based on old scriptures to 
suit the present day requirements of the community.  
4. As this Court writes this judgment, it notes that writ 
jurisdiction and adjudication of the i ssues therein do not stop 
springing surprises and challenges which become the harbinger of 
churning out philosophy and jurisprudence on a subject which 
involves referring to old scriptures, interpreting it in context of a 
particular case, yet confining its elf within constitutional morality and 
framework of criminal jurisprudence.  
5. The present case also raised an issue which initially confined 
itself to a particular person. However, in the final hearing, the person 
oriented prayers were satisfied and withdra wn on behalf of the 
petitioner but insistence was laid on adjudication of an issue brought 
forth by the present case for the larger societal interest, thus, bringing 
to the fore the power of Court to serve the community better by 
bringing about changes in the administration of criminal justice by 
issuance of directions wherever called for qua the concerned 
authorities.

FACTUAL BACKDROP  
7. Briefly summarised, the facts of the case, as disclosed from 
Status Report, are that on 05.11.2023, at about 10:00 am, at least six 
different PCR calls were received at P.S. Chandni Mahal , Delhi 
regarding a quarrel taking place at Rakab Ganj, behind Delite 
Cinema, Delhi. When the police had reached the spot, it was revealed 
that one Mohd. Tahir and his nephew Mohd. Anas had been assaulted 
by Mohd. Rehan, Mohd. Irfan and Mohd. Gayasuddin al ongwith 
some unknown persons and the victims had been taken to LNJP 
Hospital for treatment. When the police team had reached the 
hospital, they were informed that the injured Mohd. Anas was under 
treatment and was unfit to give a statement. In the meantime , accused 
Mohd. Rehan and Gayasuddin had also reached the same hospital for 
treatment. On the same night, at about 1:00 AM, accused Mohd. 
Rehan had fled from the hospital and thereafter, at about 1:30 AM, an 
information was received at P.S. Chandni Mahal t hat accused Mohd. 
Rehan accompanied by some other persons had attempted to brutally 
murder the victim Mohd. Anas by inflicting serious injuries with a 
surgical blade, who was undergoing treatment at the surgery 
department on the fourth floor of the hospita l.  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 8 of 64 
 
8. Due to the aforesaid acts of the accused persons, there was 
grave apprehension of threat to the life of Mohd. Tahir i.e. the 
complainant and his other family members, and accordingly, the 
police had started patrolling in the area and had stationed thems elves 
outside the house of complainant as well as the accused. The present 
petitioner is the sister of accused persons namely Mohd. Rehan, 
Mohd. Irfan and Mohd. Gayasuddin. It is submitted in the Status 
Report that when the police had reached the house of petitioner, it 
was found locked, but the lights of the house were switched on and 
the petitioner was peeping from her balcony, watching the activities 
in the street, unveiled. Thereafter, the police officials had enquired 
from her about her brothers, but s he had denied having any 
knowledge of their whereabouts. She had even told that she did not 
have the keys of the house to let police search the same. It is the case 
of State that, throughout these conversations, the petitioner stood 
there without any veil,  and it was the petitioner herself who later had 
requested the police officials to take her to police station as she 
feared any possible retaliation from the side persons who had been 
allegedly injured by the brothers of the petitioner.  
9. Conversely, the pet itioner alleges that the police had entered 
her house, though she is a pardanashin  woman, and had taken her to 
the police station, dragging her from her house to the police station, 
and not giving her time to wear pardah , knowing fully well that she 
is a pardanashin  woman and thus, the action of the police exceeded 
its authority by not allowing the petitioner to wear a veil.  
10. In a complaint written to the Commissioner of Police, Delhi,  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 9 of 64 
 
the petitioner alleged that during the intervening night of 05 -
06.11.202 3, at around 03:00 AM, she had found herself confronted 
by a group of police officials from P.S. Chandni Mahal who had 
allegedly engaged in high -handed, illegal, and contemptuous 
behaviour. Despite her repeated assertion that her brothers were not 
present within the premises, the officers had attempted to forcefully 
gain entry in her house. Thereafter, despite her repeated assurances 
that the individuals they were looking for i.e. Rehan and Irfan were 
not present in the house, the police officials, without waiting any 
further, had forcibly entered her house and had started carrying out a 
search of her residence. While searching the house, the police 
officials had not found anyone, and then, they had forcefully dragged 
the petitioner out of her house.  
11. Thus, the main grievance of the petitioner, which has also 
resulted in filing of the present petition, is that the petitioner is a 
pardanashin  woman, and she was not wearing her pardah  when she 
was moved out of her house. It is alleged that the petitioner was th en 
taken to the police station and was wrongfully confined there. It has 
also been alleged that prior to her release, she was subjected to 
threats and intimidation, warning her against pursuing any formal 
complaint regarding the incident, however, no relie f or action was 
forthcoming, resulting in filing of the present petition.  
12. The police, on the other hand, termed the complaint and the 
present writ petition filed before this Court as an afterthought and 
misconceived, in order to divert attention from the h einous acts 
committed by her brothers. It is also averred that the CCTV footage  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 10 of 64 
 
placed on record would clarify that the allegations against the police 
officers are false and fabricated.

the CCTV footage of all the cameras installed in the vicinity of P.S.

petitioner herein about the outcome of the same, 
within two months from today.‖  
 
15. However, learned counsel for the petitioner had prayed for  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 11 of 64 
 
passing of detailed order as far as clause (f) of the prayer is 
concerned , and this Court had reserved the judgment qua prayer 
clause (f).  
 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER  
16. Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that the petitioner 
herein is a pardanashin  Muslim woman, and she has a fundamental 
right to wear pardah  which is the Islamic dress code for women, 
which not only consists of a scarf that covers the head, the neck and 
bosom, but it also includes the overall dress that should be long and 
loose. It is argued that the petitioner, being a Muslim woman, is well 
within her rights to conduct herself in accordance with the tenets of 
her religion, including her choice of dress, as protected by Article  25 
of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to profess, 
practice, and propagate religion. This extend s to matters of personal 
liberty under Article 21, encompassing the right to live with dignity 
and make choices aligned with individual autonomy. Additionally, 
the constitutional safeguard provided by Article 29, which protects 
the interests of minorities,  further reinforces the right to preserve 
distinctive cultural practices, potentially including religious attire.  
17. It is further argued that the Article 25 of the Constitution, 
which is a fundamental right, does not come in the way of police in 
the dischar ge of their statutory duties or infringes or encroaches upon 
the rights of other citizens. It does not fall within reasonable 
restrictions as imposed on every citizen by the Constitution as it 
neither affects public order, morality and health nor other pro visions  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 12 of 64 
 
of the Constitution.  
18. It is prayed that it is not just desired but also the need of the 
hour to sensitise the Delhi Police qua fostering understanding and 
respect for women who observe pardah  either as a religious belief or 
as a part of their perso nal choice belonging to any religion. It is 
submitted that in a diverse and multicultural society like India, it is 
imperative that law enforcement agencies understand and respect the 
cultural practices of various communities, particularly those 
pertaining  to women observing pardah . Pardah , representing a 
practice deeply rooted in modesty and privacy, requires a nuanced 
and sensitive approach from the police to ensure the protection of 
women's rights while upholding law and order. Thus, with a view to 
sensi tise the Delhi police, the following quintessential aspects may be 
considered, which are as follows:  
(i) Understanding pardah  practices signifying commitment to 
modesty, dignity and privacy by the police and ensure that they 
respect the choice of women adhering to this tradition.  
(ii) The Delhi Police be sensitised about the constitutional 
guarantees and Indian Laws, guaranteein g freedom of religion 
and observing pardah by women being one of such 
constitutional guarantees to practice religion.  
(iii) Delhi Police being sensitised and trained by cultural 
experts, community leaders and women from different 
backgrounds for formulatin g and preparation of training 
modules which should cover significance of pardah and its 
various manifestations across communities.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 13 of 64 
 
(iv) Delhi Police be trained with effective communication 
strategies.  
(v)  Delhi Police be trained about community, policing and 
building trust.  
(vi)  Delhi Police be trained to handle situations by ensuring 
women are treated with dignity during investigations and 
interactions.  
(vii) Special provisions be made to accommodate pardah  
practices particularly in context of identity v erification or 
witness statements.  
(viii) Monitoring mechanism to evaluate such sensitization 
programmes.  
19. While explaining pardah  practices, it is argued that  Pardah  is 
a cultural and religious tradition followed by many women across 
different communities transcending religious boundaries in India. 
Often associated with veiling and seclusion, it signifies a 
commitment to modesty, dignity, and privacy. The police force , as 
the frontline enforcers of law and order, must familiarise themselves 
with the cultural nuances surrounding pardah  to ensure respectful 
and effective interactions with women adhering to this tradition. It is 
argued that Indian laws, including constitu tional guarantees of 
freedom of religion and protection of women's rights, form the 
foundation for a balanced approach. The police need to be aware of 
these legal safeguards while discharging their duties. Respecting 
religious freedom, gender equality, and  the right to privacy are 
crucial elements that should guide police interactions with women  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 14 of 64 
 
observing pardah . 
20. It is argued that sensitising the police forces involves 
comprehensive training initiatives that instil cultural awareness and 
understanding. Trai ning modules should cover the significance of 
pardah , its various manifestations across communities, and the legal 
protections in place for women practising it. Interactive sessions with 
cultural experts, community leaders, and women from different 
backgro unds can enhance the police force's sensitivity. It is argued 
that effective communication lies at the heart of building positive 
police -community relations. Officers should be trained to 
communicate respectfully and courteously with women observing 
purdah , taking into account the cultural and religious sensitivities 
involved. Clear guidelines on communication, avoiding unnecessary 
intrusion into personal spaces, and providing women with a 
comfortable environment for interaction should be emphasised.  
Argument regarding practice of Pardah existing in all religions and 
followed by women of all religions  
21. It is further argued that the practice of pardah  among women 
in India exists in different forms of „Ghunghat‟, „Pallu‟, „Dupatta‟, 
„Burqa‟, „Hijab‟  and s o on. Covering the head has religious 
significance, particularly for women since time immemorial.  
22. In Sikhism, for instance, the turban, an article of faith, 
distinguishes Sikhs from the others. Sikh women who have 
traditionally worn headscarves (chuni)  are now wearing turbans, 
much like Sikh men.  
23. It is further submitted that many Hindu women wear the  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 15 of 64 
 
Ghoonghat or the Ghungta , which emanates from the Sanskrit word, 
Avagunthana in India. There is a wide vocabulary of words for 
Avagunthana in the earliest fo rms of Sanskrit. Avagunthana was a 
cloak -like covering of the upper part of body, Uttariya was a 
covering till the shoulders, Adhikantha Pata was a covering till the 
neck and Sirovastra was a covering simply for the head.  
24. It is further mentioned that pard ah was prevalent even 
during Valmiki‟s Ramayana. The practice, which signifies 
―seclusion of women,‖ ―had assumed the form of a recognized social 
custom.‖ When Sita sets out with her husband to the forest, 
Valmiki expresses regret that, “a lady, who had so  far not been 
seen even by the spirits of the sky, should now become an object 
of public gaze.”  
25. Apart from the Ramayana, the head covering or a veil finds a 
mention in many Sanskrit plays . For instance, Sudraka, the author of 
Mrichhakatika , mentions that women wore Avagunthana, a thin veil, 
to hide their beauty and to enhance their coiffures. Similarly, ancient 
Indian plays –Kalidasa‘s Abhijnana Sakuntalam , Bhasa‘s 
Pratimanataka, Sisupalavadha, Dashakumaracharita, etc. , among 
others indicate  that women wore veils to cover their heads.  
Argument regarding women wearing pardah/ghoonghat in modern 
India  
26. It is also submitted that even today, in modern India , one 
finds Hindu women covered by the Ghoonghat. However, Hijab , 
which is a traditional sc arf worn by Muslim women to cover the hair 
and neck and sometimes the face, is different from Burqa , which is a  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 16 of 64 
 
tip to toe gown covering the entire body. Both, however, are types of 
veils worn by some Muslim women. Burqa  is a word that loosely 
falls under the category of pardah  or veil. It is stated that ‗ Pardah‟  is 
a Persian word translated as curtain, veil, attire worn by women to 
mark their social and physical segregation from the rest of society by 
covering their bodies and/or faces. Pardah  takes differ ent dimensions 
depending on the country, place of origin and hence has numerous 
variations.  
27. In the aforesaid background, it is argued that Delhi police 
officials are highly insensitive and apathetic towards sacrosanct 
religious and social practices and customs followed by women who 
observe pardah  either as a religious belief or as a part. It is f urther 
argued that cogitating the disconcerting facts of the present case, it 
appears that the Police Officials of Delhi Police are completely 
insensitive and apathetic towards the observance of sacrosanct 
religious and social practices and customs followe d by all the women 
who observe pardah  either as a religious belief or as a part of their 
personal choice belonging to any religion, which are guaranteed 
under Article 21 of the Constitution.  
 
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF STATE  
28. Learned ASC for the State argues that the facts as presented by 
the petitioner are false and fabricated, and the law enforcement 
agencies had followed the due process of law. It is further argued that 
though the petitioner says that she is a pardanashin  woman, she was 
standing in her balcony on the day of incident and looking down the  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 17 of 64 
 
street, without wearing any veil.  
29. As regards the grant of prayer (f) i.e. for issuance of directions 
to police, for their sensitization, it is submitted by learned ASC that 
there is no such requirement for an extra layer of procedure to be 
followed by the law enforcement agencies, as it will create a barrier 
to fair investigation, search procedures, and arrest, when it is 
required. It is submitted that there exists enough safe guards in law to 
protect the dignity of every individual, including an accused.  
30. It is also argued that there is no concept of pardah  or 
pardanashin  in most religions as suggested by the learned counsel for 
the petitioner and therefore, the relief sought b y the petitioner, in the 
form of issuance of directions qua sensitization of police officers, 
must be not granted.  
 
REPORT OF AMICUS CURIAE  
31. This Court, while reserving this judgment on 30.01.2024, had 
also passed an order appointing Smt. Manisha Agrawal Na rain, 
Advocate as Amicus Curiae  in this case to assist the Court on the 
issues raised on behalf of the petitioner, as far as prayer clause (f) is 
concerned.  
32. Report dated 22.02.2024 has been filed by Smt. Manisha 
Agrawal Narain, learned Amicus Curiae. The report begins by 
summarising that the petitioner has stated that she is a pardanashin  
Muslim woman who wears burqa ; and is seeking sensitization of 
police regarding the sacrosanct practices of pardah  observed by 
women either as per religion or as per choic e. The petition seeks to  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 18 of 64 
 
sensitise police about the sacrosanct religious, social customs and 
practices observed by all women who observe pardah  either as a 
religious belief or as a part of their personal choice.  
33. In the above context, it is submitted by lea rned Amicus that 
there has been  an ongoing global debate about the privacy of a 
pardanashin  woman on one hand, and the necessity of 
recognizability and identification of people for the ends of public 
order and security concerns on the other hand. While 
Burqa /Veil/ Pardah  may be worn by well -meaning women, but the 
same can be misused by the offenders of law to disguise themselves. 
It is submitted that anything which empowers a person to hide her/his 
identity may come in the way of efficient investigation, thus affecting 
public order.  
34. It is further submitted that veiling the face or covering the 
whole body practically veils the identity and recognizability of a 
person. However , identification of persons is critical to investigation 
done by the police. Asser tion of remaining inside Burqa /Veil/ Pardah  
may lead to promotion of anonymity in public; and can be 
counterproductive to the investigation.  
35. Another  issue, as flagged by learned Amicus, is whether the 
veil is sacrosanct essential religious practice of the various 
communities in India. It is submitted that in Commissioner of Police 
v. Acharya Jagadishwarananda Avadhuta (2004) 12 SCC 770 , 
Hon‘ble Apex C ourt held that essential part of a religion means the 
core beliefs upon which a religion is founded. The test to determine 
whether a part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 19 of 64 
 
whether the nature of the religion would be changed without that  part 
or practise, and if it be so, then such part could be treated as an 
essential or integral part of the religion. Some other decisions such as 
Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj Etc. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors 
AIR 1963 SC 1638 , A.S. Narayana Deekshitul u v. State of A.P.  
(1996) 9 SCC 548 , etc. are also relied upon by the learned Amicus in 
this regard, and it is submitted that on the basis of these tests, Courts 
have held various practices like triple talaq, cow -sacrifice, Tandav 
dance, etc. to be not con stituting the essential  parts of religion.  
36. It is then submitted that in Ancient Hindu texts, it is seen that 
pardah  was not an essential religious practice. In this regard, 
reference is made to excerpts from the Sundarkand , Brihadaranyaka  
Upanishad , etc.  
37. It is also submitted that taking into consideration the five 
duties laid down for the Muslims by the Prophet and the five 
‗Hukum‘ of Allah in Shariat, as per Mulla‘s Mohammedan  Law, 5th 
edition, 2019, it will be difficult to hold that wearing of 
Burqa /Veil/ Pardah  is such a mandatory practise which must be 
followed in order to remain in Islam. It is stated that many countries, 
including Islamic  countries across the globe, have already banned the 
burqah /pardah /veil.  
38. Learned Amicus submits that Article 21  of the Constitution 
encompasses right to privacy, but whether there is a fundamental 
right to remain unrecognised or anonymous, is a relevant question 
here. In this regard, it is submitted that enforcement of law and  
investigation of offences require eff ective identification and  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 20 of 64 
 
recognis ability of  persons. However, this would not mean that 
pardanashin  women should not be treated with decency, and rather, 
like every other human being, pardanashin  women also have a 
fundamental right to be treated with dign ity and decency. However, 
right to wear Pardah /Burqa /Veil cannot take away the rights of 
investigating agencies and if required, the police is well within its 
rights to identify the face of the pardanashin  person. In doing so, the 
police needs to follow th e same dignified behaviour with  
pardanashin  women as is required for all other women (which 
includes presence of lady member in police team, if a woman is to be 
searched).  
 
ISSUES AT THE CORE  
39. The petitioner had approached this Court seeking various 
reliefs, yet one common thread  among her pleas is the call for greater 
sensitivity  towards the needs of ‗ Pardanashin women‘ by law 
enforcement agencies and that in case the relief sought for is not 
granted, the existing approach and protocol of criminal investigation 
qua women in Delhi will be in violation of Article 21 and 25 of the 
Constitution of India.  Thus, the issues for consideration before this 
Court are:  
 
I. Whether the religions mentioned b y the 
petitioner, i.e. Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, 
Jainism,  Christianity, mandate wearing of 
pardah, veil, ghoonghat, and any alleged 
restriction or grant of non -opportunity to wear  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 21 of 64 
 
pardah during any stage of investigation will 
amount to violation of Articl e 25 of the 
Constitution of India?  
II.  Whether women, who choose to wear veil, 
ought to be afforded  specific safeguards, 
entailing that law enforcement agencies 
guarantee sufficient time and priva cy for them 
to properly wear their veils?  
III.  Whether th is Court should issue directions 
for sensitization of officers of Delhi Police 
apropos religious, social  and customary 
practices observed by pardanashin women?  
 
WHO IS A PARDANASHIN WOMAN  
Meaning in Strict Legal Connotation of the Term  
40. Pardanashin  women, steeped in tradition and seclusion, 
embody a cultural practice deeply rooted in history. This term refers 
to women who adhere to strict rules of seclusion, often shielding 
themselves from the outside world behind veils or screens. 
Throughout histor y, various legal systems and traditions have 
established special provisions to safeguard the interests and preserve 
the dignity of pardanashin  women in various facets of life, including 
contractual matters.  
41. The history of pardanashin  women traces back to t he adoption 
of pardah , a practice originating from Persian customs. Initially 
embraced by Muslim communities influenced by Persian culture,  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 22 of 64 
 
pardah  gradually permeated Northern India during the reign of the 
Mughal Empire. Under Mughal rule, Hindu upper -class women also 
embraced the practice, while women from lower socioe -conomic 
strata, tasked with managing households and engaging in agricultural 
work, did not adhere to it as rigorously. During the colonial era under 
British rule, the practice of pardah  gained widespread acceptance and 
was enforced with greater stringency. However, in modern times, its 
prevalence has declined, coinciding with a shift towards greater 
openness and independence among women, as well as matter of 
choice. Despite these changes, the  legal protections afforded to 
pardanashin  women remain significant, rooted in principles of equity 
and conscience.  
42. The vulnerability of pardanashin  women to exploitation and 
undue influence is a salient concern addressed by legal safeguards. 
Given their l imited exposure to external influences and the potential 
for manipulation, it is critical to afford these women enhanced 
protections under the law. The presumption of undue influence 
underlines the importance of ensuring that decisions made by 
pardanashin  women are free from coercion or external pressures, 
thereby safeguarding their rights and preserving their autonomy.  
43. While societal norms may evolve over time, the duty to 
safeguard the rights and dignity of all individuals remains steadfast. 
Through legal  protections rooted in principles of equity and 
conscience, pardanashin  women are afforded the necessary 
safeguards to navigate a changing world while preserving their 
cultural identity and autonomy.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 23 of 64 
 
Judicial Precedents defining ‘Pardanashin Woman’  
44. The Hon ‘ble Apex Court in case of Mst. Kharbuja Kuer v. 
Jangbahadur Rai  (1963) 1 SCR 456 , while discussing the concept of 
„pardanashin‟  women, referred to the decision authored by five 
Judge -bench of Privy Council in case of Farid -Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar 
Ahmad  1925 SC C OnLine PC 44 , and observed as under:  
―5. …In India pardahnashin ladies have been given a 
special protection in view of the social conditions of the 
times; they are presumed to have an Imperfect knowledge 
of the world, as, by the pardah  system they are practically 
excluded from social intercourse and communion with the 
outside world.  In Farid -Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar Ahmad  Lord 
Sumner traces the origin of the custom and states the principle 
on which the presumption is based. The learned Lord o bserved:  
""In this it has only given the special development, 
which Indian social usages make necessary, to the 
general rules of English law, which protect persons, 
whose disabilities make them dependent upon or 
subject them to the influence of others, even  though 
nothing in the nature of deception or coercion may have 
occurred. This is part of the law relating to personal 
capacity to make binding transfers or settlements of 
property of any kind.""  
The learned Lord also points out:  
""Of course fraud, duress an d actual undue influence are 
separate matters.""  
It is, therefore, manifest that the rule evolved for the protection 
of pardahnashin ladies shall not be confused with other 
doctrines, such as, fraud, duress and actual undue influence, 
which apply to all per sons whether they be pardahnashin ladies 
or not.‖

45. In case of Smt. Andhi Kuer v. Rajeshwar Singh 1972 SCC  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 24 of 64 
 
OnLine Pat 78 , the High Court of Patna expressed as under:  
―..The expression “Pardanashin ” has not to be confused 
with a lady observing parda. A lady observing parda may 
not be a pardanashin lady in the legal sense of the term.  
The term ―pardanashin lady‖ is not a term of art. It has special 
legal significance as one who is unable to understan d the 
transaction by virtue of the manner in which she has been 
brought up…‖  
(Emphasis supplied)  
 
46. In the case of Fayyaz -Ud-Din v. Kutab -Ud-Din 1928 SCC 
OnLine Lah 554 , the Lahore Bench had held that a woman belonging 
to a family of barbers, keeping a hamam  in the town of Delhi, whose 
females did not live in a state of seclusion, is not pardanashin . 
47. The High Court of Madras, in case of Chidambaram Pillai v. 
Muthammal 1992 SCC OnLine Mad 306 , had discussed the judicial 
precedents on the issue of pardanas hin women and had expressed as 
under:  
15. A section of womenfolk in view of the social conditions of 
the limes are presumed to have imperfect knowledge of the 
world, as the Supreme Court has said in the case of Mst. 
Kharbuja Kher AIR 1963 S.C. 1203 . They a re presumed to 
have imperfect knowledge of the world, as, by the pardah 
system, they are practically excluded from social intercourse 
and communion with the outside world. The origin is traced to 
the Indian social usages and the general rules of English La w 
which protect persons whose disabilities make them dependent 
upon or subject them to the influence of others, even though 
nothing in the nature of deception or coercion may have 
occurred, applicable to such section of women…  
16. The pardah  system as understood by the courts in India is 
not the system of keeping a woman under veil indoors in 
zenana, but in seclusion, away from the knowledge of the 
world, in the sense that they are not ordinarily allowed to 
interact with the male folk and are  kept away from social 
intercourse and communion with the outside world. The view  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 25 of 64 
 
of the Lahore Court in the case of Favvar -ud-din v. Kutab -ud-
Din had almost worked as an alarm for the courts to develop a 
sense that any strict meaning to parda  was going to exclude a 
greatly deprived section of the society from the protection 
cloak of the law, namely, the illiterate women and other 
women having such infirmities that they practically live 
without any social intercourse and communion with the outs ide 
world. The judicial consensus, as we have already noticed, has 
been expressed thus: - 
""The rules regarding transaction by the Pardanashin 
apply equally to illiterate women though they may not 
be in a strict sense Pardanashin,""  
A Pardanashin may not be i lliterate, but she still may be 
ignorant in the sense that she has an imperfect knowledge of 
the world, and she is practically excluded from social 
Intercourse and communion with the outside world. Her 
ignorance is the curse of a social usage that womenfol k depend 
upon malefolk for transaction of their business with the outside 
world. Thus, not all women, but only those those who are 
practically excluded from social intercourse and 
communion with the outside world fall in this category.  If it 
is for this re ason that they are taken as persons suffering from 
disabilities which make them dependent upon or subject to the 
influence of others, the illiterate women who, for the reason of 
social compulsion are required to move out to work in the 
fields and elsewhere  for livelihood, cannot be said to be less 
disabled and deprived. Even if they are intelligent to know 
where to go and how to earn their livelihood, yet they cannot 
read anything nor write anything, and unless told about the 
contents by others, will not kn ow what the document contains. 
To the extent the character, content and the effect of the 
document are concerned, she has to be presumed to be ignorant 
by sheer illiteracy, the curse which is still pervading the ancient 
society particularly the women livin g in this part of the 
country, a fact about which, we think, we are competent to take 
judicial notice. We find ourselves in complete agreement with 
the view that the special cloak of protection applied to 
Pardanashin women has to be applied to illiterate w omen as 
well.‖

The Changing Meaning and Notions of the Concept of 
‘Pardanashin Woman’  
48. The changing meaning and notions of the concept of 
„pardanashin‟  and its relevance in the present times was discussed by 
the Division Bench of High Court of Gauhati in Mustt. Jubeda 
Khatun v. Sulaiman Khan 1985 SCC OnLine Gau 15 . The relevant 
observations are as under:  
―5. A pardanashin lady, in its legal meaning is a woman of 
the rank who lives in seclusion , shut in the zenana, having no 
communication except from behind the pardah or screen with 
any person save a few near relations. A pardanashin woman 
need not necessarily be a woman of rank. If on account of the 
rules  and customs of society she has to keep herself within the 
zenana and to lead a life of seclusion without any contact with 
the outside world, she is a Pardahnashin woman.  
However, this old notion has now been taken a notable 
change along with the age and the circumstances surrounding 
the society at large. The present society has been advanced 
to a new dimension in its educational; cultural and social 
atmosphere. A large number of women folk either Hindu, 
Muslim or Christian are now h olding a responsible job in all 
spheres of avocation. In the present trend of the society only 
those who are residing in interior places and governed by strict 
custom prevailing in the society are confined under Pardah.  
***  
7. WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE PRESENT DAY URBAN 
PARDANASHIN LADIES? DO THEY STAND IN THE SAME 
POSITION WITH THOSE OF PARDANASHINS ? 
All town -bred ladies, in parda  or not, know that physician 
should be called when there is illness in the house. Almost all 
know that when a legal document is to be executed lawyer 
should be consulted. There may be quasi pardanashin ladies in 
urban areas but all of them know the necessi ty of taking 
lawyer‘s aid in transacting documents. The position is 
changing fast and as such the application of the principle 
should be confined to real pardanashin ladies who are really  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 27 of 64 
 
ignorant, infirm and illiterate living in seclusion behind the 
parda . I am, therefore, of the opinion that principles 
enunciated should be applied to all pardanashin  who men who 
are really pardanashin…‖  
(Emphasis supplied)  
 
49. Thus, in the legal connotation of the term , a woman qualifies 
as pardanashin  when she leads a life of complete seclusion, 
detached from the broader societal interactions and experiences . 
The premise underlying the legal protection afforded to pardanashin  
women is the recognition that their seclusion renders them vulnerable 
to exploitation and injustice. By extending special safeguards, the law 
seeks to mitigate the risks associated with their seclusion and ensure 
that their rights and interests are upheld . 
 
PARDANASHIN WOMAN: EXAMINING THE MEANING IN 
THE CONTEXT OF PETITIONER’S USAGE  
50. In the contents of petition, it has been mentioned that petitioner 
is a pardanashin  woman and during the arguments before this Court, 
learned counsel for the petitioner had contended that even in modern 
India, a large number of women still practice pardah  in different 
religions and are therefore pardanashin  women. Therefore, they 
should be considered as a special category, who should be treated 
with dignity and sensitivity by the police force while investigating 
any criminal case.  
51. The use of word „pardanashin‟  by the learned counsel for the 
petitioner was in context of women who observe pardah or veil, and  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 28 of 64 
 
thus, being specifically entitled to protection by this Court by 
issuance of directions to Delhi Police to sensitise them as to how they 
should deal with such women who observe pardah . This necessitated 
this Court to go into the meaning  of pardanashin  women.  
52. The petitioner has employed the term pardanashin  
interchangeably with burqa, ghoonghat, pallu, etc. and as indicative 
of someone under a veil. While the petitioner may equate 
pardanashin  with individuals under a veil, such as women w earing 
burqas , it is essential to recognize the difference between the two.  
53. In legal parlance, pardanashin  woman would refer to those 
who are entirely secluded from the wider societal sphere or lack a 
comprehensive understanding of societal norms and reaso ning. This 
strict interpretation is crucial for determining the applicability of 
special legal protections afforded to those classified as pardanashin . 
Such protections are designed to safeguard individuals who, due to 
their seclusion or lack of understand ing, may be vulnerable to 
exploitation or undue influence.  
54. While the petitioner may use the term pardanashin  to denote a 
woman under a veil, this does not align with the legal meaning, 
which requires complete seclusion or a lack of societal 
understanding. The petitioner‘s usage of the term pardanashin  would 
include a woman wearing a veil, despite not being living in seclusion 
or despite possessing sufficient knowledge and understanding of 
societal norms.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 29 of 64 
 
History Behind the Veil: Understanding Pardah in Vari ous 
Cultures  
55. The petitioner has broadened the interpretation of „parda‟  to 
embrace a multicultural perspective, encompassing women from 
various cultural backgrounds and customs.  
Hinduism  
56. An example of such a traditional custom given by the 
petitioner is ‗ ghoonghat ‘ (also called ghunghat, ghunghta, ghomta, 
orhni, odani, laaj, chunari, jhund, kundh ), a form of head covering 
predominantly worn by Hindu women, even in modern India. 
Reference is further made to Valmiki‘s Ramayana  to submit that 
Mata Sita  also u sed to practise pardah . It is further pleaded that many 
Sanskrit plays would reveal that Hindu women in ancient India used 
to cover their heads/face and hide their beauty.  
57. In this regard, this Court notes that presently, the practice of 
facial veiling amo ng Hindu women may be prevalent to some extent 
in some parts of India. However, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta  
or chunni , which the learned counsel for the petitioner has argued as 
a form of barrier signifying seclusion, is not correct, as in the moder n 
times, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta  or chunni  is viewed as a 
symbol of propriety and respect towards others, rather than being a 
symbol of barrier or seclusion. Thus, it cannot be equated or used as a 
synonym to the word ‗ pardanashin‟ .  
58. The learned  Amicus  through her report has also drawn this 
Court‘s attention towards Brihadaranyaka Upanishad , according to  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 30 of 64 
 
which King Janaka of Videha Kingdom had organised Rajasuya 
Yagna  and had invited all learned sages of India to participate. Hindu 
woman, such as  Gargi, a sage, who had participated in the debate, 
had won the same by defeating one of the most learned sages 
Yajnavalkya in front of many others. A woman saint, Maitreyi had 
also successfully debated with Yajnavalkya in open court. Thus, the 
women in Hi ndus, since time immemorial, were empowered.  
59. As regards the reference by the learned counsel for petitioner 
to Sanskrit plays authored by Sudraka or Kalisada, in order to bring 
home his point regarding the women practising pardah /veil in 
Hinduism in contex t with religion, the same is not meritorious since 
plays are stories which may refer to an attire but not mandate of the 
faith for a woman to follow. Moreover, it is mentioned in the petition 
itself that these plays would indicate that “women wore veils to  cover 
their heads” . There is no gainsaying that covering of head by women 
cannot be equated with covering the face by putting a veil or pardah  
and such women cannot be termed as pardanashin .   
60. As far as the reference of the learned counsel for the 
petitio ner to Mata Sita  (माता सीता), in context of Ramayana  (रामायण), 
is concerned, this Court observes that neither in the Ramayana  nor 
in any of the ancient or modern temples of Hindus, Mata Sita  has 
been projected or shown to be wearing a veil or a ghoonghat or 
pardah .  
61. This Court also holds that even the reference to the extract of 
Ramayana  by the learned counsel is in isolation without context, and 
the following extracts from the Ramcharitmanas (रामचररतमानस)  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 31 of 64 
 
would prove to the contrary:

W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 32 of 64

IV. 
 
 
 
 
V. 
 
 
 
62. The above extracts from Ramcharitmanas  adequately prove 
that Mata Sita did not wear a veil and therefore, even to refer to her 
as a pardanashin woman will amount to nothing but distortion of 
description of Mata Sita  in the religious texts. Further, the Ramayana  
does not project Mata Sita  as a weak woman and rather by shallow 
reading and without understanding the true meaning and concept of 
Ramayana , a person at times may feel so, as they would not have 
gone into the deeper depth and meaning of the concept of Mata Sita  
 
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 35 of 64 
 
as to who she was and under which maya  (माया), she took birth as a 
human for a larger purpose of destroying evil forces and thus 
becoming instrumental in destroying evil forces through Lord Rama 
(भगवान राम).  
63. The religious texts of Hindus are not mere books, but as 
Hinduism itself, are a way of life which prescribe a way of life to 
those who believe in it to follow it, in its spirit. Further, by following 
their dharma  (धमम) i.e. duty in different roles and relationships in the 
society, continue their journey to attain the goal of Moksha (मोक्ष) i.e. 
being one with the supreme power that the Hindus believe in. Even 
this goal is an individual choice, however, practising the dharma  
prescribed for every role  in one‘s life is desirable.  
Hinduism: Religion vs. Dharma  
64. Since the learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued 
and referred to the word „dharma‟ and the mandate of dharma to 
follow the practice of veil, ghunghat , pardah in the context of 
Hindui sm to bring home his point that even for a Hindu woman, to 
wear the same was, and to some extent even today is, a matter of 
dignity, mandate of religion and is intertwined with issue of right to 
practice religion and religious practices, has forced this Co urt to 
dwell into the question of difference between the word, ‗religion‘ and 
‗dharma‘ in Hinduism. Hinduism is Sanatan.  
65. There is a difference between religion and dharma  as 
understood in Hinduism. While practising a lifestyle, a profession 
and different i ndividual relationships etc., each person is practising  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 36 of 64 
 
his dharma  qua that relationship or profession or act. Thus, a 
different dharma is followed by each individual in his different roles 
whether professional or personal as understood in Hinduism. The 
word religion is different, thus, from dharma as understood in 
Hindu ism.  
66. To give an example, in Hinduism, the same person will be 
practising his dharma  as a son towards his parents, a different 
dharma  as a husband to his wife, and a different dharma  towards his 
children, siblings, society and nation.  
67. To give another exam ple, a Court of law/judge may have its 
faith as „X‟ being born in a family having full faith in „X‟ and 
following its tenets, however, the Court‟s dharma  as a Judge is to 
do justice to all individuals before it, irrespective of their faith, 
commonly known as religion or other considerations such as 
social or economic status in life which at no cost should waver. 
The Court‟s dharma  as a Judge is not faith „X‟ but doing equal 
justice to all .  
68. This Court, therefore, is of the considered opinion that 
Hinduism d oes not mandate pardah for women, as suggested by the 
learned counsel for the petitioner, as in ancient India, there are 
examples of empowered women in every profession and individual 
lives with rights, and the ancient scriptures, the deities and the Gods 
have never been projected as wearing pardah  or prescribing pardah  
to women as a mandatory practice religious or otherwise.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 37 of 64 
 
Sikhism  
69. As regards Sikhism, it has been mentioned in the petition that 
“in Sikhism, for instance, the turban, an article of faith, di stinguishes 
Sikhs from the others. Sikh women who have traditionally worn 
headscarves (chuni) are now wearing turbans, much like Sikh men.”  
70. In respect of the aforesaid, this Court notes that in Sikhism, it 
is customary for women to don a dupatta or chunni for the purpose of 
covering their head,  while visiting Gurdwaras, which symbolises 
reverence for sacred spaces. In fact, when inside a Gurdwara, every 
person is required to cover his or her head. Such practice of wearing 
a dupatta  or chunni  is common in Si khism, but without any formal 
imposition by their Gurus, signifying the absence of a concept of 
veiling within the religion. The headgears are worn by Sikh men, and 
not by Sikh women, barring a few circumstances, however, the 
petition mentions that Sikh wo men are “now wearing turbans much 
like Sikh men '' which  is not true. Further, there is no concept of any 
‗veil‘ or covering the face in Sikh customs and traditions, which 
could substantiate petitioner‘s argument of prevalence of pardah  
system among Sikh w omen.  
Christianity, Judaism, Jainism  
71. In the petition, only a few passing references have been made 
that many women belonging to Christianity, Judaism or Jainism are 
also pardanashin  as they wear some form of pardah  or veil, 
mandated by their religion. However, the same is unsubstantiated by 
any religious text, authentic proof or writing.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 38 of 64 
 
Islam  
72. The petition mentions that there is a difference between hijab  
and burqa , and burqa  is a word that loosely falls under the c ategory 
of pardah  or veil. It is stated that there are two verses in the Qur‘an 
in which Almighty Allah talks about the issue of decency and hijab, 
which deal with ‗ hijab  of eyes‘. Thereafter, it is mentioned that 
another verse talks about a woman conceali ng the head and then 
using the loose ends of the scarf to conceal the neck and the bosom. It 
is further stated that as per Quran, the Islamic dress code for women 
does not only consist of a scarf that covers the head, the neck and the 
bosom; it also includ es the overall dress that should be long and 
loose.  
73. Thus, as per petitioner, she is well -within  her rights to conduct 
herself in accordance with the tenets of her religion, including her 
choice of dress, as protected by Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.  
74. In this regard, this Court notes that the issue  regarding hijab  or 
burqa  being essential religious practices is an issue which is pending 
adjudication before the Hon'ble Apex Court. Background of the same 
is that the Three -Judge Bench of Karnataka High Court in case of 
Resham v. State of Karnataka 2022 SCC OnLine Kar 315  had h eld 
that hijab  is not an essential religious practice of Islam, and the same 
would not be covered under Article 25 of the Constitution of India. 
Thereafter, the Division Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in an appeal 
against the said judgment of Karnataka High C ourt, had delivered a 
split verdict in case of Aishat Shifa (Hijab Case -2 J.) v. State of 
Karnataka  (2023) 2 SCC 1 , which is now pending to be placed  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 39 of 64 
 
before a Three -Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court for 
adjudication. However, even though the issue has yet not been 
decided by the Hon‘ble Apex Court, the petitioner has repeatedly 
mentioned in the petition that the right to wear a pardah , which is 
like a burqa/hijab , would be covered under Article 25 of Constitution 
of India. Be that as it may, since the i ssue is already sub -judice 
before the Hon‟ble Apex Court, this Court would not delve 
deeper into it .  
 
POLICING IN BHARAT: MULTIFACETED DUTIES & 
SOCIAL CONTEXT  
75. Policing encompasses the multifaceted duties carried out by 
law enforcement agencies to maintain  public order, enforce laws, 
prevent and investigate crimes, and ensure the safety and security of 
individuals and communities. It involves a range of activities, 
including patrolling, responding to emergencies, conducting 
investigations, apprehending susp ects, and working collaboratively 
with the public to address concerns and build trust.  
76. In the context of the preamble of the Delhi Police Act, policing 
is viewed as a fundamental mechanism for upholding justice, 
safeguarding rights, and promoting harmony within the diverse 
population of Delhi. It emphasises the need for law enforcement to 
operate within the framework of democratic principles , respecting 
the rule of law and protecting the rights and freedoms of all citizens.  
77. It is crucial to recognize that policing is not tailored to 
serve the interests of any specific religious or any cultura l  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 40 of 64 
 
community alone. Rather, this Court holds that it has to be 
essentially guided by the principles of impartiality, fairness, and 
reasonability . While respecting cultural sensitivities and religious 
practices, law enforcement agencies must prioritise the c ommon good 
and uphold the law without discrimination.  
Test of Reasonability and Compelling Public Interest  
78. The test of reasonability serves as a guiding principle in 
determining the appropriate response of law enforcement in various 
situations. For instanc e, when dealing with individuals from diverse 
backgrounds, such as during arrests or interactions with suspects, the 
police must assess the circumstances and make decisions that are 
proportionate and justifiable. While accommodating reasonable 
requests, su ch as allowing suspects to wear basic clothing and 
ensuring their right to dignity as such is not violated, the police must 
balance individual rights with the need to maintain public safety and 
uphold the law.  
79. In the discharge of their duties, the investigating agency is 
required to navigate the delicate balance between upholding 
individual rights and safeguarding compelling public interests. While 
individual rights are supreme, they may need to yield to the 
imperatives of public safety and security when necessary. However, 
it is essential to underscore that such infringements cannot be 
arbitrary or disproportionate; they must be grounded in objective 
criteria and serve a legitimate public interest. Thus, while e xercising 
their powers, the police must adhere to the principle of  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 41 of 64 
 
reasonableness, ensuring that their actions are both necessary and 
justified within the confines of the law and respect for individual 
rights.  
Multi -cultural Land of Bharat & Policing  
80. The increasingly muti -cultural nature of Indian society 
definitely has an impact on policing  in Delhi or India. The complaint 
in the present case is about police officers, about their insensitivity in 
protecting the pardanashin women and not giving them enough  time 
to wear the pardah  as per their religion.  
81. The police as law enforcement authority has a vital duty of 
protecting the community from those who have no respect for law, 
who are in conflict with law, those who have no respect for rule of 
law and indulg e in criminal behaviour so as to endanger 
establishment of rule of law in the community. The Police acts as 
watchmen for the community by preventing crime and bringing 
criminals to the fold of the criminal justice system. The police have 
the role of crime control, maintenance of law and order, and also are 
available 24 hours for a wide range of services to the community.  
82. Needless to say, crime prevention and control is the most 
vital role they play and the general public holds the image of 
police as those who prevent crime, who detect and apprehend 
offenders and protect them . Since  the police personnel are crime 
fighters, the policing involves certain rights to them under Delhi 
Police Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure. While the success of 
policing dep ends largely on how the police personnel respond to their  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 42 of 64 
 
duties and to the community members, their treatment of the 
vulnerable while dealing with crime prevention measures, many a 
times comes under scrutiny.  
 
WHETHER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS 
SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN QUESTION?  
83. Since all the other prayers were disposed of in this petition, the 
Court is only dealing with issue of issuance of general directions to 
the police to sensitise the police force apropos  the sacrosanct 
religious , social customs and practices observed by all the women 
who observe pardah  either as a religious belief or as a part of their 
personal choice belonging to any religion, while keeping in mind the 
submissions made before in this Court that many women in diff erent 
parts of the country and the world are Pardanashin .  
Present Day Legal Framework for Protection of the Dignity of 
Women During Investigation of a Criminal Case  
84. Various substantive and procedural  laws in India have been 
designed to grant women certai n privileges and considerations. The 
provisions pertaining to search and arrest of women, under the Code 
of Criminal Procedure aims to ensure that dignity of every woman is 
protected, regardless of them even being an accused.  
Procedure of Arrest of a Woman  
85. Chapter V of Cr.P.C., spanning Sections 41 to 60A, delineates  
the procedures governing the arrest of individuals. These sections  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 43 of 64 
 
provide comprehensive guidance on the procedure to be followed at 
the time of arrest. While these provisions bestow considerab le 
authority upon the police for arresting individuals, they also impose 
reasonable limitations, particularly concerning the arrest of women. 
Law enforcement agencies are bound to adhere strictly to the 
stipulations outlined in this Chapter when affecting arrests, regardless 
of the circumstances.  
86. Section 46(4) of Cr.P.C., introduced by the Criminal 
Amendment  Act of 2005 through Section 6, lays down the 
fundamental procedures governing the arrest of women. It reads as 
under:  
―Save in exceptional circumstance s, no women shall be 
arrested after sunset and before sunrise, and where such 
exceptional circumstances exist, the woman police officer 
shall, by making a written report, obtain the prior 
permission of the Judicial Magistrate of the first class 
within whos e local jurisdiction the offence is committed or 
the arrest is to be made. ""  
 
87. According to this provision, the arrest of a woman must be 
carried out by a female police  officer. Moreover, it specifies that, 
ordinarily, no woman shall be arrested between sun set and sunrise. 
However, if the offence is serious or necessitates immediate action 
during this period, the female police officer must obtain permission 
from the Judicial Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the offence is 
committed or where the report is  to be lodged.  
Procedure for Search  
88. The search  of an arrested individual and his residence or  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 44 of 64 
 
dwelling is a crucial aspect of the arrest procedure. Sections 47 and 
51 of Cr.P.C. outlines the process for conducting such searches, with 
specific provisions ta ilored for women. The search conducted by the 
authorities  executing the arrest can be categorised into two main 
categories.  
(i) Search of Person  
89. According to Section 51 of Cr.P.C., when a police officer 
searches an arrested person, any seized items must be securely stored, 
and the individual must be provided with a receipt detailing the 
confiscated items. Section 51 provides as under:  
―51. Search of arrested person. —(1) Whenever a person is 
arrested by a police officer under a warrant which does not 
provide for the taking of bail, or under a warrant which 
provides for the taking of bail but the person arrested 
cannot furnish bail, and  
 
whenever a person is arrested without warrant, or by a 
private person under a warrant, and cannot lega lly be 
admitted to bail, or is unable to furnish bail,  
 
the officer making the arrest or, when the arrest is made by 
a private person, the police officer to whom he makes over 
the person arrested, may search such person, and place in 
safe custody all artic les, other than necessary wearing -
apparel, found upon him and where any article is seized 
from the arrested person, a receipt showing the articles 
taken in possession by the police officer shall be given to 
such person.  
 
(2) Whenever it is necessary to cau se a female to be 
searched, the search shall be made by another female with 
strict regard to decency.‖  
 
90. However, the procedure for searching an arrested woman 
involves considerations of morality. As per Section 51(2) of Cr.P.C., 
if it becomes necessary to conduct a search on a female, it must be  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 45 of 64 
 
conducted by another female, ensuring utmost decency and respect 
for the woman‘s dignity.  
(ii) Search of Place  
91. When a police officer or any other individual executes an 
arrest or a warrant of arrest , they are empowe red to search any 
premises for the subject of the arrest. The owner of such premises is 
obligated to grant unrestricted entry to the officer  and assist them in 
conducting the search to the fullest extent possible. Section 47 
provides as under:  
―47. Search of place entered by person sought to be 
arrested. —(1) If any person acting under warrant of arrest, 
or any police officer having authority to arrest, has reason 
to believe that the person to be arrested has entered into, or 
is within, any place, any person  residing in, or being in 
charge of, such place shall, on demand of such person 
acting as aforesaid or such police officer, allow him free 
ingress thereto, and afford all reasonable facilities for a 
search therein.  
 
(2) If ingress to such place cannot be o btained under sub -
section (1), it shall be lawful in any case for a person 
acting under a warrant and in any case in which a warrant 
may issue, but cannot be obtained without affording the 
person to be arrested an opportunity of escape, for a police 
office r to enter such place and search therein, and in order 
to effect an entrance into such place, to break open any 
outer or inner door or window of any house or place, 
whether that of the person to be arrested or of any other 
person, if after notification of his authority and purpose, 
and demand of admittance duly made, he cannot otherwise 
obtain admittance:  
 
Provided that, if any such place is an apartment in the 
actual occupancy of a female (not being the persons to 
be arrested) who, according to custom, doe s not appear 
in public, such person or police officer shall, before 
entering such apartment, give notice to such female 
that she is at liberty to withdraw and shall afford her  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 46 of 64 
 
every reasonable facility for withdrawing, and may 
then break open the apartment  and enter it.  
 
(3) Any police officer or other person authorised  to make 
an arrest may break open any outer or inner door or 
window of any house or place in order to liberate himself 
or any other person who, having lawfully entered for the 
purpose of making an arrest, is detained therein.‖  
 
92. However, the proviso to Sect ion 47(2) of the Cr.P.C. stipulates 
that if the police officer or any other individual executing the arrest 
warrant becomes aware that the premises to be searched is the 
primary residence of a  woman who, as per custom, does not appear in 
public, they must provide a notice to the woman informing her of her 
right to withdraw before commencing the search.  
Whether the Petitioner has made out a case, Necessitating Issuance 
of any Directions?  
93. The central point  in the present case essentially is whether 
this Court can identify any reason to take upon it, the role of an 
adjudicator to lay down directions to follow a certain protocol by 
sensitisation of the police force, which in the modern context and 
in the realm of practicality may not be legitim ate.  
94. Of course the Courts have to be responsive to any 
contingencies and how those contingencies and situations affect the 
community at large, but at the same time, they also have an equal 
responsibility to consider whether the existing law, procedural, 
substantive or otherwise, is sufficient to ensure equal and just 
treatment to all equally placed.  
95. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides for necessary  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 47 of 64 
 
safeguards as to how the police personnel are required to exhibit 
sensitivity towards the women, vide Section 46(4) and Section 60(A) 
of Cr.P.C. However, while investigating heinous crimes, to put fetters 
or roadblocks  in their way of ensuring swift response to 
apprehending an accused during search of a place or a person would 
rather result in the accused abs conding or the evidence being 
destroyed.  
96. In such situations , to burden the police, while carrying out 
investigation of a criminal case or apprehending accused wherein 
each minute is crucial, lest accused absconds or evidence is 
destroyed, will not only be  impractical but also a dangerous 
proposition. Issuance of an additional direction to first inquire 
from a woman as to whether she is a pardanashin woman or she 
wears any form of veil according to her religious belief or 
customary practices, and then to gr ant additional time and notice 
to wear pardah or veil, in addition to following the safeguards 
already provided in law, on the ground of exhibiting awareness 
and sensitivity of the police will be inviting an accused to misuse 
the directions and utilise the  time so gained, at times also on 
falsehood, to abscond or destroy evidence .  
97. To give a few examples, this Court frames the following 
illustrations:  
Illustrations  
(a)  Ms. ‘X’, a suspected terrorist is apprehended by law 
enforcement officers, and during the arrest, Ms. 'X' requests 
additional time to wear traditional clothing, citing religious 
or cultural reasons. It may not be considered reasonable by  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 48 of 64 
 
the authorities to  afford time to Ms. ‘X’ due to the potential 
security risks involved, as traditional clothing could be 
potentially used for concealing weapons or explosives, 
posing a threat to public safety, or the time so provided 
could also be used by Ms. 'X' to plan an d execute an attack 
on the police officials.  
 
(b)  Ms. ‘X’, who possesses digital evidence and is 
apprehended by law enforcement agencies, requests time to 
wear her religious attire. Granting Ms. ‘X’ additional time in 
a premises not fully controlled by police  officers can result 
in the destruction or distortion of digital evidence by Ms. 
‘X’, which can be destroyed in a matter of seconds or 
minutes.  
 
(c)  Mr. 'Y' is a suspect in a serious crime and law 
enforcement agencies arrive to conduct an investigation, 
Ms. 'X', a close relative of Mr. 'Y' present in the same house, 
requests time to wear religious attire. However, the 
authorities, mindful of the possibility that granting Ms. 'X' 
additional time could provide an opportunity for any 
communication or interference  with the investigation, 
hesitate to fulfil the request. This cautious approach by the 
authorities may be deemed reasonable given the 
circumstances of the investigation and the need to preserve 
its integrity.  
 
98. The fundamental requirement of some cases lies in the 
secrecy of conducting a raid to apprehend an accused or recover an 
object, currency, etc., and in case such a mandatory direction is 
issued, it can be misused to distort or destroy evidence and the very 
purpose of the raid will be defeated, compromising with the 
investigation of a case, causing serious prejudice to the investigating 
agency. In case, a case is based on cyber crime or retrieving or 
recovering of digital evidence, which can be lost at the click  of a 
button, such mandatory protocol to be followed can be misused by a  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 49 of 64 
 
woman accused or a male accused having a female member at home 
by projecting that she is a pardanashin woman, though in fact she 
may not be . 
99. While this Court maintains that sensitivit y towards cultural 
diversity and equipping police personnel with knowledge, skill and 
attitudes to deal with females will be of utmost importance, at the 
same time, directing the police to act in interest of a particular gender 
in a particular way, which m ay be opposed to the interest of society 
at large, will be unjust.  
100. Any legal restriction in their way of investigation will affect 
their effectiveness. The police have to ensure execution of law while 
respecting human dignity and right of a person, and balancing the 
same with the need for social order and safety of the co mmunity. The 
Courts and the society have to recognize  the legitimate authority of 
the police to implement and execute law while policing, though any 
excess committed by them in contravention of law will always be 
open to judicial scrutiny.  
101. In case any such  additional direction is issued, the police may 
find themselves not only entrusted with pressure of policing for 
enforcing  law and crime prevention, but they may also be under 
constant pressure to be more cautious and lose precious time while 
apprehending an accused, in order to appear to have a sensitive 
gender and community based approach.   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 50 of 64 
 
Argument regarding Right to Dignity under Article 21 vis -a-vis 
Pardanashin Women  
102. It is the case of petitioner that a woman‘s right to wear pardah  
is covered under the ambit of right to dignity, which is enshrined 
under Article 21 of the Constitution, besides Article 25 of the 
Constitution, which protects one‘s right to practise or profess his or 
her religion. Accordingly, the directions for sensiti zation of police 
officers qua pardanashin  women should also be issued since the 
officers by their conduct violate the right to dignity of women who 
are pardanashin . 
103. As far as this argument is concerned, this Court is of the 
opinion that the concept of dign ity also, as enshrined in Article 21 
of the Constitution, extends universally to every citizen, 
irrespective of gender or any other characteristic . It is a 
fundamental principle that is based on the inherent worth and value 
of each individual within societ y. Article 21 guarantees the protection 
of life and personal liberty, recognizing that dignity is a fundamental 
aspect of human existence. The protection under Article 21 is also 
not contingent upon adherence to any particular cultural or 
religious practic e, including the concept of pardah . Instead, it 
applies universally to all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or 
practices.  
104. Thus, every human, whether a man or a woman, is entitled 
to the right to dignity, which is also available even to an accused 
or a  prisoner.  Also to ensure that dignity of any woman is not 
compromised, special safeguards have been provided under law,  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 51 of 64 
 
which have already been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. To 
this extent, the law is clear and the police officers are bound by it  
and they must remain aware  of the provisions of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure as well as judicial precedents, which put 
certain measures in place for upholding the dignity of women, 
while either arresting or searching any woman or while carrying 
out the investigation. When the law talks about dignity of 
„women‟, it means all women, regardless of their religion, faith or 
custom.   
The Concept of Judgment Impact  
105. The concept of judgment impact  has also to remain one of 
the crucial ingredients and factors whil e writing a judgment since a 
mandatory direction to another authority may result into practical 
difficulties, and instead of helping in administration of justice and 
ensuring rule of law, may bring results to the contrary.  
106. The judgment and the direction  which is being sought from 
this Court in the name of ensuring freedom to practise any religion 
under Article 25 of Indian Constitution or dignity of women under 
Article 21 of Indian Constitution has the potential of being misused 
by a female accused, or a  male accused and their female family  
members . It will also amount to presuming that a woman does not 
commit crime and cannot be an accused who needs to be searched, 
arrested or a raid be conducted to apprehend her. This Court cannot 
pass any such directio n. 
107. While observing so, this Court holds a view that a judgment  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 52 of 64 
 
adjudicating a crucial question of issuance of directions and 
sensitization cannot be purely an Academic exercise . Even an  
academic judgment has to keep in mind as to whether it will invite 
difficulties in administration of justice, rule of law, and at all times, 
keep in mind a pragmatic approach so that the judgment does not 
become a road -block for law enforcement agencies , who may face 
contempt for non -obedience of the judgments and for fear of that, 
continue to face difficulties in performing their actual duties. The 
wide discretion that judges have, should be utilised for improving the 
interest of the country and the community while balancing the law 
and the rights of other law enforcement a gencies to achieve a 
balanced merger of both.  
 
DIRECTIVES ISSUED BY COURTS: NEED TO BE JUSTICE 
DRIVEN AND NOT FAITH DRIVEN  
108. Learned counsel for the petitioner had argued that the 
insensitivity of the police force in general towards the religious 
sentiments of pardanashin  women, who may belong to different 
religions or faiths, is in the teeth of Article 25 of the Constitution of  
India which ensures freedom of practising any religion to an 
individual.  
109. Therefore, one of the issues before this Court was as to 
whether the directions sought from this Court to sensitise the Delhi 
Police and directing them to follow a protocol in view of the religious 
scriptures and religious mandate of women of different religions, is 
called for or not and as to whether in case a protocol is not framed for  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 53 of 64 
 
sensitization of police officers, will it be in violation of Article 25 of 
the Constitution of In dia. 
110. In paragraph nos. 56 to 70, this Court has rejected the 
argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that practise of pardah  
is commonly followed by Hindu or Sikh women, and that there is no 
such mandate to wear a veil or pardah  in these religions.  
111. As far as the practice of wearing hijab  or burqa  in Islam is 
concerned, this Court has already observed in paragraph no. 74 that 
whether such practises  fall under the essential religious practice, so as 
to be covered within the ambit of Article 25 of Constitution of India, 
is an issue which is pending before the Hon‘ble Apex Court for 
adjudication, and there is nothing at this stage to prove that wearing  a 
pardah , or burqa as called in Islam, would be an essential religious 
practice.  
Article 25 of the Constitution has arisen for the religions and not 
from the religions  
112. Article 25 of the Constitution has arisen for the religions and 
not from the religions. While it enshrines the fundamental right to 
freedom of religion, it also delineates that this freedom is not 
absolute; rather, it is subject to considerations of public  order, health, 
and morality.  
113. It is noted that the preservation of public order encompasses 
the broader need of upholding law and order across society, a duty in 
which investigating agencies play a pivotal role. Therefore, while 
individuals have the const itutional right to practise their religion, this  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 54 of 64 
 
right is circumscribed by the need to maintain public order and 
ensure the efficacy of law enforcement efforts.  
114. Thus, while even criminals have certain fundamental 
rights, these cannot serve as barriers to t heir arrest or 
prosecution, except those rights which have been provided under 
law in this regard; rather, their rights have to yield to the 
interests of the state and public safety . It is the primary duty of 
both the Courts and the police to protect the n ation and its 
communities, making it inappropriate to issue directives based on 
faith. Such actions exceed the powers granted to the courts by the 
Constitution and undermine the rule of law.  
115. In police investigations, there cannot be any room for 
anonymity,  as identification is essential for ensuring justice and 
maintaining security.  Allowing anonymity under the guise of 
religious practice or personal choice could open the door to abuse and 
hinder the investigation process. Therefore, it is important that la w 
enforcement agencies have the authority to identify individuals when 
necessary, in order to maintain public order, regardless of veiling 
practices and also regardless of the fact that whether these practices 
would be covered under Article 25 the Constitu tion or not. This 
would ensure transparency, accountability, and fair treatment of all 
individuals involved in the investigative process.  
116. In this Court‟s view, the directions issued by any Court 
must be rooted in legal principles, rather than influenced b y 
religious considerations . Judgments should remain impartial and 
devoid of any religious bias, recognizing that criminality transcends  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 55 of 64 
 
any specific religious affiliation; it concerns the welfare of society as 
a whole.  
 
A JUDGE’S PURE FIDELITY TO THE APPL ICATION OF 
LAW IN CONSONANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF 
MODERN BHARAT  
117. A judge has to meet the critical requirement of its pure 
fidelity to the application of law for the larger community good 
and upholding the fundamental rights of every citizen. The 
judicial responsibility and the judicial obligation of living up to its 
fidelity to law also has to pass the test of practical standpoint of view 
as to what the Court‘s directions would result in.  
118. While at times, a judge may be tempted to find legalis tic 
solution to a problem  placed before it,  however, the temptation 
has to be resisted since the directions sought may not only be 
impractical but also instead of successfully mitigating the alleged 
perceived injustice to some in a situation, may in fact g ive rise to 
unjustified fetters on the power to investigate by the investigating 
agency.  The adjudicated law has to pass the test of being justified on 
the touchstone of procedural and substantive grounds.  
The Social Face of Law: Judges’ Role in Shaping L egal & Social 
Discourse  
119. Undoubtedly, the judges are trained in law and schooled in 
precedents, however, now, law has a social face too . In the 
changing role of judges through adjudication of cases in writ  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 56 of 64 
 
jurisdiction, one finds greater involvement with so cial policy of the 
Court and judges. The judges‘ rulings on social questions inarguably 
affect a large number of members of the community. However, such 
judgments on social policy cannot be segregated or be opposed to the 
legislations and the State policie s which involve the safety and 
security of the country or the community at large.  
120. What distinguishes judges and their judgments is their 
impartiality . The nature of the issues posed before a judge for 
adjudication, and the expectation of a petitioner or t he public at large, 
that those issues will be adjudicated fairly, represent one concept, and 
the need for judges to be sensitive towards a broader range of social 
concerns is another expectation.  
121. Though certain legislations can be gender -specific, the 
judg es, the judgments and the orders are always Genderless . The 
judgments are not only the thoughts or perceptions of a judge and are 
not limited to legal acumen of a judge alone , but also the work 
carried out through the legal acumen of the lawyers/advocates 
assisting the Court.  
 
WHILE CONCLUDING: SOMETIMES EVEN AN ISOLATED 
WORD SPEAKS A STORY  
122. The word pardanashin  conjures an image . When this Court 
uses the word pardanashin , it conjures the picture of a woman who is 
wearing a pardah  and perceived as powerless and one who does not 
understand the worldly affairs, who needs someone to look after her 
legal, personal and other affairs as understood and defined in judicial  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 57 of 64 
 
precedents in context of capacity to enter into a contract. Whateve r a 
Court of law writes, it has to remain cautious that it leaves an 
indelible mark and the philosophy flowing from a judgment is read 
by many to follow. This Court‘s responsibility would be many -fold 
when it is forced to enter the arena of ancient scriptu res and interpret 
it and give a meaning as deemed fit by the petitioner or perceived by 
the petitioner in the modern times.  
123. Therefore, in this Court‘s view, the word Pardanashin  by its 
mere mention conjures an image which is not confined to a word or a 
single picture itself but the entire journey of women in India which 
they have covered from being empowered,  being free of burden of 
a veil, to the indescribable burden of a weightless piece of cloth 
called veil which was full of challenges, troubles and soc ial 
struggles . 
124. This Court has observed in the preceding paragraphs that the 
concept of Pardanashin women was not in the context of any 
religious observance, but purely in the legal context of contracts 
entered into by women, who were not well conversant wi th the 
worldly issues and remained secluded from the world at large. As 
observed already, the judicial precedents, including the one wherein 
the word Pardanashin  was used as early as in the year 1925 in the 
judgment of Farid -Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar Ahmad (supra ), refers to the 
meaning of Pardanashin  woman in the context of entering into a 
contract and not in terms of her religious beliefs.  
125. While considering a question as to whether the concept of 
pardanashin  woman, as explained by the petitioner, is relevant in   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 58 of 64 
 
modern times , this Court would only like to express that much water 
has flown down the empowerment path of woman in India wherein 
by way of their fundamental rights as well as rights available to them 
under other legislations, special provisions have been  made with 
regard to empowerment of women, not on papers alone, but in reality 
ensuring that every girl and every woman is educated; those who are 
young, by being provided with schooling, and those who have not 
had the opportunity to be educated, there bei ng adult education 
centres / Praudh Siksha Kendras .  
126. As far the context of present case is concerned, instead of 
using the word pardanashin , this Court would rather want to term 
it as women who observe a particular dress code in accordance 
with their belie fs and faith , since the word pardanashin  in the past 
has been used in context of women who were not empowered nor 
were considered well conversant with worldly affairs and were 
thought to be incapable of looking after themselves on their own due 
to them liv ing in state of seclusion.  
127. Sometimes an isolated word speaks a story and sometimes 
even a story in itself is not more than a simple word as the words 
used by a Judge in a judgment are forever . The moment this Court 
terms women as Pardanashin  due to their gender in general, it will 
do more harm to them than empower or add value to their already 
existing right to dignity.  
128. Therefore, in the background of the above discussion, and this 
Court having taken note of the well -researched report submit ted by 
the learned Amicus Curiae as well, holds and sums up  the findings  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 59 of 64 
 
of this Court, as under:  
1. The concept of ‗ pardanashin  woman‘ is essentially a legal 
concept, not in context of any religious practice, but in respect 
of capacity to enter into a contra ct. 
2. As the concept of pardanashin  women in Indian law 
essentially revolves around seclusion of a woman from the 
outer world and society at large resulting in their lack of 
understanding of societal affairs, there is less relevancy of this 
concept of pardan ashin  women in the modern era especially in 
the big cities considering the background and the lifestyle of 
modern women . 
3. Since the learned counsel for petitioner had taken this Court 
through various religious scriptures to show prevalence of 
practise of pardah  among Hindus, Sikhs, etc., the discussion 
made by this Court in paragraph nos. 56 to 70, inter alia on 
Ramayana  & Mata Sita , and Brihadaranyaka  Upanishad, will 
point out the fact that neither the Hindu women practised 
any pardah  nor was it mandatory f or them. They always 
were empowered till a particular era, and the history will 
speak for itself regarding its causes when Hindu women 
were burdened with the weight of a pardah,  which though 
weight -less, carried unbearable weight for a woman who 
wears it, which cannot be explained in words . Thus, to sum 
up, in Hindus there is no mandatory provision to wear veil or 
ghoonghat, or Hindu women being pardanashin by virtue of  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 60 of 64 
 
their religion. Same is the scenario in case of Sikh women. In 
India, however, everyone can make their individual choices.  
4. Further, the law enforcement agencies and their investigations 
cannot be driven by religious practices  but have to be 
community and safety driven.  
5. The fundamental rights , including those enshrined under 
Article 25 of the Constitution have to surrender in favour of 
the safety of the country and the community irrespective of the 
gender of the accused, and in case of Article 25, the rights are 
subject to reasonable restrictions such as maintaining public 
order.  
6. Faith based di rections cannot be issued by this Court , for 
the police officers who carry out investigation in criminal 
cases, lest it affects their power to investigate as provided to 
them by law.  
129. This Court has also taken note of the fact that while seeking 
directions  from this Court regarding sensitization of the police 
officials apropos  the special procedure which should be followed in 
cases of women who wear pardah , the petitioner has also highlighted 
certain aspects which may be considered while sensitising  the police 
officials. Some of these aspects, highlighted in the petition, are 
sensitisation qua already available legal safeguards in relation to the 
procedure which the police authorities need to follow in case of arrest 
of a person and search of a place , and training initiatives to the police 
officers in regards to the same. This Court, while considering the 
same , has already reiterated  the procedure for arrest and search of  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 61 of 64 
 
place in the preceding paragraphs, which finds its mention in the 
statutory laws  and has also been laid down by the Courts in a plethora 
of judgments. There is no gainsaying that all the police officers, 
while carrying out investigation in a criminal case, are bound by 
the laws governing the procedure for search, arrest, etc. which 
already encompass the safeguards for ensuring dignity of women.  
In other words, the powers of police are already subject to several 
reasonable restrictions imposed vide statutory laws as well as judicial 
precedents, which also include safeguards for ensuring  dignity of all 
women. No other directions, including faith based directives, are 
called for in this regard.  
130. The Courts are neither historians nor they can take the role 
of historians , however, if by way of a petition and its contents, the 
history or the r eligious texts are projected in incorrect perspective, 
the Courts have to answer the same by referring to the same 
scriptures or commentaries thereon on case to case basis without 
interpolating their own personal faith, morality, being judgmental 
about cho ices made by other woman, solely  resting their findings on 
the true fidelity of the judge to law and the constitution. Therefore, 
there also arose a need to discuss the concept of pardah  in the 
religions mentioned by the petitioner in the petition, at the same 
time, clarifying that religion and dharma  are different concepts, 
and thereby dispeling and rejecting the contention that wearing a 
veil by a woman makes her pardanashin and that different 
religions (as per petitioner) prescribed wearing of veil as a 
mandatory practise .   
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 62 of 64 
 
131. Why this Court felt the need to delve deep into the concept 
of religion, dharma  and religious practices , in context of laying 
down any directions and exam ining as to whether non -issuance of 
directions will amount to continuing with violation of Article 25 of 
the Constitution of India qua certain segment of women, was due to 
the fact that such judgments and directions as well as discussions 
therein are often  prone to misinterpretation and misrepresentation, 
which at times, may do more harm when passed in context of 
religions scriptures than good, and therefore, a detailed judgment in 
this case was passed.  
132. Needless to say, the judges communicate with the publi c and 
the community at large through their judgments, conveying a social 
message and direction wherever required. Thus, given the critical 
impact of judgments on large segments of the community, they must 
be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for misin terpretation to 
the detriment or disadvantage of any gender or community member. 
Thus, the judgment has to speak and be complete in itself.  
 
BEFORE PARTING WITH THE CASE: SYNERGY 
BETWEEN BAR & BENCH  
133. In many cases, the lawyers become the voice of the society at 
large  which is presented before  the Courts through a petition by an 
advocate and thereafter, given a meaning for the community by the 
judge, as judges themselves are products of the society . In cases 
where lawyers bring forward social causes and  provide the judiciary 
with an opportunity to intervene, the resulting judgments often  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 63 of 64 
 
transcend individual interests. Instead, they serve as catalysts for 
societal transformation, addressing systemic injustices and fostering 
greater inclusivity and equali ty.  
134. These judgments , which are not solely focused on 
individual grievances but rather on broader societal issues, 
exemplify the power of the judiciary to effect meaningful change, 
however at the same time, not forgetting the contribution made 
by the lawye rs working and sitting in the office or appearing in 
the Court  through leveraging the legal system to advocate for social 
causes. It has to be mentioned and stressed that lawyers help create 
opportunities for judicial intervention that can lead to landmark  
rulings with far-reaching implications.  
135. Whenever a petitioner seeks any direction, or relief based on 
faith/religion, it becomes critical and imperative that the hallmark of 
justice, which is being unbiased, treating everyone before it fairly, 
equally, ir respective of their caste, creed, gender, financial or other 
status or their faith or religion and protecting their fundamental 
rights, should be reflected in the judgment.  
136. In this Court's opinion, the personal perceptions of a judge 
or her faith or her o pinions in life should never become the 
ideological backdrop of the judgments, she writes .  
137. This Court is also of the opinion that it is part of duty  and 
sociological service by a Court of law to the community and 
country that it does not shy away from the pressing need of 
adjudicating any issue raised before it, howsoever contentious or 
sensitive, concerning the justice system without fear of being  
W.P.(CRL) 3502/2023                                                                                                  Page 64 of 64 
 
trolled, criticised, mocked and taken upon it as her obligation in 
the role of a judge.  
138. The present case is one example of the above . 
139. Thus, this Court expresses deep appreciation  for the learned 
counsel who appeared on behalf of petitioner Sh. M. Sufian 
Siddi qui, for bringing this case before this Court, as well as the 
learned Amicus Curiae Smt. Manisha Agrawal Narain, who through 
her well -researched and elaborate report, shed light on various issues 
relevant in the present case.  
140. In above terms, the present petition stands disposed of.  
141. Copy of this judgment be forwarded to Director (Academics), 
Delhi Police Academy, for the purpose of training and sensitisation 
of all concerned.  
142. The judgment  be uploaded on the website forthwith.

SWARANA KANTA SHARMA, J.

PRELUDE
1. The journey of adjudication of this case presented many challenges as the learned counsel for petitioner drew this Courts attention to the most ancient scriptures of various faiths and his point of view regarding the concept of pardanashin woman in the said scriptures, at the same time, praying for the application of the old concept of pardanashin women to the modern age empowered and educated woman. 
2. Thus, the challenge before this Court was to adjudicate and return a finding as to whether the concept of pardanashin woman, as argued and enumerated by the learned counsel for petitioner, indeed means and refers to women who by mere virtue of their gender need to be extended special treatment, as according to the learned counsel, even today many women are pardanashin out of their own choice or due to them following their respective religious practices.
3. Learned counsel for the petitioner prayed that guidelines be issued in the background of religious scriptures and Article 21 and 25 of the Constitution of India, however, giving a new meaning, a new philosophy and evolving new jurisprudence based on old scriptures to suit the present day requirements of the community.
4. As this Court writes this judgment, it notes that writ jurisdiction and adjudication of the issues therein do not stop springing surprises and challenges which become the harbinger of churning out philosophy and jurisprudence on a subject which involves referring to old scriptures, interpreting it in context of a particular case, yet confining itself within constitutional morality and framework of criminal jurisprudence. 
5. The present case also raised an issue which initially confined itself to a particular person. However, in the final hearing, the person oriented prayers were satisfied and withdrawn on behalf of the petitioner but insistence was laid on adjudication of an issue brought forth by the present case for the larger societal interest, thus, bringing to the fore the power of Court to serve the community better by bringing about changes in the administration of criminal justice by issuance of directions wherever called for qua the concerned authorities.

RELIEFS SOUGHT BEFORE THIS COURT
6. The present writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) has been preferred on behalf of the petitioner, praying as follows:
a. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to forthwith conduct an in-depth inquiry/investigation in a fair, impartial and time-bound manner under the direct supervision of DCP Vigilance or a Police Official of a Higher Rank, into the Petitioners Complaint dated: 11.11.2023 and the communications sent subsequent thereto, apropos the reprehensible incident that occurred during the intervening night of 05-06th November 2023 at around 03:00 AM involving serious high handed, illegal and contemptuous acts perpetrated by several delinquent police officials of (Central-District) particularly of P.S. Chandni Mahal inter-alia including criminal trespass, illegal house search, forcibly taking the petitioner, who is a Purdahnashin Muslim Women from her residence without her Purdah/Veil and parading her to the Police Station, illegally detaining her at P.S. Chandni Mahal, subjecting her to inhuman and degrading treatment including physical assault, violating her dignity, during the night in flagrant violation of Section 46(4) & 60(A) Cr.P.C, thereby causing brazen infraction of her Fundamental Rights as Guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution as well as International Human Rights as Guaranteed under Article 3, 5 & 7 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); And

b. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to take apposite stringent legal action against the concerned delinquent police officials of (Central-District) particularly of P.S. Chandni Mahal for their ex-facie concerted, premeditated, illegal, contemptuous and iniquitous acts of transgression thereby infringing, instead of protecting the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner as Guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, notwithstanding their express knowledge about the consequences likely to follow; And

c. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to adequately compensate the petitioner for the ex-facie egregious acts of his subordinate police officers culpable of violating, instead of safeguarding, the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner, as Guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, in terms of the Honble Supreme Courts concurring judgment authored by Justice A.S. Anand passed in the case of Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa & Others reported as [(1993) 2 SCC 746]; And

d. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to forthwith secure and place on record the CCTV footage of all the Cameras installed inside and around Police Station Chandni Mahal (Central-District) from 01:00 AM to 05:00 PM dated: 06.11.2023, on an exigent basis, in terms of the Honble Supreme Courts judgment dated: 02.12.2020 passed in the case of Paramvir Singh Saini vs Baljit Singh & Others Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No.3543/2020. And

e. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to forthwith secure and place on record the CCTV footage of all the Cameras installed by the GNCTD and/or private residents near the petitioners residence leading to the Police Station- Chandni Mahal (Central-District) from 01:00 AM to 06:00 AM dated: 06.11.2023, on an exigent basis, which is ephemeral in nature, and if not secured immediately, may lead to the destruction of vital evidence in petitioners quest for justice; And

f. Issue a Writ of Mandamus or any other analogous Writ, Order or Direction thereby directing the respondent herein to sensitize the Delhi Police apropos the sacrosanct religious, social customs and practices observed by all the women who observe Purdah either as a religious belief or as a part of their personal choice belonging to any religion, which are Guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution as their Fundamental Rights.

FACTUAL BACKDROP
7. Briefly summarised, the facts of the case, as disclosed from Status Report, are that on 05.11.2023, at about 10:00 am, at least six different PCR calls were received at P.S. Chandni Mahal, Delhi regarding a quarrel taking place at Rakab Ganj, behind Delite Cinema, Delhi. When the police had reached the spot, it was revealed that one Mohd. Tahir and his nephew Mohd. Anas had been assaulted by Mohd. Rehan, Mohd. Irfan and Mohd. Gayasuddin alongwith some unknown persons and the victims had been taken to LNJP Hospital for treatment. When the police team had reached the hospital, they were informed that the injured Mohd. Anas was under treatment and was unfit to give a statement. In the meantime, accused Mohd. Rehan and Gayasuddin had also reached the same hospital for treatment. On the same night, at about 1:00 AM, accused Mohd. Rehan had fled from the hospital and thereafter, at about 1:30 AM, an information was received at P.S. Chandni Mahal that accused Mohd. Rehan accompanied by some other persons had attempted to brutally murder the victim Mohd. Anas by inflicting serious injuries with a surgical blade, who was undergoing treatment at the surgery department on the fourth floor of the hospital.
8. Due to the aforesaid acts of the accused persons, there was grave apprehension of threat to the life of Mohd. Tahir i.e. the complainant and his other family members, and accordingly, the police had started patrolling in the area and had stationed themselves outside the house of complainant as well as the accused. The present petitioner is the sister of accused persons namely Mohd. Rehan, Mohd. Irfan and Mohd. Gayasuddin. It is submitted in the Status Report that when the police had reached the house of petitioner, it was found locked, but the lights of the house were switched on and the petitioner was peeping from her balcony, watching the activities in the street, unveiled. Thereafter, the police officials had enquired from her about her brothers, but she had denied having any knowledge of their whereabouts. She had even told that she did not have the keys of the house to let police search the same. It is the case of State that, throughout these conversations, the petitioner stood there without any veil, and it was the petitioner herself who later had requested the police officials to take her to police station as she feared any possible retaliation from the side persons who had been allegedly injured by the brothers of the petitioner.
9. Conversely, the petitioner alleges that the police had entered her house, though she is a pardanashin woman, and had taken her to the police station, dragging her from her house to the police station, and not giving her time to wear pardah, knowing fully well that she is a pardanashin woman and thus, the action of the police exceeded its authority by not allowing the petitioner to wear a veil. 
10. In a complaint written to the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, the petitioner alleged that during the intervening night of 05-06.11.2023, at around 03:00 AM, she had found herself confronted by a group of police officials from P.S. Chandni Mahal who had allegedly engaged in high-handed, illegal, and contemptuous behaviour. Despite her repeated assertion that her brothers were not present within the premises, the officers had attempted to forcefully gain entry in her house. Thereafter, despite her repeated assurances that the individuals they were looking for i.e. Rehan and Irfan were not present in the house, the police officials, without waiting any further, had forcibly entered her house and had started carrying out a search of her residence. While searching the house, the police officials had not found anyone, and then, they had forcefully dragged the petitioner out of her house. 
11. Thus, the main grievance of the petitioner, which has also resulted in filing of the present petition, is that the petitioner is a pardanashin woman, and she was not wearing her pardah when she was moved out of her house. It is alleged that the petitioner was then taken to the police station and was wrongfully confined there. It has also been alleged that prior to her release, she was subjected to threats and intimidation, warning her against pursuing any formal complaint regarding the incident, however, no relief or action was forthcoming, resulting in filing of the present petition.
12. The police, on the other hand, termed the complaint and the present writ petition filed before this Court as an afterthought and misconceived, in order to divert attention from the heinous acts committed by her brothers. It is also averred that the CCTV footage placed on record would clarify that the allegations against the police officers are false and fabricated.

ORDERS PASSED BY THIS COURT
13. Vide order dated 30.11.2023, the State was directed to preserve the CCTV footage of all the cameras installed in the vicinity of P.S. Chandni Mahal, Delhi of the relevant point of time, as well as of the cameras installed by the government near the petitioners residence leading towards the direction of P.S. Chandni Mahal. The relevant portion of order reads as under: 
5. The respondent is directed to preserve the CCTV footage of all the cameras installed inside and around PS.: Chandni Mahal, Central-District, Delhi for the time period from 01:00 AM to 05:00 PM on 06.11.2023 as well as the CCTV footage of all the cameras installed by the GNCTD and/ or private residents near the petitioners residence leading towards the direction of the PS.: Chandni Mahal, Central-District, Delhi for the time period from 01:00 AM to 06:00 AM on 06.11.2023. 

14. Thereafter, the order dated 30.01.2024 was passed wherein it was directed that present writ be treated as representation by the concerned DCP (Vigilance). The same reads as under:
4. As far as other prayers are concerned, the present writ petition will be treated as a representation on behalf of the petitioner herein. The concerned DCP (Vigilance) will look into the same and the intimation will be given to the petitioner herein about the outcome of the same, within two months from today.

15. However, learned counsel for the petitioner had prayed for passing of detailed order as far as clause (f) of the prayer is concerned, and this Court had reserved the judgment qua prayer clause (f). 

SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
16. Learned counsel for the petitioner argues that the petitioner herein is a pardanashin Muslim woman, and she has a fundamental right to wear pardah which is the Islamic dress code for women, which not only consists of a scarf that covers the head, the neck and bosom, but it also includes the overall dress that should be long and loose. It is argued that the petitioner, being a Muslim woman, is well within her rights to conduct herself in accordance with the tenets of her religion, including her choice of dress, as protected by Article  25 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion. This extends to matters of personal liberty under Article 21, encompassing the right to live with dignity and make choices aligned with individual autonomy. Additionally, the constitutional safeguard provided by Article 29, which protects the interests of minorities, further reinforces the right to preserve distinctive cultural practices, potentially including religious attire. 
17. It is further argued that the Article 25 of the Constitution, which is a fundamental right, does not come in the way of police in the discharge of their statutory duties or infringes or encroaches upon the rights of other citizens. It does not fall within reasonable restrictions as imposed on every citizen by the Constitution as it neither affects public order, morality and health nor other provisions of the Constitution. 
18. It is prayed that it is not just desired but also the need of the hour to sensitise the Delhi Police qua fostering understanding and respect for women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or as a part of their personal choice belonging to any religion. It is submitted that in a diverse and multicultural society like India, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies understand and respect the cultural practices of various communities, particularly those pertaining to women observing pardah. Pardah, representing a practice deeply rooted in modesty and privacy, requires a nuanced and sensitive approach from the police to ensure the protection of women's rights while upholding law and order. Thus, with a view to sensitise the Delhi police, the following quintessential aspects may be considered, which are as follows: 
(i) Understanding pardah practices signifying commitment to modesty, dignity and privacy by the police and ensure that they respect the choice of women adhering to this tradition.
(ii) The Delhi Police be sensitised about the constitutional guarantees and Indian Laws, guaranteeing freedom of religion and observing pardah by women being one of such constitutional guarantees to practice religion.
(iii) Delhi Police being sensitised and trained by cultural experts, community leaders and women from different backgrounds for formulating and preparation of training modules which should cover significance of pardah and its various manifestations across communities.
(iv) Delhi Police be trained with effective communication strategies.
(v)  Delhi Police be trained about community, policing and building trust.
(vi)  Delhi Police be trained to handle situations by ensuring women are treated with dignity during investigations and interactions.
(vii) Special provisions be made to accommodate pardah practices particularly in context of identity verification or witness statements.
(viii) Monitoring mechanism to evaluate such sensitization programmes.
19. While explaining pardah practices, it is argued that Pardah is a cultural and religious tradition followed by many women across different communities transcending religious boundaries in India. Often associated with veiling and seclusion, it signifies a commitment to modesty, dignity, and privacy. The police force, as the frontline enforcers of law and order, must familiarise themselves with the cultural nuances surrounding pardah to ensure respectful and effective interactions with women adhering to this tradition. It is argued that Indian laws, including constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and protection of women's rights, form the foundation for a balanced approach. The police need to be aware of these legal safeguards while discharging their duties. Respecting religious freedom, gender equality, and the right to privacy are crucial elements that should guide police interactions with women observing pardah.
20. It is argued that sensitising the police forces involves comprehensive training initiatives that instil cultural awareness and understanding. Training modules should cover the significance of pardah, its various manifestations across communities, and the legal protections in place for women practising it. Interactive sessions with cultural experts, community leaders, and women from different backgrounds can enhance the police force's sensitivity. It is argued that effective communication lies at the heart of building positive police-community relations. Officers should be trained to communicate respectfully and courteously with women observing purdah, taking into account the cultural and religious sensitivities involved. Clear guidelines on communication, avoiding unnecessary intrusion into personal spaces, and providing women with a comfortable environment for interaction should be emphasised.
Argument regarding practice of Pardah existing in all religions and followed by women of all religions
21. It is further argued that the practice of pardah among women in India exists in different forms of Ghunghat, Pallu, Dupatta, Burqa, Hijab and so on. Covering the head has religious significance, particularly for women since time immemorial. 
22. In Sikhism, for instance, the turban, an article of faith, distinguishes Sikhs from the others. Sikh women who have traditionally worn headscarves (chuni) are now wearing turbans, much like Sikh men. 
23. It is further submitted that many Hindu women wear the Ghoonghat or the Ghungta, which emanates from the Sanskrit word, Avagunthana in India. There is a wide vocabulary of words for Avagunthana in the earliest forms of Sanskrit. Avagunthana was a cloak-like covering of the upper part of body, Uttariya was a covering till the shoulders, Adhikantha Pata was a covering till the neck and Sirovastra was a covering simply for the head. 
24. It is further mentioned that pardah was prevalent even during Valmikis Ramayana. The practice, which signifies seclusion of women, had assumed the form of a recognized social custom. When Sita sets out with her husband to the forest, Valmiki expresses regret that, a lady, who had so far not been seen even by the spirits of the sky, should now become an object of public gaze. 
25. Apart from the Ramayana, the head covering or a veil finds a mention in many Sanskrit plays. For instance, Sudraka, the author of Mrichhakatika, mentions that women wore Avagunthana, a thin veil, to hide their beauty and to enhance their coiffures. Similarly, ancient Indian playsKalidasas Abhijnana Sakuntalam, Bhasas Pratimanataka, Sisupalavadha, Dashakumaracharita, etc., among others indicate that women wore veils to cover their heads. 
Argument regarding women wearing pardah/ghoonghat in modern India
26. It is also submitted that even today, in modern India, one finds Hindu women covered by the Ghoonghat. However, Hijab, which is a traditional scarf worn by Muslim women to cover the hair and neck and sometimes the face, is different from Burqa, which is a tip to toe gown covering the entire body. Both, however, are types of veils worn by some Muslim women. Burqa is a word that loosely falls under the category of pardah or veil. It is stated that Pardah is a Persian word translated as curtain, veil, attire worn by women to mark their social and physical segregation from the rest of society by covering their bodies and/or faces. Pardah takes different dimensions depending on the country, place of origin and hence has numerous variations.
27. In the aforesaid background, it is argued that Delhi police officials are highly insensitive and apathetic towards sacrosanct religious and social practices and customs followed by women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or as a part. It is further argued that cogitating the disconcerting facts of the present case, it appears that the Police Officials of Delhi Police are completely insensitive and apathetic towards the observance of sacrosanct religious and social practices and customs followed by all the women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or as a part of their personal choice belonging to any religion, which are guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.

SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF STATE
28. Learned ASC for the State argues that the facts as presented by the petitioner are false and fabricated, and the law enforcement agencies had followed the due process of law. It is further argued that though the petitioner says that she is a pardanashin woman, she was standing in her balcony on the day of incident and looking down the street, without wearing any veil. 
29. As regards the grant of prayer (f) i.e. for issuance of directions to police, for their sensitization, it is submitted by learned ASC that there is no such requirement for an extra layer of procedure to be followed by the law enforcement agencies, as it will create a barrier to fair investigation, search procedures, and arrest, when it is required. It is submitted that there exists enough safeguards in law to protect the dignity of every individual, including an accused. 
30. It is also argued that there is no concept of pardah or pardanashin in most religions as suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioner and therefore, the relief sought by the petitioner, in the form of issuance of directions qua sensitization of police officers, must be not granted.

REPORT OF AMICUS CURIAE
31. This Court, while reserving this judgment on 30.01.2024, had also passed an order appointing Smt. Manisha Agrawal Narain, Advocate as Amicus Curiae in this case to assist the Court on the issues raised on behalf of the petitioner, as far as prayer clause (f) is concerned. 
32. Report dated 22.02.2024 has been filed by Smt. Manisha Agrawal Narain, learned Amicus Curiae. The report begins by summarising that the petitioner has stated that she is a pardanashin Muslim woman who wears burqa; and is seeking sensitization of police regarding the sacrosanct practices of pardah observed by women either as per religion or as per choice. The petition seeks to sensitise police about the sacrosanct religious, social customs and practices observed by all women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or as a part of their personal choice.
33. In the above context, it is submitted by learned Amicus that there has been an ongoing global debate about the privacy of a pardanashin woman on one hand, and the necessity of recognizability and identification of people for the ends of public order and security concerns on the other hand. While Burqa/Veil/Pardah may be worn by well-meaning women, but the same can be misused by the offenders of law to disguise themselves. It is submitted that anything which empowers a person to hide her/his identity may come in the way of efficient investigation, thus affecting public order. 
34. It is further submitted that veiling the face or covering the whole body practically veils the identity and recognizability of a person. However, identification of persons is critical to investigation done by the police. Assertion of remaining inside Burqa/Veil/Pardah may lead to promotion of anonymity in public; and can be counterproductive to the investigation. 
35. Another issue, as flagged by learned Amicus, is whether the veil is sacrosanct essential religious practice of the various communities in India. It is submitted that in Commissioner of Police v. Acharya Jagadishwarananda Avadhuta (2004) 12 SCC 770, Honble Apex Court held that essential part of a religion means the core beliefs upon which a religion is founded. The test to determine whether a part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out whether the nature of the religion would be changed without that part or practise, and if it be so, then such part could be treated as an essential or integral part of the religion. Some other decisions such as Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj Etc. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors AIR 1963 SC 1638, A.S. Narayana Deekshitulu v. State of A.P. (1996) 9 SCC 548, etc. are also relied upon by the learned Amicus in this regard, and it is submitted that on the basis of these tests, Courts have held various practices like triple talaq, cow-sacrifice, Tandav dance, etc. to be not constituting the essential parts of religion. 
36. It is then submitted that in Ancient Hindu texts, it is seen that pardah was not an essential religious practice. In this regard, reference is made to excerpts from the Sundarkand, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, etc. 
37. It is also submitted that taking into consideration the five duties laid down for the Muslims by the Prophet and the five Hukum of Allah in Shariat, as per Mullas Mohammedan Law, 5th edition, 2019, it will be difficult to hold that wearing of Burqa/Veil/Pardah is such a mandatory practise which must be followed in order to remain in Islam. It is stated that many countries, including Islamic countries across the globe, have already banned the burqah/pardah/veil.
38. Learned Amicus submits that Article 21 of the Constitution encompasses right to privacy, but whether there is a fundamental right to remain unrecognised or anonymous, is a relevant question here. In this regard, it is submitted that enforcement of law and  investigation of offences require effective identification and recognisability of  persons. However, this would not mean that pardanashin women should not be treated with decency, and rather, like every other human being, pardanashin women also have a fundamental right to be treated with dignity and decency. However, right to wear Pardah/Burqa/Veil cannot take away the rights of investigating agencies and if required, the police is well within its rights to identify the face of the pardanashin person. In doing so, the police needs to follow the same dignified behaviour with  pardanashin women as is required for all other women (which includes presence of lady member in police team, if a woman is to be searched). 

ISSUES AT THE CORE
39. The petitioner had approached this Court seeking various reliefs, yet one common thread among her pleas is the call for greater sensitivity towards the needs of Pardanashin women by law enforcement agencies and that in case the relief sought for is not granted, the existing approach and protocol of criminal investigation qua women in Delhi will be in violation of Article 21 and 25 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the issues for consideration before this Court are:

I. Whether the religions mentioned by the petitioner, i.e. Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Jainism,  Christianity, mandate wearing of pardah, veil, ghoonghat, and any alleged restriction or grant of non-opportunity to wear pardah during any stage of investigation will amount to violation of Article 25 of the Constitution of India?
II.  Whether women, who choose to wear veil, ought to be afforded specific safeguards, entailing that law enforcement agencies guarantee sufficient time and privacy for them to properly wear their veils? 
III.  Whether this Court should issue directions for sensitization of officers of Delhi Police apropos religious, social and customary practices observed by pardanashin women? 

WHO IS A PARDANASHIN WOMAN
Meaning in Strict Legal Connotation of the Term
40. Pardanashin women, steeped in tradition and seclusion, embody a cultural practice deeply rooted in history. This term refers to women who adhere to strict rules of seclusion, often shielding themselves from the outside world behind veils or screens. Throughout history, various legal systems and traditions have established special provisions to safeguard the interests and preserve the dignity of pardanashin women in various facets of life, including contractual matters.
41. The history of pardanashin women traces back to the adoption of pardah, a practice originating from Persian customs. Initially embraced by Muslim communities influenced by Persian culture, pardah gradually permeated Northern India during the reign of the Mughal Empire. Under Mughal rule, Hindu upper-class women also embraced the practice, while women from lower socioe-conomic strata, tasked with managing households and engaging in agricultural work, did not adhere to it as rigorously. During the colonial era under British rule, the practice of pardah gained widespread acceptance and was enforced with greater stringency. However, in modern times, its prevalence has declined, coinciding with a shift towards greater openness and independence among women, as well as matter of choice. Despite these changes, the legal protections afforded to pardanashin women remain significant, rooted in principles of equity and conscience.
42. The vulnerability of pardanashin women to exploitation and undue influence is a salient concern addressed by legal safeguards. Given their limited exposure to external influences and the potential for manipulation, it is critical to afford these women enhanced protections under the law. The presumption of undue influence underlines the importance of ensuring that decisions made by pardanashin women are free from coercion or external pressures, thereby safeguarding their rights and preserving their autonomy.
43. While societal norms may evolve over time, the duty to safeguard the rights and dignity of all individuals remains steadfast. Through legal protections rooted in principles of equity and conscience, pardanashin women are afforded the necessary safeguards to navigate a changing world while preserving their cultural identity and autonomy.
Judicial Precedents defining Pardanashin Woman
44. The Honble Apex Court in case of Mst. Kharbuja Kuer v. Jangbahadur Rai (1963) 1 SCR 456, while discussing the concept of pardanashin women, referred to the decision authored by five Judge-bench of Privy Council in case of Farid-Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar Ahmad 1925 SCC OnLine PC 44, and observed as under:
5. In India pardahnashin ladies have been given a special protection in view of the social conditions of the times; they are presumed to have an Imperfect knowledge of the world, as, by the pardah system they are practically excluded from social intercourse and communion with the outside world. In Farid-Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar Ahmad Lord Sumner traces the origin of the custom and states the principle on which the presumption is based. The learned Lord observed:
""In this it has only given the special development, which Indian social usages make necessary, to the general rules of English law, which protect persons, whose disabilities make them dependent upon or subject them to the influence of others, even though nothing in the nature of deception or coercion may have occurred. This is part of the law relating to personal capacity to make binding transfers or settlements of property of any kind.""
The learned Lord also points out:
""Of course fraud, duress and actual undue influence are separate matters.""
It is, therefore, manifest that the rule evolved for the protection of pardahnashin ladies shall not be confused with other doctrines, such as, fraud, duress and actual undue influence, which apply to all persons whether they be pardahnashin ladies or not.
(Emphasis supplied)

45. In case of Smt. Andhi Kuer v. Rajeshwar Singh 1972 SCC OnLine Pat 78, the High Court of Patna expressed as under: 
..The expression Pardanashin has not to be confused with a lady observing parda. A lady observing parda may not be a pardanashin lady in the legal sense of the term. The term pardanashin lady is not a term of art. It has special legal significance as one who is unable to understand the transaction by virtue of the manner in which she has been brought up 
(Emphasis supplied)

46. In the case of Fayyaz-Ud-Din v. Kutab-Ud-Din 1928 SCC OnLine Lah 554, the Lahore Bench had held that a woman belonging to a family of barbers, keeping a hamam in the town of Delhi, whose females did not live in a state of seclusion, is not pardanashin.
47. The High Court of Madras, in case of Chidambaram Pillai v. Muthammal 1992 SCC OnLine Mad 306, had discussed the judicial precedents on the issue of pardanashin women and had expressed as under:
15. A section of womenfolk in view of the social conditions of the limes are presumed to have imperfect knowledge of the world, as the Supreme Court has said in the case of Mst. Kharbuja Kher AIR 1963 S.C. 1203. They are presumed to have imperfect knowledge of the world, as, by the pardah system, they are practically excluded from social intercourse and communion with the outside world. The origin is traced to the Indian social usages and the general rules of English Law which protect persons whose disabilities make them dependent upon or subject them to the influence of others, even though nothing in the nature of deception or coercion may have occurred, applicable to such section of women
16. The pardah system as understood by the courts in India is not the system of keeping a woman under veil indoors in zenana, but in seclusion, away from the knowledge of the world, in the sense that they are not ordinarily allowed to interact with the male folk and are kept away from social intercourse and communion with the outside world. The view of the Lahore Court in the case of Favvar-ud-din v. Kutab-ud-Din had almost worked as an alarm for the courts to develop a sense that any strict meaning to parda was going to exclude a greatly deprived section of the society from the protection cloak of the law, namely, the illiterate women and other women having such infirmities that they practically live without any social intercourse and communion with the outside world. The judicial consensus, as we have already noticed, has been expressed thus:-
""The rules regarding transaction by the Pardanashin apply equally to illiterate women though they may not be in a strict sense Pardanashin,""
A Pardanashin may not be illiterate, but she still may be ignorant in the sense that she has an imperfect knowledge of the world, and she is practically excluded from social Intercourse and communion with the outside world. Her ignorance is the curse of a social usage that womenfolk depend upon malefolk for transaction of their business with the outside world. Thus, not all women, but only those those who are practically excluded from social intercourse and communion with the outside world fall in this category. If it is for this reason that they are taken as persons suffering from disabilities which make them dependent upon or subject to the influence of others, the illiterate women who, for the reason of social compulsion are required to move out to work in the fields and elsewhere for livelihood, cannot be said to be less disabled and deprived. Even if they are intelligent to know where to go and how to earn their livelihood, yet they cannot read anything nor write anything, and unless told about the contents by others, will not know what the document contains. To the extent the character, content and the effect of the document are concerned, she has to be presumed to be ignorant by sheer illiteracy, the curse which is still pervading the ancient society particularly the women living in this part of the country, a fact about which, we think, we are competent to take judicial notice. We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view that the special cloak of protection applied to Pardanashin women has to be applied to illiterate women as well.
(Emphasis supplied)

The Changing Meaning and Notions of the Concept of Pardanashin Woman
48. The changing meaning and notions of the concept of pardanashin and its relevance in the present times was discussed by the Division Bench of High Court of Gauhati in Mustt. Jubeda Khatun v. Sulaiman Khan 1985 SCC OnLine Gau 15. The relevant observations are as under:
5. A pardanashin lady, in its legal meaning is a woman of the rank who lives in seclusion, shut in the zenana, having no communication except from behind the pardah or screen with any person save a few near relations. A pardanashin woman need not necessarily be a woman of rank. If on account of the rules and customs of society she has to keep herself within the zenana and to lead a life of seclusion without any contact with the outside world, she is a Pardahnashin woman. 
However, this old notion has now been taken a notable change along with the age and the circumstances surrounding the society at large. The present society has been advanced to a new dimension in its educational; cultural and social atmosphere. A large number of women folk either Hindu, Muslim or Christian are now holding a responsible job in all spheres of avocation. In the present trend of the society only those who are residing in interior places and governed by strict custom prevailing in the society are confined under Pardah.
*** 
7. WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE PRESENT DAY URBAN PARDANASHIN LADIES? DO THEY STAND IN THE SAME POSITION WITH THOSE OF PARDANASHINS?
All town-bred ladies, in parda or not, know that physician should be called when there is illness in the house. Almost all know that when a legal document is to be executed lawyer should be consulted. There may be quasi pardanashin ladies in urban areas but all of them know the necessity of taking lawyers aid in transacting documents. The position is changing fast and as such the application of the principle should be confined to real pardanashin ladies who are really ignorant, infirm and illiterate living in seclusion behind the parda. I am, therefore, of the opinion that principles enunciated should be applied to all pardanashin who men who are really pardanashin 
(Emphasis supplied)

49. Thus, in the legal connotation of the term, a woman qualifies as pardanashin when she leads a life of complete seclusion, detached from the broader societal interactions and experiences. The premise underlying the legal protection afforded to pardanashin women is the recognition that their seclusion renders them vulnerable to exploitation and injustice. By extending special safeguards, the law seeks to mitigate the risks associated with their seclusion and ensure that their rights and interests are upheld.

PARDANASHIN WOMAN: EXAMINING THE MEANING IN THE CONTEXT OF PETITIONERS USAGE 
50. In the contents of petition, it has been mentioned that petitioner is a pardanashin woman and during the arguments before this Court, learned counsel for the petitioner had contended that even in modern India, a large number of women still practice pardah in different religions and are therefore pardanashin women. Therefore, they should be considered as a special category, who should be treated with dignity and sensitivity by the police force while investigating any criminal case. 
51. The use of word pardanashin by the learned counsel for the petitioner was in context of women who observe pardah or veil, and thus, being specifically entitled to protection by this Court by issuance of directions to Delhi Police to sensitise them as to how they should deal with such women who observe pardah. This necessitated this Court to go into the meaning of pardanashin women.
52. The petitioner has employed the term pardanashin interchangeably with burqa, ghoonghat, pallu, etc. and as indicative of someone under a veil. While the petitioner may equate pardanashin with individuals under a veil, such as women wearing burqas, it is essential to recognize the difference between the two.
53. In legal parlance, pardanashin woman would refer to those who are entirely secluded from the wider societal sphere or lack a comprehensive understanding of societal norms and reasoning. This strict interpretation is crucial for determining the applicability of special legal protections afforded to those classified as pardanashin. Such protections are designed to safeguard individuals who, due to their seclusion or lack of understanding, may be vulnerable to exploitation or undue influence.
54. While the petitioner may use the term pardanashin to denote a woman under a veil, this does not align with the legal meaning, which requires complete seclusion or a lack of societal understanding. The petitioners usage of the term pardanashin would include a woman wearing a veil, despite not being living in seclusion or despite possessing sufficient knowledge and understanding of societal norms.
History Behind the Veil: Understanding Pardah in Various Cultures
55. The petitioner has broadened the interpretation of parda to embrace a multicultural perspective, encompassing women from various cultural backgrounds and customs.
Hinduism
56. An example of such a traditional custom given by the petitioner is ghoonghat (also called ghunghat, ghunghta, ghomta, orhni, odani, laaj, chunari, jhund, kundh), a form of head covering predominantly worn by Hindu women, even in modern India. Reference is further made to Valmikis Ramayana to submit that Mata Sita also used to practise pardah. It is further pleaded that many Sanskrit plays would reveal that Hindu women in ancient India used to cover their heads/face and hide their beauty. 
57. In this regard, this Court notes that presently, the practice of facial veiling among Hindu women may be prevalent to some extent in some parts of India. However, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta or chunni, which the learned counsel for the petitioner has argued as a form of barrier signifying seclusion, is not correct, as in the modern times, the system of ghoonghat or dupatta or chunni is viewed as a symbol of propriety and respect towards others, rather than being a symbol of barrier or seclusion. Thus, it cannot be equated or used as a synonym to the word pardanashin. 
58. The learned Amicus through her report has also drawn this Courts attention towards Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, according to which King Janaka of Videha Kingdom had organised Rajasuya Yagna and had invited all learned sages of India to participate. Hindu woman, such as Gargi, a sage, who had participated in the debate, had won the same by defeating one of the most learned sages Yajnavalkya in front of many others. A woman saint, Maitreyi had also successfully debated with Yajnavalkya in open court. Thus, the women in Hindus, since time immemorial, were empowered.
59. As regards the reference by the learned counsel for petitioner to Sanskrit plays authored by Sudraka or Kalisada, in order to bring home his point regarding the women practising pardah/veil in Hinduism in context with religion, the same is not meritorious since plays are stories which may refer to an attire but not mandate of the faith for a woman to follow. Moreover, it is mentioned in the petition itself that these plays would indicate that women wore veils to cover their heads. There is no gainsaying that covering of head by women cannot be equated with covering the face by putting a veil or pardah and such women cannot be termed as pardanashin.  
60. As far as the reference of the learned counsel for the petitioner to Mata Sita (???? ????), in context of Ramayana (??????), is concerned, this Court observes that neither in the Ramayana nor in any of the ancient or modern temples of Hindus, Mata Sita has been projected or shown to be wearing a veil or a ghoonghat or pardah. 
61. This Court also holds that even the reference to the extract of Ramayana by the learned counsel is in isolation without context, and the following extracts from the Ramcharitmanas (???????????) would prove to the contrary:

I. 



II.




III.




IV.




V.



62. The above extracts from Ramcharitmanas adequately prove that Mata Sita did not wear a veil and therefore, even to refer to her as a pardanashin woman will amount to nothing but distortion of description of Mata Sita in the religious texts. Further, the Ramayana does not project Mata Sita as a weak woman and rather by shallow reading and without understanding the true meaning and concept of Ramayana, a person at times may feel so, as they would not have gone into the deeper depth and meaning of the concept of Mata Sita as to who she was and under which maya (????), she took birth as a human for a larger purpose of destroying evil forces and thus becoming instrumental in destroying evil forces through Lord Rama (????? ???). 
63. The religious texts of Hindus are not mere books, but as Hinduism itself, are a way of life which prescribe a way of life to those who believe in it to follow it, in its spirit. Further, by following their dharma (????) i.e. duty in different roles and relationships in the society, continue their journey to attain the goal of Moksha (?????) i.e. being one with the supreme power that the Hindus believe in. Even this goal is an individual choice, however, practising the dharma prescribed for every role in ones life is desirable. 
Hinduism: Religion vs. Dharma
64. Since the learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued and referred to the word dharma and the mandate of dharma to follow the practice of veil, ghunghat, pardah in the context of Hinduism to bring home his point that even for a Hindu woman, to wear the same was, and to some extent even today is, a matter of dignity, mandate of religion and is intertwined with issue of right to practice religion and religious practices, has forced this Court to dwell into the question of difference between the word, religion and dharma in Hinduism. Hinduism is Sanatan.
65. There is a difference between religion and dharma as understood in Hinduism. While practising a lifestyle, a profession and different individual relationships etc., each person is practising his dharma qua that relationship or profession or act. Thus, a different dharma is followed by each individual in his different roles whether professional or personal as understood in Hinduism. The word religion is different, thus, from dharma as understood in Hinduism. 
66. To give an example, in Hinduism, the same person will be practising his dharma as a son towards his parents, a different dharma as a husband to his wife, and a different dharma towards his children, siblings, society and nation. 
67. To give another example, a Court of law/judge may have its faith as X being born in a family having full faith in X and following its tenets, however, the Courts dharma as a Judge is to do justice to all individuals before it, irrespective of their faith, commonly known as religion or other considerations such as social or economic status in life which at no cost should waver. The Courts dharma as a Judge is not faith X but doing equal justice to all. 
68. This Court, therefore, is of the considered opinion that Hinduism does not mandate pardah for women, as suggested by the learned counsel for the petitioner, as in ancient India, there are examples of empowered women in every profession and individual lives with rights, and the ancient scriptures, the deities and the Gods have never been projected as wearing pardah or prescribing pardah to women as a mandatory practice religious or otherwise.
Sikhism
69. As regards Sikhism, it has been mentioned in the petition that in Sikhism, for instance, the turban, an article of faith, distinguishes Sikhs from the others. Sikh women who have traditionally worn headscarves (chuni) are now wearing turbans, much like Sikh men.
70. In respect of the aforesaid, this Court notes that in Sikhism, it is customary for women to don a dupatta or chunni for the purpose of covering their head, while visiting Gurdwaras, which symbolises reverence for sacred spaces. In fact, when inside a Gurdwara, every person is required to cover his or her head. Such practice of wearing a dupatta or chunni is common in Sikhism, but without any formal imposition by their Gurus, signifying the absence of a concept of veiling within the religion. The headgears are worn by Sikh men, and not by Sikh women, barring a few circumstances, however, the petition mentions that Sikh women are now wearing turbans much like Sikh men '' which is not true. Further, there is no concept of any veil or covering the face in Sikh customs and traditions, which could substantiate petitioners argument of prevalence of pardah system among Sikh women. 
Christianity, Judaism, Jainism
71. In the petition, only a few passing references have been made that many women belonging to Christianity, Judaism or Jainism are also pardanashin as they wear some form of pardah or veil, mandated by their religion. However, the same is unsubstantiated by any religious text, authentic proof or writing.
Islam
72. The petition mentions that there is a difference between hijab and burqa, and burqa is a word that loosely falls under the category of pardah or veil. It is stated that there are two verses in the Quran in which Almighty Allah talks about the issue of decency and hijab, which deal with hijab of eyes. Thereafter, it is mentioned that another verse talks about a woman concealing the head and then using the loose ends of the scarf to conceal the neck and the bosom. It is further stated that as per Quran, the Islamic dress code for women does not only consist of a scarf that covers the head, the neck and the bosom; it also includes the overall dress that should be long and loose.
73. Thus, as per petitioner, she is well-within her rights to conduct herself in accordance with the tenets of her religion, including her choice of dress, as protected by Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.
74. In this regard, this Court notes that the issue regarding hijab or burqa being essential religious practices is an issue which is pending adjudication before the Hon'ble Apex Court. Background of the same is that the Three-Judge Bench of Karnataka High Court in case of Resham v. State of Karnataka 2022 SCC OnLine Kar 315 had held that hijab is not an essential religious practice of Islam, and the same would not be covered under Article 25 of the Constitution of India. Thereafter, the Division Bench of Hon'ble Apex Court in an appeal against the said judgment of Karnataka High Court, had delivered a split verdict in case of Aishat Shifa (Hijab Case-2 J.) v. State of Karnataka (2023) 2 SCC 1, which is now pending to be placed before a Three-Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court for adjudication. However, even though the issue has yet not been decided by the Honble Apex Court, the petitioner has repeatedly mentioned in the petition that the right to wear a pardah, which is like a burqa/hijab, would be covered under Article 25 of Constitution of India. Be that as it may, since the issue is already sub-judice before the Honble Apex Court, this Court would not delve deeper into it. 

POLICING IN BHARAT: MULTIFACETED DUTIES & SOCIAL CONTEXT
75. Policing encompasses the multifaceted duties carried out by law enforcement agencies to maintain public order, enforce laws, prevent and investigate crimes, and ensure the safety and security of individuals and communities. It involves a range of activities, including patrolling, responding to emergencies, conducting investigations, apprehending suspects, and working collaboratively with the public to address concerns and build trust.
76. In the context of the preamble of the Delhi Police Act, policing is viewed as a fundamental mechanism for upholding justice, safeguarding rights, and promoting harmony within the diverse population of Delhi. It emphasises the need for law enforcement to operate within the framework of democratic principles, respecting the rule of law and protecting the rights and freedoms of all citizens.
77. It is crucial to recognize that policing is not tailored to serve the interests of any specific religious or any cultural community alone. Rather, this Court holds that it has to be essentially guided by the principles of impartiality, fairness, and reasonability. While respecting cultural sensitivities and religious practices, law enforcement agencies must prioritise the common good and uphold the law without discrimination.
Test of Reasonability and Compelling Public Interest
78. The test of reasonability serves as a guiding principle in determining the appropriate response of law enforcement in various situations. For instance, when dealing with individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as during arrests or interactions with suspects, the police must assess the circumstances and make decisions that are proportionate and justifiable. While accommodating reasonable requests, such as allowing suspects to wear basic clothing and ensuring their right to dignity as such is not violated, the police must balance individual rights with the need to maintain public safety and uphold the law.
79. In the discharge of their duties, the investigating agency is required to navigate the delicate balance between upholding individual rights and safeguarding compelling public interests. While individual rights are supreme, they may need to yield to the imperatives of public safety and security when necessary. However, it is essential to underscore that such infringements cannot be arbitrary or disproportionate; they must be grounded in objective criteria and serve a legitimate public interest. Thus, while exercising their powers, the police must adhere to the principle of reasonableness, ensuring that their actions are both necessary and justified within the confines of the law and respect for individual rights. 
Multi-cultural Land of Bharat & Policing
80. The increasingly muti-cultural nature of Indian society definitely has an impact on policing in Delhi or India. The complaint in the present case is about police officers, about their insensitivity in protecting the pardanashin women and not giving them enough time to wear the pardah as per their religion. 
81. The police as law enforcement authority has a vital duty of protecting the community from those who have no respect for law, who are in conflict with law, those who have no respect for rule of law and indulge in criminal behaviour so as to endanger establishment of rule of law in the community. The Police acts as watchmen for the community by preventing crime and bringing criminals to the fold of the criminal justice system. The police have the role of crime control, maintenance of law and order, and also are available 24 hours for a wide range of services to the community. 
82. Needless to say, crime prevention and control is the most vital role they play and the general public holds the image of police as those who prevent crime, who detect and apprehend offenders and protect them. Since the police personnel are crime fighters, the policing involves certain rights to them under Delhi Police Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure. While the success of policing depends largely on how the police personnel respond to their duties and to the community members, their treatment of the vulnerable while dealing with crime prevention measures, many a times comes under scrutiny. 

WHETHER THE CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK IS SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE IN QUESTION?
83. Since all the other prayers were disposed of in this petition, the Court is only dealing with issue of issuance of general directions to the police to sensitise the police force apropos the sacrosanct religious, social customs and practices observed by all the women who observe pardah either as a religious belief or as a part of their personal choice belonging to any religion, while keeping in mind the submissions made before in this Court that many women in different parts of the country and the world are Pardanashin. 
Present Day Legal Framework for Protection of the Dignity of Women During Investigation of a Criminal Case 
84. Various substantive and procedural laws in India have been designed to grant women certain privileges and considerations. The provisions pertaining to search and arrest of women, under the Code of Criminal Procedure aims to ensure that dignity of every woman is protected, regardless of them even being an accused.
Procedure of Arrest of a Woman
85. Chapter V of Cr.P.C., spanning Sections 41 to 60A, delineates the procedures governing the arrest of individuals. These sections provide comprehensive guidance on the procedure to be followed at the time of arrest. While these provisions bestow considerable authority upon the police for arresting individuals, they also impose reasonable limitations, particularly concerning the arrest of women. Law enforcement agencies are bound to adhere strictly to the stipulations outlined in this Chapter when affecting arrests, regardless of the circumstances.
86. Section 46(4) of Cr.P.C., introduced by the Criminal Amendment Act of 2005 through Section 6, lays down the fundamental procedures governing the arrest of women. It reads as under:
Save in exceptional circumstances, no women shall be arrested after sunset and before sunrise, and where such exceptional circumstances exist, the woman police officer shall, by making a written report, obtain the prior permission of the Judicial Magistrate of the first class within whose local jurisdiction the offence is committed or the arrest is to be made. ""

87. According to this provision, the arrest of a woman must be carried out by a female police officer. Moreover, it specifies that, ordinarily, no woman shall be arrested between sunset and sunrise. However, if the offence is serious or necessitates immediate action during this period, the female police officer must obtain permission from the Judicial Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the offence is committed or where the report is to be lodged.
Procedure for Search
88. The search of an arrested individual and his residence or dwelling is a crucial aspect of the arrest procedure. Sections 47 and 51 of Cr.P.C. outlines the process for conducting such searches, with specific provisions tailored for women. The search conducted by the authorities executing the arrest can be categorised into two main categories.
(i)	Search of Person
89. According to Section 51 of Cr.P.C., when a police officer searches an arrested person, any seized items must be securely stored, and the individual must be provided with a receipt detailing the confiscated items. Section 51 provides as under:
51. Search of arrested person.(1) Whenever a person is arrested by a police officer under a warrant which does not provide for the taking of bail, or under a warrant which provides for the taking of bail but the person arrested cannot furnish bail, and

whenever a person is arrested without warrant, or by a private person under a warrant, and cannot legally be admitted to bail, or is unable to furnish bail,

the officer making the arrest or, when the arrest is made by a private person, the police officer to whom he makes over the person arrested, may search such person, and place in safe custody all articles, other than necessary wearing-apparel, found upon him and where any article is seized from the arrested person, a receipt showing the articles taken in possession by the police officer shall be given to such person.

(2) Whenever it is necessary to cause a female to be searched, the search shall be made by another female with strict regard to decency.

90. However, the procedure for searching an arrested woman involves considerations of morality. As per Section 51(2) of Cr.P.C., if it becomes necessary to conduct a search on a female, it must be conducted by another female, ensuring utmost decency and respect for the womans dignity.
(ii)	Search of Place
91. When a police officer or any other individual executes an arrest or a warrant of arrest, they are empowered to search any premises for the subject of the arrest. The owner of such premises is obligated to grant unrestricted entry to the officer and assist them in conducting the search to the fullest extent possible. Section 47 provides as under:
47. Search of place entered by person sought to be arrested.(1) If any person acting under warrant of arrest, or any police officer having authority to arrest, has reason to believe that the person to be arrested has entered into, or is within, any place, any person residing in, or being in charge of, such place shall, on demand of such person acting as aforesaid or such police officer, allow him free ingress thereto, and afford all reasonable facilities for a search therein.

(2) If ingress to such place cannot be obtained under sub-section (1), it shall be lawful in any case for a person acting under a warrant and in any case in which a warrant may issue, but cannot be obtained without affording the person to be arrested an opportunity of escape, for a police officer to enter such place and search therein, and in order to effect an entrance into such place, to break open any outer or inner door or window of any house or place, whether that of the person to be arrested or of any other person, if after notification of his authority and purpose, and demand of admittance duly made, he cannot otherwise obtain admittance:

Provided that, if any such place is an apartment in the actual occupancy of a female (not being the persons to be arrested) who, according to custom, does not appear in public, such person or police officer shall, before entering such apartment, give notice to such female that she is at liberty to withdraw and shall afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing, and may then break open the apartment and enter it.

(3) Any police officer or other person authorised to make an arrest may break open any outer or inner door or window of any house or place in order to liberate himself or any other person who, having lawfully entered for the purpose of making an arrest, is detained therein.

92. However, the proviso to Section 47(2) of the Cr.P.C. stipulates that if the police officer or any other individual executing the arrest warrant becomes aware that the premises to be searched is the primary residence of a woman who, as per custom, does not appear in public, they must provide a notice to the woman informing her of her right to withdraw before commencing the search.
Whether the Petitioner has made out a case, Necessitating Issuance of any Directions? 
93. The central point in the present case essentially is whether this Court can identify any reason to take upon it, the role of an adjudicator to lay down directions to follow a certain protocol by sensitisation of the police force, which in the modern context and in the realm of practicality may not be legitimate. 
94. Of course the Courts have to be responsive to any contingencies and how those contingencies and situations affect the community at large, but at the same time, they also have an equal responsibility to consider whether the existing law, procedural, substantive or otherwise, is sufficient to ensure equal and just treatment to all equally placed.
95. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides for necessary safeguards as to how the police personnel are required to exhibit sensitivity towards the women, vide Section 46(4) and Section 60(A) of Cr.P.C. However, while investigating heinous crimes, to put fetters or roadblocks in their way of ensuring swift response to apprehending an accused during search of a place or a person would rather result in the accused absconding or the evidence being destroyed. 
96. In such situations, to burden the police, while carrying out investigation of a criminal case or apprehending accused wherein each minute is crucial, lest accused absconds or evidence is destroyed, will not only be impractical but also a dangerous proposition. Issuance of an additional direction to first inquire from a woman as to whether she is a pardanashin woman or she wears any form of veil according to her religious belief or customary practices, and then to grant additional time and notice to wear pardah or veil, in addition to following the safeguards already provided in law, on the ground of exhibiting awareness and sensitivity of the police will be inviting an accused to misuse the directions and utilise the time so gained, at times also on falsehood, to abscond or destroy evidence. 
97. To give a few examples, this Court frames the following illustrations:
Illustrations
(a)  Ms. X, a suspected terrorist is apprehended by law enforcement officers, and during the arrest, Ms. 'X' requests additional time to wear traditional clothing, citing religious or cultural reasons. It may not be considered reasonable by the authorities to afford time to Ms. X due to the potential security risks involved, as traditional clothing could be potentially used for concealing weapons or explosives, posing a threat to public safety, or the time so provided could also be used by Ms. 'X' to plan and execute an attack on the police officials.

(b)  Ms. X, who possesses digital evidence and is apprehended by law enforcement agencies, requests time to wear her religious attire. Granting Ms. X additional time in a premises not fully controlled by police officers can result in the destruction or distortion of digital evidence by Ms. X, which can be destroyed in a matter of seconds or minutes.

(c)  Mr. 'Y' is a suspect in a serious crime and law enforcement agencies arrive to conduct an investigation, Ms. 'X', a close relative of Mr. 'Y' present in the same house, requests time to wear religious attire. However, the authorities, mindful of the possibility that granting Ms. 'X' additional time could provide an opportunity for any communication or interference with the investigation, hesitate to fulfil the request. This cautious approach by the authorities may be deemed reasonable given the circumstances of the investigation and the need to preserve its integrity.

98. The fundamental requirement of some cases lies in the secrecy of conducting a raid to apprehend an accused or recover an object, currency, etc., and in case such a mandatory direction is issued, it can be misused to distort or destroy evidence and the very purpose of the raid will be defeated, compromising with the investigation of a case, causing serious prejudice to the investigating agency. In case, a case is based on cyber crime or retrieving or recovering of digital evidence, which can be lost at the click of a button, such mandatory protocol to be followed can be misused by a woman accused or a male accused having a female member at home by projecting that she is a pardanashin woman, though in fact she may not be.
99. While this Court maintains that sensitivity towards cultural diversity and equipping police personnel with knowledge, skill and attitudes to deal with females will be of utmost importance, at the same time, directing the police to act in interest of a particular gender in a particular way, which may be opposed to the interest of society at large, will be unjust. 
100. Any legal restriction in their way of investigation will affect their effectiveness. The police have to ensure execution of law while respecting human dignity and right of a person, and balancing the same with the need for social order and safety of the community. The Courts and the society have to recognize the legitimate authority of the police to implement and execute law while policing, though any excess committed by them in contravention of law will always be open to judicial scrutiny.
101. In case any such additional direction is issued, the police may find themselves not only entrusted with pressure of policing for enforcing law and crime prevention, but they may also be under constant pressure to be more cautious and lose precious time while apprehending an accused, in order to appear to have a sensitive gender and community based approach. 
Argument regarding Right to Dignity under Article 21 vis-a-vis Pardanashin Women
102. It is the case of petitioner that a womans right to wear pardah is covered under the ambit of right to dignity, which is enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution, besides Article 25 of the Constitution, which protects ones right to practise or profess his or her religion. Accordingly, the directions for sensitization of police officers qua pardanashin women should also be issued since the officers by their conduct violate the right to dignity of women who are pardanashin.
103. As far as this argument is concerned, this Court is of the opinion that the concept of dignity also, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution, extends universally to every citizen, irrespective of gender or any other characteristic. It is a fundamental principle that is based on the inherent worth and value of each individual within society. Article 21 guarantees the protection of life and personal liberty, recognizing that dignity is a fundamental aspect of human existence. The protection under Article 21 is also not contingent upon adherence to any particular cultural or religious practice, including the concept of pardah. Instead, it applies universally to all citizens, regardless of their beliefs or practices.
104. Thus, every human, whether a man or a woman, is entitled to the right to dignity, which is also available even to an accused or a prisoner. Also to ensure that dignity of any woman is not compromised, special safeguards have been provided under law, which have already been discussed in the preceding paragraphs. To this extent, the law is clear and the police officers are bound by it and they must remain aware of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure as well as judicial precedents, which put certain measures in place for upholding the dignity of women, while either arresting or searching any woman or while carrying out the investigation. When the law talks about dignity of women, it means all women, regardless of their religion, faith or custom. 
The Concept of Judgment Impact
105. The concept of judgment impact has also to remain one of the crucial ingredients and factors while writing a judgment since a mandatory direction to another authority may result into practical difficulties, and instead of helping in administration of justice and ensuring rule of law, may bring results to the contrary.
106. The judgment and the direction which is being sought from this Court in the name of ensuring freedom to practise any religion under Article 25 of Indian Constitution or dignity of women under Article 21 of Indian Constitution has the potential of being misused by a female accused, or a male accused and their female family members. It will also amount to presuming that a woman does not commit crime and cannot be an accused who needs to be searched, arrested or a raid be conducted to apprehend her. This Court cannot pass any such direction.
107. While observing so, this Court holds a view that a judgment adjudicating a crucial question of issuance of directions and sensitization cannot be purely an Academic exercise. Even an  academic judgment has to keep in mind as to whether it will invite difficulties in administration of justice, rule of law, and at all times, keep in mind a pragmatic approach so that the judgment does not become a road-block for law enforcement agencies, who may face contempt for non-obedience of the judgments and for fear of that, continue to face difficulties in performing their actual duties. The wide discretion that judges have, should be utilised for improving the interest of the country and the community while balancing the law and the rights of other law enforcement agencies to achieve a balanced merger of both. 

DIRECTIVES ISSUED BY COURTS: NEED TO BE JUSTICE DRIVEN AND NOT FAITH DRIVEN
108. Learned counsel for the petitioner had argued that the insensitivity of the police force in general towards the religious sentiments of pardanashin women, who may belong to different religions or faiths, is in the teeth of Article 25 of the Constitution of India which ensures freedom of practising any religion to an individual. 
109. Therefore, one of the issues before this Court was as to whether the directions sought from this Court to sensitise the Delhi Police and directing them to follow a protocol in view of the religious scriptures and religious mandate of women of different religions, is called for or not and as to whether in case a protocol is not framed for sensitization of police officers, will it be in violation of Article 25 of the Constitution of India.
110. In paragraph nos. 56 to 70, this Court has rejected the argument of learned counsel for the petitioner that practise of pardah is commonly followed by Hindu or Sikh women, and that there is no such mandate to wear a veil or pardah in these religions. 
111. As far as the practice of wearing hijab or burqa in Islam is concerned, this Court has already observed in paragraph no. 74 that whether such practises fall under the essential religious practice, so as to be covered within the ambit of Article 25 of Constitution of India, is an issue which is pending before the Honble Apex Court for adjudication, and there is nothing at this stage to prove that wearing a pardah, or burqa as called in Islam, would be an essential religious practice. 
Article 25 of the Constitution has arisen for the religions and not from the religions
112. Article 25 of the Constitution has arisen for the religions and not from the religions. While it enshrines the fundamental right to freedom of religion, it also delineates that this freedom is not absolute; rather, it is subject to considerations of public order, health, and morality. 
113. It is noted that the preservation of public order encompasses the broader need of upholding law and order across society, a duty in which investigating agencies play a pivotal role. Therefore, while individuals have the constitutional right to practise their religion, this right is circumscribed by the need to maintain public order and ensure the efficacy of law enforcement efforts.
114. Thus, while even criminals have certain fundamental rights, these cannot serve as barriers to their arrest or prosecution, except those rights which have been provided under law in this regard; rather, their rights have to yield to the interests of the state and public safety. It is the primary duty of both the Courts and the police to protect the nation and its communities, making it inappropriate to issue directives based on faith. Such actions exceed the powers granted to the courts by the Constitution and undermine the rule of law.
115. In police investigations, there cannot be any room for anonymity, as identification is essential for ensuring justice and maintaining security. Allowing anonymity under the guise of religious practice or personal choice could open the door to abuse and hinder the investigation process. Therefore, it is important that law enforcement agencies have the authority to identify individuals when necessary, in order to maintain public order, regardless of veiling practices and also regardless of the fact that whether these practices would be covered under Article 25 the Constitution or not. This would ensure transparency, accountability, and fair treatment of all individuals involved in the investigative process. 
116. In this Courts view, the directions issued by any Court must be rooted in legal principles, rather than influenced by religious considerations. Judgments should remain impartial and devoid of any religious bias, recognizing that criminality transcends any specific religious affiliation; it concerns the welfare of society as a whole. 

A JUDGES PURE FIDELITY TO THE APPLICATION OF LAW IN CONSONANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF MODERN BHARAT
117. A judge has to meet the critical requirement of its pure fidelity to the application of law for the larger community good and upholding the fundamental rights of every citizen. The judicial responsibility and the judicial obligation of living up to its fidelity to law also has to pass the test of practical standpoint of view as to what the Courts directions would result in. 
118. While at times, a judge may be tempted to find legalistic solution to a problem placed before it, however, the temptation has to be resisted since the directions sought may not only be impractical but also instead of successfully mitigating the alleged perceived injustice to some in a situation, may in fact give rise to unjustified fetters on the power to investigate by the investigating agency. The adjudicated law has to pass the test of being justified on the touchstone of procedural and substantive grounds. 
The Social Face of Law: Judges Role in Shaping Legal & Social Discourse
119. Undoubtedly, the judges are trained in law and schooled in precedents, however, now, law has a social face too. In the changing role of judges through adjudication of cases in writ jurisdiction, one finds greater involvement with social policy of the Court and judges. The judges rulings on social questions inarguably affect a large number of members of the community. However, such judgments on social policy cannot be segregated or be opposed to the legislations and the State policies which involve the safety and security of the country or the community at large. 
120. What distinguishes judges and their judgments is their impartiality. The nature of the issues posed before a judge for adjudication, and the expectation of a petitioner or the public at large, that those issues will be adjudicated fairly, represent one concept, and the need for judges to be sensitive towards a broader range of social concerns is another expectation.
121. Though certain legislations can be gender-specific, the judges, the judgments and the orders are always Genderless. The judgments are not only the thoughts or perceptions of a judge and are not limited to legal acumen of a judge alone, but also the work carried out through the legal acumen of the lawyers/advocates assisting the Court. 

WHILE CONCLUDING: SOMETIMES EVEN AN ISOLATED WORD SPEAKS A STORY
122. The word pardanashin conjures an image. When this Court uses the word pardanashin, it conjures the picture of a woman who is wearing a pardah and perceived as powerless and one who does not understand the worldly affairs, who needs someone to look after her legal, personal and other affairs as understood and defined in judicial precedents in context of capacity to enter into a contract. Whatever a Court of law writes, it has to remain cautious that it leaves an indelible mark and the philosophy flowing from a judgment is read by many to follow. This Courts responsibility would be many-fold when it is forced to enter the arena of ancient scriptures and interpret it and give a meaning as deemed fit by the petitioner or perceived by the petitioner in the modern times. 
123. Therefore, in this Courts view, the word Pardanashin by its mere mention conjures an image which is not confined to a word or a single picture itself but the entire journey of women in India which they have covered from being empowered, being free of burden of a veil, to the indescribable burden of a weightless piece of cloth called veil which was full of challenges, troubles and social struggles.
124. This Court has observed in the preceding paragraphs that the concept of Pardanashin women was not in the context of any religious observance, but purely in the legal context of contracts entered into by women, who were not well conversant with the worldly issues and remained secluded from the world at large. As observed already, the judicial precedents, including the one wherein the word Pardanashin was used as early as in the year 1925 in the judgment of Farid-Un-Nisa v. Mukhtar Ahmad (supra), refers to the meaning of Pardanashin woman in the context of entering into a contract and not in terms of her religious beliefs. 
125. While considering a question as to whether the concept of pardanashin woman, as explained by the petitioner, is relevant in modern times, this Court would only like to express that much water has flown down the empowerment path of woman in India wherein by way of their fundamental rights as well as rights available to them under other legislations, special provisions have been made with regard to empowerment of women, not on papers alone, but in reality ensuring that every girl and every woman is educated; those who are young, by being provided with schooling, and those who have not had the opportunity to be educated, there being adult education centres / Praudh Siksha Kendras. 
126. As far the context of present case is concerned, instead of using the word pardanashin, this Court would rather want to term it as women who observe a particular dress code in accordance with their beliefs and faith, since the word pardanashin in the past has been used in context of women who were not empowered nor were considered well conversant with worldly affairs and were thought to be incapable of looking after themselves on their own due to them living in state of seclusion. 
127. Sometimes an isolated word speaks a story and sometimes even a story in itself is not more than a simple word as the words used by a Judge in a judgment are forever. The moment this Court terms women as Pardanashin due to their gender in general, it will do more harm to them than empower or add value to their already existing right to dignity. 
128. Therefore, in the background of the above discussion, and this Court having taken note of the well-researched report submitted by the learned Amicus Curiae as well, holds and sums up the findings of this Court, as under:
1. The concept of pardanashin woman is essentially a legal concept, not in context of any religious practice, but in respect of capacity to enter into a contract.
2. As the concept of pardanashin women in Indian law essentially revolves around seclusion of a woman from the outer world and society at large resulting in their lack of understanding of societal affairs, there is less relevancy of this concept of pardanashin women in the modern era especially in the big cities considering the background and the lifestyle of modern women.
3. Since the learned counsel for petitioner had taken this Court through various religious scriptures to show prevalence of practise of pardah among Hindus, Sikhs, etc., the discussion made by this Court in paragraph nos. 56 to 70, inter alia on Ramayana & Mata Sita, and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, will point out the fact that neither the Hindu women practised any pardah nor was it mandatory for them. They always were empowered till a particular era, and the history will speak for itself regarding its causes when Hindu women were burdened with the weight of a pardah, which though weight-less, carried unbearable weight for a woman who wears it, which cannot be explained in words. Thus, to sum up, in Hindus there is no mandatory provision to wear veil or ghoonghat, or Hindu women being pardanashin by virtue of their religion. Same is the scenario in case of Sikh women. In India, however, everyone can make their individual choices.
4. Further, the law enforcement agencies and their investigations cannot be driven by religious practices but have to be community and safety driven.
5. The fundamental rights, including those enshrined under Article 25 of the Constitution have to surrender in favour of the safety of the country and the community irrespective of the gender of the accused, and in case of Article 25, the rights are subject to reasonable restrictions such as maintaining public order.
6. Faith based directions cannot be issued by this Court, for the police officers who carry out investigation in criminal cases, lest it affects their power to investigate as provided to them by law. 
129. This Court has also taken note of the fact that while seeking directions from this Court regarding sensitization of the police officials apropos the special procedure which should be followed in cases of women who wear pardah, the petitioner has also highlighted certain aspects which may be considered while sensitising the police officials. Some of these aspects, highlighted in the petition, are sensitisation qua already available legal safeguards in relation to the procedure which the police authorities need to follow in case of arrest of a person and search of a place, and training initiatives to the police officers in regards to the same. This Court, while considering the same, has already reiterated the procedure for arrest and search of place in the preceding paragraphs, which finds its mention in the statutory laws and has also been laid down by the Courts in a plethora of judgments. There is no gainsaying that all the police officers, while carrying out investigation in a criminal case, are bound by the laws governing the procedure for search, arrest, etc. which already encompass the safeguards for ensuring dignity of women. In other words, the powers of police are already subject to several reasonable restrictions imposed vide statutory laws as well as judicial precedents, which also include safeguards for ensuring dignity of all women. No other directions, including faith based directives, are called for in this regard.
130. The Courts are neither historians nor they can take the role of historians, however, if by way of a petition and its contents, the history or the religious texts are projected in incorrect perspective, the Courts have to answer the same by referring to the same scriptures or commentaries thereon on case to case basis without interpolating their own personal faith, morality, being judgmental about choices made by other woman, solely resting their findings on the true fidelity of the judge to law and the constitution. Therefore, there also arose a need to discuss the concept of pardah in the religions mentioned by the petitioner in the petition, at the same time, clarifying that religion and dharma are different concepts, and thereby dispeling and rejecting the contention that wearing a veil by a woman makes her pardanashin and that different religions (as per petitioner) prescribed wearing of veil as a mandatory practise. 
131. Why this Court felt the need to delve deep into the concept of religion, dharma and religious practices, in context of laying down any directions and examining as to whether non-issuance of directions will amount to continuing with violation of Article 25 of the Constitution of India qua certain segment of women, was due to the fact that such judgments and directions as well as discussions therein are often prone to misinterpretation and misrepresentation, which at times, may do more harm when passed in context of religions scriptures than good, and therefore, a detailed judgment in this case was passed.
132. Needless to say, the judges communicate with the public and the community at large through their judgments, conveying a social message and direction wherever required. Thus, given the critical impact of judgments on large segments of the community, they must be clear and unambiguous, leaving no room for misinterpretation to the detriment or disadvantage of any gender or community member. Thus, the judgment has to speak and be complete in itself.

BEFORE PARTING WITH THE CASE: SYNERGY BETWEEN BAR & BENCH
133. In many cases, the lawyers become the voice of the society at large which is presented before the Courts through a petition by an advocate and thereafter, given a meaning for the community by the judge, as judges themselves are products of the society. In cases where lawyers bring forward social causes and provide the judiciary with an opportunity to intervene, the resulting judgments often transcend individual interests. Instead, they serve as catalysts for societal transformation, addressing systemic injustices and fostering greater inclusivity and equality. 
134. These judgments, which are not solely focused on individual grievances but rather on broader societal issues, exemplify the power of the judiciary to effect meaningful change, however at the same time, not forgetting the contribution made by the lawyers working and sitting in the office or appearing in the Court through leveraging the legal system to advocate for social causes. It has to be mentioned and stressed that lawyers help create opportunities for judicial intervention that can lead to landmark rulings with far-reaching implications.
135. Whenever a petitioner seeks any direction, or relief based on faith/religion, it becomes critical and imperative that the hallmark of justice, which is being unbiased, treating everyone before it fairly, equally, irrespective of their caste, creed, gender, financial or other status or their faith or religion and protecting their fundamental rights, should be reflected in the judgment. 
136. In this Court's opinion, the personal perceptions of a judge or her faith or her opinions in life should never become the ideological backdrop of the judgments, she writes. 
137. This Court is also of the opinion that it is part of duty and sociological service by a Court of law to the community and country that it does not shy away from the pressing need of adjudicating any issue raised before it, howsoever contentious or sensitive, concerning the justice system without fear of being trolled, criticised, mocked and taken upon it as her obligation in the role of a judge.
138. The present case is one example of the above.
139. Thus, this Court expresses deep appreciation for the learned counsel who appeared on behalf of petitioner Sh. M. Sufian Siddiqui, for bringing this case before this Court, as well as the learned Amicus Curiae Smt. Manisha Agrawal Narain, who through her well-researched and elaborate report, shed light on various issues relevant in the present case.
140. In above terms, the present petition stands disposed of. 
141. Copy of this judgment be forwarded to Director (Academics), Delhi Police Academy, for the purpose of training and sensitisation of all concerned.
142. The judgment be uploaded on the website forthwith.

girls/victims, citizens of Uzbekistan who had been trafficked and forced into 
prostitution in India by the accused persons. It is alleged that some of the 
victims had been brought to Delhi via Nepal and some victims had been 
brought directly to India on a tourist and medical visa, multiple times. It is 
alleged that certain victims had been brought via Nepal and their passports 
and other documents had been confiscated in Nepal itself. W hile some other 
victims had been brought to India on tourist and medical visa ’s and as soon 
as they had arrived in India their passports and other documents had been 
confiscated by the accused persons. It is further alleged that the said victims 
had been m anipulated and brought to India on the pretext of providing jobs, 
but as soon as  they had arrived in India the accused persons had forced  them 
into the work of prostitution and sexual slavery. It is also alleged that when 
the victims had tried to resist wo rking as prostitutes, the accused persons had 
threatened them of dire consequences and had told them that since they had 
no visas, the police would catch hold of them and would put them in jail. 
Furthermore, it is also alleged that the victims had been sold to different 
owners during their stay in Delhi and had been used in sex rackets. 
However, the victims had somehow managed to escape and had reached the 
gates of Uzbekistan Embassy. It is also specifically alleged that when these 
victims had reached the s aid embassy two of the accused persons had 
reached the embassy and had kidnapped one victim at gunpoint. It is alleged 
that the said victim had been released by the accused persons when the 
victim had been contacted over phone. After that , the Uzbekistan E mbassy 
had handed over all the seven victims to Empowering Humanity, NGO. The

complainant had annexed the statement of victim girls which had been typed 
by the help of Google translator. Thereafter, the present FIR was registered.  
4. Learned counsel appearin g on behalf of the applicant states that the 
accused/applicant has not been named in the FIR and has been falsely 
implicated in the present case. It is further stated that the present applicant 
has been implicated in the instant case on the basis of disclo sure statements 
given by the co -accused persons and the chargesheet stands filed against the 
petitioner for offences punishable under Sections 365/370/384/506/109/  
120B IPC and Sections 3/4/5 of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 
(‘ITP Act’). The i nvestigation qua the present applicant is complete and no 
purpose will be served keeping him in custody. It is further stated that there 
is no evidence against the applicant to link him with the alleged offence, 
except the disclosure statement of the co -accused and that the same cannot 
be read in evidence against the applicant. It is further submitted by the 
learned Counsel for the applicant that the victims in the present case had ran 
away from the alleged NGO i.e., Empowering Humanity and thereafter 
anoth er FIR bearing No. 747/2022 had been registered for offences 
punishable under Sections 365 IPC in P.S Dwarka and after the victims had 
been traced by the IO of the case in FIR bearing No. 148/2022 all the 
alleged victims had been sent to Nari Niketan, Nirm al Chhaya, Nagar, New 
Delhi. However, out of 5 alleged victims, 4 victims had run away from 
Nirmal Chhaya on 04.04.2023 for which another FIR had been registered 
bearing No. 100/2023 at P .S. Hari Nagar , Delhi . This conduct of the alleged 
victims , make it c rystal clear that the alleged victims are not genuine victims

and had been tortured by the complainant /NGO rather than the accused 
persons. Therefore, considering the above submissions bail be granted to the 
present applicant/accused as prayed for.  
5. Learne d APP for the State, on the other hand, strongly opposes the 
present application and argues that the present case is not a simple case as 
presented by the learned counsel for the petitioner. It is vehemently 
submitted that the victims in the present case a re aged between 18 to 22 
years and are nationals of Uzbekistan. It is further submitted that as far as 
the name of the present applicant/accused is concerned, one victim ‘TO’ had 
stated in her statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C  that she was informed that 
her visa has been arranged by applicant/accused. Moreover, there is a 
disclosure statement of other co -accused person corroborating the statement 
given by victim ‘TO’ under Section 161 Cr.P.C. It is further stated that the 
allegations in the present case ar e very serious. It is also stated that charges 
have not been framed yet by the learned trial court and there are 34 
prosecution witness es to be examined and that there is a possibility that the 
present accused/applicant can influence witnesses and tamper with evidence. 
Therefore, prayer for bail be rejected.  
6. This Court has heard arguments addressed by learned counsel for the 
applicant as w ell as learned APP for the State and has perused the material 
placed on record.  
7. This Court notes that it is the case of the prosecution that 7 
girls/victims who are citizens of Uzbekistan had been trafficked to India for 
the purpose of prostitution and se xual slavery. As per the FIR, victims had

been trafficked to India either on tourist visas or medical visas or illegally 
via Nepal. As soon as they had entered India their passports and other travel 
documents had been confiscated by the accused persons. It  is alleged that the 
said victims had been brought to India on the pretext of getting jobs. 
Furthermore , it has been alleged that the accused persons used to send the 
victims to customers in Delhi and across other states for prostitution and if 
the victims  resisted the accused persons would threaten them of dire 
consequences. It has been alleged that the victims had somehow managed to 
escape from the clutches of the accused persons and had sought an 
intervention from Uzbekistan Embassy. It has also been all eged that while 
the victims had reached Uzbekistan Embassy two accused persons had 
kidnapped one victim at gunpoint from the embassy and it was only after a 
call had been made to the victim by the Embassy the accused persons had 
released her. Thereafter, t he embassy had handed over the victims to a NGO 
who is the complainant in the present case. The complainant had attached 
the statement of victims recorded via Google translation along with his 
complaint. Thereafter, the present FIR was registered under Sec tions 
365/370/384/506/109/120B of IPC. During the course of investigation , 
Sections 3/4/5 of the ITP Act had also been added since there were 
allegations of human trafficking. This Court notes that bare perusal of the 
FIR and chargesheet reveals that the allegations are very serious in nature.  
8. As far as the allegations regarding the present applicant/accused are 
concerned this Court has gone through the statement of victim ‘TO’ 
recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C wherein it has been specifically alleged  
 
BAIL APPLN. 4355/2023                                                                                                                Page 6 of 6 
 
that the present applicant/accused was the one who had arranged visas for 
her and that the accused persons had paid an amount of Rs 6 lakhs to the 
present applicant/accused to bring her to India. It is also alleged that, the 
present applicant/accused helped th e accused persons send the money earned 
from prostitution to Uzbekistan. Moreover, the present applicant/accused 
has also been named in a disclosure statement of a co -accused person 
whereby it has been alleged that the present applicant/accused helped them  
bring girls from Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to India. The applicant/  
accused had helped bring the victims through procurement of visas and if 
the same was not given to the victims the present applicant/accused would 
manage to facilitate the entry of the victims through illegal means via Dubai 
to Nepal and then in India.  
9. This Court notes that the trial in the instant case is at a very initial 
stage and charges have not been framed yet by the learned Trial Court. Also, 
there are 34 prosecution witnesses to  be examined who are prone to 
influence and pressure and , thus at this stage, this Court is not inclined to 
grant bail to the present accused/applicant.  
10. In view of the same, the present application stands dismissed.  
11. It is, however, clarified that nothing  expressed herein above shall 
tantamount to an expression of opinion on merits of the case.  
12. The judgment  be uploaded on the website forthwith.

CM APPL. 13042/2024 -E-hearing (Res.).   
1. This is an application for early hea ring preferred by the 
respondent.  
2. The application is, for the reasons stated therein, allowed, and 
the writ petition is taken up for consideration today itself.  
3. The application stands disposed of.  
W.P.(C) 10193/2019  
4. The present writ petition under Articles  226 and 227 of the 
Constitution of India seeks to assail the order dated 13.05.2019 passed 
by the learned Central Administrative Tribunal (the learned Tribunal) 
in O.A.892/2019.  Vide the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 2 of 5 
 allowed the OA preferred b y the respondent by issuing the following 
directions.  
“6. We are aware of the limitations of the Tribunal in 
the context of verification of correctness of answers to 
the question in the competitive test. However, as 
regards question no.56, we expressed our  
reservations about it, in OA No.580/2019. In that 
examination, it occurred as question no.44. Direction 
was issued to refer the issue to the subject  experts. 
Whatever happened to question no.44 in that 
examination, must happen to question no. 56 in the 
present examination also.  
7. Therefore, we dispose of this OA directing that the 
respondents shall take into account, the opinion 
expressed by the experts with reference to question, 
similar to question no.56 in the test conducted for the 
post of TGT (Sansk rit). If the answer in the final key 
for the said question is found by the experts as 
correct, no further steps needs to be taken; and if on 
the other hand, any different suggestion is made, the 
same shall be taken into account, for correction of 
anomalies , if any. There shall be no order as to 
costs.”  
 
5. In support of the petition, Mr. N.K. Singh, learned counsel for 
the petitioners submits that impugned order is liable to be set aside as 
the learned Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the respondent had 
approached the learned Tribunal after the declaration of the result and 
therefore the petitioners were justified in refusing to re -examine the 
answer key at his request. After some arguments, he does not deny 
that the answer to question no. 56 as provided in the answer key was 
erroneous as also the fact that the very same question was the subject 
matter of consideration in O.A 580/2019 and upon reference to the  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 3 of 5 
 Expert Committee, the answer key to the same was found to be 
incorrect.  
6. On the other hand, Ms. M amta Sharma, learned counsel for the 
respondent supports the impugned order and contends that that once 
the views of the Expert Committee were available with the petitioners 
and they became aware  after the order passed in O.A 580/2019  that 
the answer to qu estion no. 56 as published in the answer key was 
incorrect, they ought to have taken corrective steps on their own 
before declaring the final result. She, therefore, contends that the 
petitioner itself being responsible for the wrong answer key of 
question  no. 56 having been published, the respondent cannot be made 
to suffer  especially when he had approached the petitioner much 
before the final result was declared . She, therefore, prays that the writ 
petition be dismissed .  
7. Having considered the submissions  of the learned counsel for 
the parties and perused the record, we are inclined to accept the 
respondent’s plea that once the petitioners became aware about the 
answer to question no. 56 given in the answer key being incorrect, 
they ought to have taken  appropriate corrective steps on their own.  In 
our view, once the Expert Committee appointed by the petitioner in 
O.A. 580/2019, has expressed a categoric opinion that the answer key 
to the very same question, though with regard to a different 
examination for a different post, was incorrect and the answer given 
by the respondent is correct, petitioners cannot refuse to grant marks 
to the respondent for the said question especially when she had 
approached the petitioners much before the final result was declared .  
W.P.(C) 10193 /2019                                                                                      Page 4 of 5 
 Furthermore, we have also perused the question no. 56, the answer 
key whereto has been challenged by the respondent, and find that the 
answer to this purely mathematical question, as urged by the 
respondent is 7/75, i.e., Option ‘C’.  
8. In the light of the aforesaid, we find no reason to interfere with 
the impugned order which directs the petitioners to correct the 
anomalies after taking into account the opinion of the Expert 
Committee, which as noted hereinabove, clearly opined that the 
answer key to questi on No. 56 was incorrect. As we find that the 
answer, i.e., Option ‘C’, given by the respondent was correct, we 
dismiss the writ petition by directing the petitioners to grant one mark 
to the respondent as also to all other similarly placed candidates who 
had marked Option C, i.e., 7/75 as their answer to Question no. 56. In 
case, after awarding one extra mark to the respondent and other 
similarly placed candidates, the total marks obtained by the 
respondent or by any other similarly placed candidate are fou nd to be 
more than the marks obtained by the last candidate in the merit list, 
the respondent and such other similarly placed candidates will 
forthwith be appointed to the post of TGT (Sanskrit) by adjusting 
them against the presently available vacancies. It is, however, made 
clear that in case the respondent or any other similarly placed 
candidate is found fit to be appointed to the aforesaid post, they will 
be entitled to receive all notional benefits w.e.f, the date , the last 
selected candidate was appoi nted. They will, however, not be entitled 
to any back wages for the period prior to the date of actual 
appointment. The exercise in terms of this order be completed within

CM APPL. 13042/2024 -E-hearing (Res.).	
1. This is an application for early hearing preferred by the respondent.
2. The application is, for the reasons stated therein, allowed, and the writ petition is taken up for consideration today itself.
3. The application stands disposed of.
W.P.(C) 10193/2019
4. The present writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India seeks to assail the order dated 13.05.2019 passed by the learned Central Administrative Tribunal (the learned Tribunal) in O.A.892/2019.  Vide the impugned order, the learned Tribunal has allowed the OA preferred by the respondent by issuing the following directions.
6. We are aware of the limitations of the Tribunal in the context of verification of correctness of answers to the question in the competitive test. However, as regards question no.56, we expressed our reservations about it, in OA No.580/2019. In that examination, it occurred as question no.44. Direction was issued to refer the issue to the subject  experts. Whatever happened to question no.44 in that examination, must happen to question no. 56 in the present examination also.
7. Therefore, we dispose of this OA directing that the respondents shall take into account, the opinion expressed by the experts with reference to question, similar to question no.56 in the test conducted for the post of TGT (Sanskrit). If the answer in the final key for the said question is found by the experts as correct, no further steps needs to be taken; and if on the other hand, any different suggestion is made, the same shall be taken into account, for correction of anomalies, if any. There shall be no order as to costs.

5. In support of the petition, Mr. N.K. Singh, learned counsel for the petitioners submits that impugned order is liable to be set aside as the learned Tribunal has failed to appreciate that the respondent had approached the learned Tribunal after the declaration of the result and therefore the petitioners were justified in refusing to re-examine the answer key at his request. After some arguments, he does not deny that the answer to question no. 56 as provided in the answer key was erroneous as also the fact that the very same question was the subject matter of consideration in O.A 580/2019 and upon reference to the Expert Committee, the answer key to the same was found to be incorrect. 
6. On the other hand, Ms. Mamta Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order and contends that that once the views of the Expert Committee were available with the petitioners and they became aware after the order passed in O.A 580/2019 that the answer to question no. 56 as published in the answer key was incorrect, they ought to have taken corrective steps on their own before declaring the final result. She, therefore, contends that the petitioner itself being responsible for the wrong answer key of question no. 56 having been published, the respondent cannot be made to suffer especially when he had approached the petitioner much before the final result was declared. She, therefore, prays that the writ petition be dismissed. 
7. Having considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record, we are inclined to accept the respondents plea that once the petitioners became aware about the answer to question no. 56 given in the answer key being incorrect, they ought to have taken appropriate corrective steps on their own. In our view, once the Expert Committee appointed by the petitioner in O.A. 580/2019, has expressed a categoric opinion that the answer key to the very same question, though with regard to a different examination for a different post, was incorrect and the answer given by the respondent is correct, petitioners cannot refuse to grant marks to the respondent for the said question especially when she had approached the petitioners much before the final result was declared. Furthermore, we have also perused the question no. 56, the answer key whereto has been challenged by the respondent, and find that the answer to this purely mathematical question, as urged by the respondent is 7/75, i.e., Option C.
8. In the light of the aforesaid, we find no reason to interfere with the impugned order which directs the petitioners to correct the anomalies after taking into account the opinion of the Expert Committee, which as noted hereinabove, clearly opined that the answer key to question No. 56 was incorrect. As we find that the answer, i.e., Option C, given by the respondent was correct, we dismiss the writ petition by directing the petitioners to grant one mark to the respondent as also to all other similarly placed candidates who had marked Option C, i.e., 7/75 as their answer to Question no. 56. In case, after awarding one extra mark to the respondent and other similarly placed candidates, the total marks obtained by the respondent or by any other similarly placed candidate are found to be more than the marks obtained by the last candidate in the merit list, the respondent and such other similarly placed candidates will forthwith be appointed to the post of TGT (Sanskrit) by adjusting them against the presently available vacancies. It is, however, made clear that in case the respondent or any other similarly placed candidate is found fit to be appointed to the aforesaid post, they will be entitled to receive all notional benefits w.e.f, the date, the last selected candidate was appointed. They will, however, not be entitled to any back wages for the period prior to the date of actual appointment. The exercise in terms of this order be completed within eight weeks from today.
9. The next date i.e. 25.07.2024 stands cancelled.
10. The writ petition is disposed of in the aforesaid terms.

 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASMEET SINGH  
     
J U D G M E N T  
 
:  JASMEET SINGH, J  
 
1. This is a petition seeking the following prayer: - 
“It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Hon’ble Court may 
be pleased to issue the writ of mandamus, direction, order or any 
other appropriate writ thereby directing the r espondents to allot 
LIG flat bearing No. 93, Third Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela, New 
Delhi under the scheme NPRS 1979 on its old/previous allotment 
rate of 1994 (30.03.1994) i.e. the old date of allotment to the 
petitioner, in the interest and furtherance of justice.”  
Brief Facts  
2. The brief facts , which are undisputed, giving rise to filing of the present 
petition are as under: - 
3. The petitioner on 24.09.1979 deposited a sum of Rs. 15 00/- as a  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 2 of 14 
 registration fee for the allotment of LIG Flat under the Delhi 
Deve lopment Authority/respondent No.1 (hereinafter “DDA”) vide 
serial  No. 75777  as per the New Pattern Registration Scheme, 1979 
(hereinafter “NPRS 1979 ”) published by the DDA.  
4. The respondent -DDA issued a certificate  of registration in favour of the 
petitione r bearing serial No. 20201 for allotment of the LIG Flat under  
NPRS 1979.  
5. On 10.02 .1987 , the petitioner admittedly sent a letter to A ssistant 
Director (R), Housing, DDA regarding change of  his address from 
Railway Quarters , Narela, Delhi – 110040 to House  No. 296/12, Arjun 
Nagar, Gurgaon, Haryana  – 122001.  
6. The petitioner was allotted Flat No . 68, Pocket 6, Sector -A-10, Narela, 
Delhi  (hereinafter “Flat No. 68”) , but since the letter was sent  to the old 
address, the petitioner did not receive the same.  The allotment of the 
petitioner for  the said flat was subsequently cancelled.  
7. On 05.06.1995, the petitioner sent a letter to the Deputy Director (N.P.) 
LIG, DDA regarding cancellation of the Flat No. 68 due to non -
payment being without any fault of the petiti oner and due to the 
negligence of the office of the respondent Nos. 1 (DDA) and 2  (LIG 
Housing DDA) .  
8. The respondent  in a mini draw subsequently all otted another LIG Flat 
bearing No. 72, Sector -10, Pocket -6, 3rd Floor, Narela, Delhi 
(hereinafter “Flat No. 72”) to the petitioner on 31.03.1998.  
9. However, since the services in Narela were  awaited at that time , no 
demand -cum-allotment letter (“DAL”)  could be  issued to the petitioner 
in this regard.  Hence, the allotment of 31.03.1998 was only a paper  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 3 of 14 
 allotment i n favour of the petitioner.  It has been stated  by the DDA  that 
on 27.12.1996, the allotment of the flat had been intimated to the 
petitioner.  
10. The office of  the respondent No. 2 published a circular vide its No. 
F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/ 114 dated 06.06.2006 that t he principal of costing 
as laid down in the office orders No. F .2(10)02/Coord(H)/49 dated 
25.02.2005 with its amendment vide office order No. 
F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/Pt./22 dated 13.02.2006 applicable in the cases of 
missing priority and change of address will be  applicable in the cases of 
registrants of NPRS 1979, who had opted for Awas Sarkar Yojna but 
had not been identified as members of the society. These r egistrants  
would continue to remain members of NPRS 1979 and would be 
entitled to the allotment of preva iling rates at that time, when they were 
entitled for allotment according  to their priority,  if the registrants ha ve 
approached DDA  within a period of 4 years. In the cases  where 
registrants ha ve not approached DDA  within a period of 4 years, the  
registran ts shall be considered for  allotment of a flat at the old cost  
prevalent at the time when he/she was  entitled for allotment + 12% 
simple  interest till the date of issue of fresh  DAL or the  current cost 
prevailing at the time of  issue of fresh DAL, which ever is lower.  
11. On 30.01.2013,  the petitioner filed an RTI application to the office of 
Dy. Director (Housing) LIG regarding allotment of flat to the petitioner 
vide its registration No. 20201 and the department replied on 
20.02.2013 that the file in question is not traceable in the records , 
however, the department assured that best efforts would  be made to 
trace out records and required information will be supplied to the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 4 of 14 
 petitioner shortly.  
12. The petitioner, through RTI  (reply dated 12.09.2013 from the 
respond ent), was able to obtain information from the office of DDA 
that the DAL was issued at the old address of Railway Narela, Delhi -
110040.  
13. In the file noting of  17.12.2014 , the Director (H) , DDA  considered the 
entire dispute and directed that the DD (LIG) ma y examine the case in 
totality and give recommendations to finally resolve the issue in 
controversy.   
14. As per the file noting of  08.05.2015, the Commissioner, LA  (Housing)  
was of the opinion  that the claim of the petitioner  appeared  to be 
genuine  as the pe titioner could not deposit the amount due to non -
receipt of the DAL , the fault was on the part of DDA . 
15. The petitioner was subsequently allotted  LIG Flat bearing No. 93, 3rd 
Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela  (hereinafter “Flat No. 93”) under 
Registration No. 202 01 and Priority No. 30845  through demand letter 
No.118821 dated 10.02.2016 subject to the payment of Rs. 15,91,505/ - 
(calculated as per the new rates) before 08.08.2016, on which date the 
allotment was to stand automatically cancelled if the deposit was no t 
made.  
16. It is this rate of  allotment that the petitioner is challenging in the 
present writ petition , stating that the flat should be allotted to the 
petitioner on the previous allotment rate of 30.03.1994  (i.e. the date of 
first allotment to the petition er) and not the new rate, on the ground that 
it was not the petitioner’s fault of not  making payment for his allotment  
in the first place .  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 5 of 14 
 17. On 08.08.2016, when the petition came up for hearing, the respondent s 
were  restrained from selling or cancelling allo tted LIG Flat No. 93, 
Third Floor, Sector F, B -2, Narela, New Delhi subject to the petitioner 
depositing Rs. 4 lakhs with the respondent -DDA .  
Submissions  (Petitioner)  
18. It is stated  by the learned counsel for the petitioner  that it is the  
respondents  who did not  send the  first allotment letter  for Flat No. 68 at 
the right address . On the petitioner’s request, another flat was allotted 
i.e. Flat  No. 72, but the said allotment letter was never issued. Hence , 
the petitioner c annot be held liable for the delays caused  by the 
respondent s themselves.  
19. It is stated that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 cannot claim a new rate for 
their own wrong s, when they have  admitted  that it was their mistake. 
Thus, the petitioner is not liable to pay a sum of Rs. 15,91,505/ - for the  
fault of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, and it is the duty of the respondent 
Nos. 1 and 2 to allot Flat No. 93  on the previous allotted rate of 1994 , 
on which date the first DAL was issued.   
20. It is stated that the flats should be allotted by DDA to the registra nts on 
its previous cost if there is no fault of the registrants. For this, reliance 
is placed upon M.P. Nauriyal v. DDA 2015:DHC:2293.  
Submissions (Respondent)  
21. The respondent -DDA in its counter -affidavit has stated that the petition 
is barred by delay an d laches, as the petitioner herein has approached 
this Court after approximately more than 18 years. Reliance is placed 
upon the judgment in Banda Development Authority v. Moti Lal 
Agarwal , (2011) 5 SCC 394 .   
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 6 of 14 
 22. Ms. Nandadevi  Deka , learned Panel Counsel for t he DDA has stated 
that in the present case, the petitioner is at fault and did not take any 
steps towards  finding out the status of his allotment from the year 1998 
to 2013.  In addition, she also relies upon the circular of the DDA 
(Housing Department) dated 13.10.2011 which reads as under: - 
“1. In partial modification of Office Orders/Circulars issued 
from time to time regarding cost of the flats allotted under 
NPRS -79, Ambedkar Awaaz Yojna and under various policies 
of DDA like wrong address policy, missi ng priority, tail -end 
priority etc., the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the 
standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area 
rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand -
cum-allotment letter i.e. date when dema nd letter under above 
policy is issued.  
2. Old cases will not be opened i.e. it should be effective only 
from the date of issue.  
This issues with the prior approval of Competent Authority.”  
Analysi s 
23. I have heard learned counsels for the parties  and peru sed the materials 
on record . 
24. In the present case , the basic facts are not in dispute.  Admittedly, the 
petitioner was registered under NPRS 1979 and made the initial 
deposit .  
25. The DAL for Flat No. 68 was sent to the old address of the petitioner  
(despite ch anged address of the petitioner being available  in the file of 
the respondent ), and hence was never received by the petitioner. The  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 7 of 14 
 allotment was thereafter cancelled. On petitioner’s 
representation/protests, another flat was allotted to the petitioner bei ng 
Flat No. 72.  The DAL for the said flat was not sent to the petitioner as 
the services in Narela were awaited at that time. The same is evident 
from the file noting of the Director (H), DDA of 17.12.2014:  
“2. Sh. Bhgwan Dass was declared successful for allotment of 
LIG flat No.68, Sec.A -10, Pkt.6, Gr/II 3rd floor, Narela on 
30.3.1994. Due to 'changed address' applied vide letter dated 
10.2.87 duly acknowledged by DDA, the demand -cum-
allotment letter could not reach him , the allotment stood 
automatically cancelled.  
3. It is further seen that DDA considered his request and 
decided to allot him a  Flat through mini draw. He was declared 
successful for Flat No.72, SecI 0, Pkt.6,  Gr.II, 3rd floor, Narela 
in the draw held on 30.3.98. However, it was decided that  
before issuance of demand -cum-allotment letter, the status of 
services in the area  was sought from Executive Engineer vide 
letter No.F54(702)94/NA/400 dated   22.8.96. No reply to this 
letter is seen placed in the file. It is seen that Sh . Bhagwan  Dass 
has been agitating through various forms for early resolution of 
his grievance.”  
(emphasis supplied)  
26. In Mohinder Singh v. DDA  2011:DHC:2834,  this Court was of the 
view that the onus is upon the DDA to ensure that the DAL is sent to 
all available addresses of t he allottee, while acting in the interest of the 
allottee.  Consequently, it was directed that allotment be made on the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 8 of 14 
 amount of initial demand made by the DDA.  It was observed as under:  
“13. In the case of Hirdayapal Singh (supra), applicant 
(petitioner i n the case) had mentioned only one address in the 
application form, but subsequently he informed the DDA about 
his permanent address and the court was of the view that once 
demand letter was returned undelivered the DDA should have 
sent the demand letter a t all the addresses available in the file 
of the DDA.  To my mind the case of the petitioner is on a better 
footing as at the time of registering herself for allotment of a 
LIG flat the petitioner along with the application form had 
enclosing his salary cer tificate issued by the school where the 
petitioner was working, filing of a copy of the salary certificate 
was a mandatory requirement and thus has to be considered to 
be a part of the form. No doubt the petitioner has been careless 
in filling up the appli cation form and not providing his 
occupational address in the column provided, but the file of the 
DDA would comprise not more than seven pages, which 
include four annexures and two pages of the application form. 
The DDA should have acted in the interest o f the allottee, a 
common citizen, who has been waiting for more than two and 
a half decades for a flat in his name. In such a situation when 
the allotment letter was received back, DDA was duty bound 
to go through the entire file to ascertain if any other address 
was available and the demand -cum allotment letter should 
have been sent at the occupational address which was 
available in file of the DDA.  The common man must derive the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 9 of 14 
 benefit of the policy dated 25.2.2005 and in my view in the facts 
of the pres ent case , once demand -cum-allotment letter was 
received back to the DDA undelivered, the DDA should have 
carefully perused the file and ensured that demand -cum-
allotment letter is sent at all the addresses available in the file.  
14. Accordingly, petition i s allowed. Rule is made 
absolute. DDA is directed to issue a demand -cum-allotment 
letter in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks from receipt 
of the order with 12 % simple interest on the amount of the 
initial demand made by the DDA .” 
(emphasis supp lied) 
27. In the present case, the first DAL of Flat No. 68 was sent at the wrong 
address. The second DAL  for Flat No. 72 was never sent to the 
petitioner . Hence, the petitioner  at no point in time was in default of not 
making the payment as demanded by the respondent s.   
28. The entire defen ce of the respondent s is two -fold. First, that the 
petitioner did not follow up with the respondent s from 1998 -2013 , and 
thus his petition  is barred by delay and laches . Second, that  the plea of 
the petitioner is not maintainab le and is against the policy/circular of 
the DDA  dated 13. 10.2011 which has been reproduced above.  
29. Both the contentions of the respondent s are misplaced. As regards the 
first objection, the petitioner , on payment of necessary charges,  was 
issued certifica te of registration bearing  Sr. No. 20201. Once the flat 
had been allotted, it was the duty of the respondent s to issue a DAL 
crystallising  the amount due and payable by the petitioner  and in case 
the petitioner  does not make the said payment, DDA  would be very  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 10 of 14 
 much  within its rights to cancel the allotment made to the petitioner . In 
the absence of the respondent s issuing any DAL, which in this case was 
firstly, sent on the wrong address (in regard to Flat No. 68), and 
secondly, never sent (in regard to Flat  No. 72), the respondent s cannot 
be permitted to state that the petitioner  should have come to the 
respondent s and asked for a DAL. In my opinion, there is no inaction 
on part of the petitioner.   
30. The respondent -DDA  has relied upon Banda Development Authori ty 
(supra) to argue that the limitation period for approaching this Court 
has expired. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:  
“17. It is true that no limitation has been prescribed for filing 
a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution b ut one of the 
several rules of self -imposed restraint evolved by the superior 
courts is that the High Court will not entertain petitions filed 
after long lapse of time because that may adversely affect the 
settled/crystallised rights of the parties. If the  writ petition is 
filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing a 
civil suit for similar cause, the High Court will treat the delay 
unreasonable and decline to entertain the grievance of the 
petitioner on merits.”  
31. In the present case, there w as no cause of action for the petitioner to 
approach the Court prior to 10.02.2016 when the respondent allotted 
Flat No. 93 to the petitioner vide Demand Letter No. 118821 . The 
petitioner is aggrieved by this letter and filed the  present writ petition 
on 0 3.08.2016  on accrual of cause of action . The petitioner cannot 
know that there were two earlier DALs as the first was sent to a wrong  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 11 of 14 
 address and the second was never issued. Hence, the petition is well 
within the limitation period . Every effort must be ma de by the DDA to 
ensure that the DAL is issued at the right address.  
32. As regards the second objection is concerned, the circular is clear that 
in case where the DDA  sends the DAL at the wrong address, the rate 
prevalent on  the date of issue of DAL is the r ate that is to be charged by 
the DDA. In the present case, the first DAL was issued in 1994,  and the  
second DAL was never issued. Since the respondent s were rectifying 
their own mistake of not issuing the DAL,  they cannot ask the 
petitioner to make payment  of the value of the flat as per the rates of 
2016  i.e. when the Demand Letter No. 118821 for Flat No. 93 was 
issued .  
33. I am of the view that there is no fault attributable to the petitioner. The 
words appearing in the circular dated 13.10.2011 , “the cost o f the flat 
in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis 
of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue 
of demand -cum-allotment letter  i.e. Date when demand letter under 
above policy is issued ” has to mean the date when the DAL was first 
issued  i.e. when it was issued  on the wrong address  in 1994.  
34. There is a reference to th e 2011 circular in the judgment of  Subodh 
Kumar v. DDA  2019:DHC:432 , wherein a Coordinate Bench of this  
Court has observed  as unde r: 
“21. ….I may nevertheless mention that, prima facie, the 
stipulation, in the said Circular, that “missing priority” cases 
would have to pay the cost of the flat as on the date when the 
flat was actually allotted to the applicant concerned, may be  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 12 of 14 
 perilo usly open to challenge as arbitrary. It is difficult to 
understand how, if the priority of an applicant has been 
missed, the blame for which would squarely lie at the doors of 
the DDA – the applicant could be made to suffer by having to 
pay a higher cost f or the flat….”  
35. I agree with this observation. The earlier wrong address polic ies of the 
DDA  stipulate that where change of address was intimated by the 
registrant but was not recorded by DDA and thereupon the letters were 
sent at the wrong address and the allottee approached the DDA within a 
stipulated time , he shall be allotted the flat on the cost prevalent at the 
time when his priority matured and no interest w ould be charged. Thus, 
being in interest of registrants, the wrong address policy afforded the  
registrants the  benefit of not having to pay for the mistakes committed 
by a government body. If the interpretation of the  circular dated  
13.10.2011  as submitted by the respondent s is to be accepted, then the 
same would take away the said benefit from the registrants , which, in 
my opinion, is unjust. The respondents,  vide this circular, have 
attempted to shirk their  responsibilities even in genuine/deserving 
cases. However, since the circular is not in challenge before me, I 
refrain from going any further.  
36. DDA is dealing with State largesse  and cannot be permitted to take 
advantage of its own wrong. Once the DAL has been issued and the 
same has been issued at the wrong address, the respondent s cannot be 
permitted to charge a premium on their oversight/mista ke by charging 
cost of the flat on the date when the new DAL is issued.  
37. Hence, it is not the petitioner who was at fault in not making the  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 13 of 14 
 payment towards allotment of his flat. It was the respondent s who had 
misplaced the file of the petitioner, and also  did not send the letter to 
the right address  in the first place . As per the judicial precedents on this 
issue, the respondents were  required to take all possible efforts in 
making sure that the DAL reached the petitioner, and in the absence of 
the same, t he cancellation of allotment was untenable in law.   
38. The reliance of the petitioner on the judgment of  M.P. Nauriyal  vs. 
DDA  2015:DHC:2293  is well placed , holding that the petitioner’s case 
must succeed when the fault lies on the part of DDA. The operative 
portion of the same reads as under: - 
“25. Admittedly, DDA neither informed the petitioner about 
any pending balance towards cancellation charges to be paid 
nor gave any information that his name was not included in 
the tail -end priority list. The DDA has a lso not disputed that 
as per the policy/guidelines dated 21.05.1995 regarding cases 
where allotment was not made due to non -inclusion of the 
name of the registrants in draw, in such cases, the allotment 
shall be made in the next draw at the rates prevailin g at that 
time when the registrants would get the allotment according to 
priority position.  
… 
31. In view of the above discussion and the legal position, I 
am of the considered view that since the fault lies on the part 
of DDA, the petitioner must succeed.   
32. Accordingly, the respondent/DDA is hereby directed to 
allot a flat of the same category, if left out from the draw held  
W.P.(C) 6883/2016         Page 14 of 14 
 in February, 2008 or any other flat of the same category in 
Delhi, within six months from receipt of this order.”  
39. For the said rea sons, the present writ petition is allowed and the writ of 
mandamus is issued directing the respondent s to allot LIG Flat No. 93, 
3rd Floor, Sector -F, B-2, Narela, Delhi to the petitioner on the 
old/previous allotment rate of 19 94.

1. This is a petition seeking the following prayer:-
It is therefore, respectfully prayed that this Honble Court may be pleased to issue the writ of mandamus, direction, order or any other appropriate writ thereby directing the respondents to allot LIG flat bearing No. 93, Third Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela, New Delhi under the scheme NPRS 1979 on its old/previous allotment rate of 1994 (30.03.1994) i.e. the old date of allotment to the petitioner, in the interest and furtherance of justice.
Brief Facts
2. The brief facts, which are undisputed, giving rise to filing of the present petition are as under:-
3. The petitioner on 24.09.1979 deposited a sum of Rs. 1500/- as a registration fee for the allotment of LIG Flat under the Delhi Development Authority/respondent No.1 (hereinafter DDA) vide serial No. 75777 as per the New Pattern Registration Scheme, 1979 (hereinafter NPRS 1979) published by the DDA. 
4. The respondent-DDA issued a certificate of registration in favour of the petitioner bearing serial No. 20201 for allotment of the LIG Flat under NPRS 1979. 
5. On 10.02.1987, the petitioner admittedly sent a letter to Assistant Director (R), Housing, DDA regarding change of his address from Railway Quarters, Narela, Delhi  110040 to House No. 296/12, Arjun Nagar, Gurgaon, Haryana  122001. 
6. The petitioner was allotted Flat No. 68, Pocket 6, Sector-A-10, Narela, Delhi (hereinafter Flat No. 68), but since the letter was sent to the old address, the petitioner did not receive the same. The allotment of the petitioner for the said flat was subsequently cancelled. 
7. On 05.06.1995, the petitioner sent a letter to the Deputy Director (N.P.) LIG, DDA regarding cancellation of the Flat No. 68 due to non-payment being without any fault of the petitioner and due to the negligence of the office of the respondent Nos. 1 (DDA) and 2 (LIG Housing DDA). 
8. The respondent in a mini draw subsequently allotted another LIG Flat bearing No. 72, Sector-10, Pocket-6, 3rd Floor, Narela, Delhi (hereinafter Flat No. 72) to the petitioner on 31.03.1998. 
9. However, since the services in Narela were awaited at that time, no demand-cum-allotment letter (DAL) could be issued to the petitioner in this regard. Hence, the allotment of 31.03.1998 was only a paper allotment in favour of the petitioner. It has been stated by the DDA that on 27.12.1996, the allotment of the flat had been intimated to the petitioner. 
10. The office of the respondent No. 2 published a circular vide its No. F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/114 dated 06.06.2006 that the principal of costing as laid down in the office orders No. F.2(10)02/Coord(H)/49 dated 25.02.2005 with its amendment vide office order No. F.2(10)02/N&C(H)/Pt./22 dated 13.02.2006 applicable in the cases of missing priority and change of address will be applicable in the cases of registrants of NPRS 1979, who had opted for Awas Sarkar Yojna but had not been identified as members of the society. These registrants would continue to remain members of NPRS 1979 and would be entitled to the allotment of prevailing rates at that time, when they were entitled for allotment according to their priority, if the registrants have approached DDA within a period of 4 years. In the cases where registrants have not approached DDA within a period of 4 years, the registrants shall be considered for allotment of a flat at the old cost prevalent at the time when he/she was entitled for allotment + 12% simple interest till the date of issue of fresh DAL or the current cost prevailing at the time of issue of fresh DAL, whichever is lower.
11. On 30.01.2013, the petitioner filed an RTI application to the office of Dy. Director (Housing) LIG regarding allotment of flat to the petitioner vide its registration No. 20201 and the department replied on 20.02.2013 that the file in question is not traceable in the records, however, the department assured that best efforts would be made to trace out records and required information will be supplied to the petitioner shortly. 
12. The petitioner, through RTI (reply dated 12.09.2013 from the respondent), was able to obtain information from the office of DDA that the DAL was issued at the old address of Railway Narela, Delhi-110040. 
13. In the file noting of 17.12.2014, the Director (H), DDA considered the entire dispute and directed that the DD (LIG) may examine the case in totality and give recommendations to finally resolve the issue in controversy.  
14. As per the file noting of 08.05.2015, the Commissioner, LA (Housing) was of the opinion that the claim of the petitioner appeared to be genuine as the petitioner could not deposit the amount due to non-receipt of the DAL, the fault was on the part of DDA.
15. The petitioner was subsequently allotted LIG Flat bearing No. 93, 3rd Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela (hereinafter Flat No. 93) under Registration No. 20201 and Priority No. 30845 through demand letter No.118821 dated 10.02.2016 subject to the payment of Rs. 15,91,505/- (calculated as per the new rates) before 08.08.2016, on which date the allotment was to stand automatically cancelled if the deposit was not made. 
16. It is this rate of allotment that the petitioner is challenging in the present writ petition, stating that the flat should be allotted to the petitioner on the previous allotment rate of 30.03.1994 (i.e. the date of first allotment to the petitioner) and not the new rate, on the ground that it was not the petitioners fault of not making payment for his allotment in the first place.
17. On 08.08.2016, when the petition came up for hearing, the respondents were restrained from selling or cancelling allotted LIG Flat No. 93, Third Floor, Sector F, B-2, Narela, New Delhi subject to the petitioner depositing Rs. 4 lakhs with the respondent-DDA. 
Submissions (Petitioner)
18. It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that it is the respondents who did not send the first allotment letter for Flat No. 68 at the right address. On the petitioners request, another flat was allotted i.e. Flat No. 72, but the said allotment letter was never issued. Hence, the petitioner cannot be held liable for the delays caused by the respondents themselves. 
19. It is stated that the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 cannot claim a new rate for their own wrongs, when they have admitted that it was their mistake. Thus, the petitioner is not liable to pay a sum of Rs. 15,91,505/- for the fault of respondent Nos. 1 and 2, and it is the duty of the respondent Nos. 1 and 2 to allot Flat No. 93 on the previous allotted rate of 1994, on which date the first DAL was issued.  
20. It is stated that the flats should be allotted by DDA to the registrants on its previous cost if there is no fault of the registrants. For this, reliance is placed upon M.P. Nauriyal v. DDA 2015:DHC:2293. 
Submissions (Respondent)
21. The respondent-DDA in its counter-affidavit has stated that the petition is barred by delay and laches, as the petitioner herein has approached this Court after approximately more than 18 years. Reliance is placed upon the judgment in Banda Development Authority v. Moti Lal Agarwal, (2011) 5 SCC 394. 
22. Ms. Nandadevi Deka, learned Panel Counsel for the DDA has stated that in the present case, the petitioner is at fault and did not take any steps towards finding out the status of his allotment from the year 1998 to 2013. In addition, she also relies upon the circular of the DDA (Housing Department) dated 13.10.2011 which reads as under:-
1. In partial modification of Office Orders/Circulars issued from time to time regarding cost of the flats allotted under NPRS-79, Ambedkar Awaaz Yojna and under various policies of DDA like wrong address policy, missing priority, tail-end priority etc., the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand-cum-allotment letter i.e. date when demand letter under above policy is issued. 
2. Old cases will not be opened i.e. it should be effective only from the date of issue. 
This issues with the prior approval of Competent Authority. 
Analysis
23. I have heard learned counsels for the parties and perused the materials on record.
24. In the present case, the basic facts are not in dispute. Admittedly, the petitioner was registered under NPRS 1979 and made the initial deposit. 
25. The DAL for Flat No. 68 was sent to the old address of the petitioner (despite changed address of the petitioner being available in the file of the respondent), and hence was never received by the petitioner. The allotment was thereafter cancelled. On petitioners representation/protests, another flat was allotted to the petitioner being Flat No. 72. The DAL for the said flat was not sent to the petitioner as the services in Narela were awaited at that time. The same is evident from the file noting of the Director (H), DDA of 17.12.2014: 
2. Sh. Bhgwan Dass was declared successful for allotment of LIG flat No.68, Sec.A-10, Pkt.6, Gr/II 3rd floor, Narela on 30.3.1994. Due to 'changed address' applied vide letter dated 10.2.87 duly acknowledged by DDA, the demand-cum-allotment letter could not reach him, the allotment stood automatically cancelled.
3. It is further seen that DDA considered his request and decided to allot him a Flat through mini draw. He was declared successful for Flat No.72, SecI0, Pkt.6, Gr.II, 3rd floor, Narela in the draw held on 30.3.98. However, it was decided that before issuance of demand-cum-allotment letter, the status of services in the area was sought from Executive Engineer vide letter No.F54(702)94/NA/400 dated  22.8.96. No reply to this letter is seen placed in the file. It is seen that Sh. Bhagwan Dass has been agitating through various forms for early resolution of his grievance.
(emphasis supplied)
26. In Mohinder Singh v. DDA 2011:DHC:2834, this Court was of the view that the onus is upon the DDA to ensure that the DAL is sent to all available addresses of the allottee, while acting in the interest of the allottee. Consequently, it was directed that allotment be made on the amount of initial demand made by the DDA. It was observed as under:
     13. In the case of Hirdayapal Singh (supra), applicant (petitioner in the case) had mentioned only one address in the application form, but subsequently he informed the DDA about his permanent address and the court was of the view that once demand letter was returned undelivered the DDA should have sent the demand letter at all the addresses available in the file of the DDA. To my mind the case of the petitioner is on a better footing as at the time of registering herself for allotment of a LIG flat the petitioner along with the application form had enclosing his salary certificate issued by the school where the petitioner was working, filing of a copy of the salary certificate was a mandatory requirement and thus has to be considered to be a part of the form. No doubt the petitioner has been careless in filling up the application form and not providing his occupational address in the column provided, but the file of the DDA would comprise not more than seven pages, which include four annexures and two pages of the application form. The DDA should have acted in the interest of the allottee, a common citizen, who has been waiting for more than two and a half decades for a flat in his name. In such a situation when the allotment letter was received back, DDA was duty bound to go through the entire file to ascertain if any other address was available and the demand-cum allotment letter should have been sent at the occupational address which was available in file of the DDA. The common man must derive the benefit of the policy dated 25.2.2005 and in my view in the facts of the present case, once demand-cum-allotment letter was received back to the DDA undelivered, the DDA should have carefully perused the file and ensured that demand-cum-allotment letter is sent at all the addresses available in the file.
     14. Accordingly, petition is allowed. Rule is made absolute. DDA is directed to issue a demand-cum-allotment letter in favour of the petitioner within eight weeks from receipt of the order with 12 % simple interest on the amount of the initial demand made by the DDA.
(emphasis supplied)
27. In the present case, the first DAL of Flat No. 68 was sent at the wrong address. The second DAL for Flat No. 72 was never sent to the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner at no point in time was in default of not making the payment as demanded by the respondents.  
28. The entire defence of the respondents is two-fold. First, that the petitioner did not follow up with the respondents from 1998-2013, and thus his petition is barred by delay and laches. Second, that the plea of the petitioner is not maintainable and is against the policy/circular of the DDA dated 13.10.2011 which has been reproduced above. 
29. Both the contentions of the respondents are misplaced. As regards the first objection, the petitioner, on payment of necessary charges, was issued certificate of registration bearing Sr. No. 20201. Once the flat had been allotted, it was the duty of the respondents to issue a DAL crystallising the amount due and payable by the petitioner and in case the petitioner does not make the said payment, DDA would be very much within its rights to cancel the allotment made to the petitioner. In the absence of the respondents issuing any DAL, which in this case was firstly, sent on the wrong address (in regard to Flat No. 68), and secondly, never sent (in regard to Flat No. 72), the respondents cannot be permitted to state that the petitioner should have come to the respondents and asked for a DAL. In my opinion, there is no inaction on part of the petitioner. 
30. The respondent-DDA has relied upon Banda Development Authority (supra) to argue that the limitation period for approaching this Court has expired. The relevant portion of the judgment reads as under:
17. It is true that no limitation has been prescribed for filing a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution but one of the several rules of self-imposed restraint evolved by the superior courts is that the High Court will not entertain petitions filed after long lapse of time because that may adversely affect the settled/crystallised rights of the parties. If the writ petition is filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed for filing a civil suit for similar cause, the High Court will treat the delay unreasonable and decline to entertain the grievance of the petitioner on merits.
31. In the present case, there was no cause of action for the petitioner to approach the Court prior to 10.02.2016 when the respondent allotted Flat No. 93 to the petitioner vide Demand Letter No. 118821. The petitioner is aggrieved by this letter and filed the present writ petition on 03.08.2016 on accrual of cause of action. The petitioner cannot know that there were two earlier DALs as the first was sent to a wrong address and the second was never issued. Hence, the petition is well within the limitation period. Every effort must be made by the DDA to ensure that the DAL is issued at the right address. 
32. As regards the second objection is concerned, the circular is clear that in case where the DDA sends the DAL at the wrong address, the rate prevalent on the date of issue of DAL is the rate that is to be charged by the DDA. In the present case, the first DAL was issued in 1994, and the second DAL was never issued. Since the respondents were rectifying their own mistake of not issuing the DAL, they cannot ask the petitioner to make payment of the value of the flat as per the rates of 2016 i.e. when the Demand Letter No. 118821 for Flat No. 93 was issued. 
33. I am of the view that there is no fault attributable to the petitioner. The words appearing in the circular dated 13.10.2011, the cost of the flat in all the cases will be the standard cost of the flats based on the basis of the plinth area rate and land rates as prevalent on the date of issue of demand-cum-allotment letter i.e. Date when demand letter under above policy is issued has to mean the date when the DAL was first issued i.e. when it was issued on the wrong address in 1994. 
34. There is a reference to the 2011 circular in the judgment of Subodh Kumar v. DDA 2019:DHC:432, wherein a Coordinate Bench of this  Court has observed as under:
21. .I may nevertheless mention that, prima facie, the stipulation, in the said Circular, that missing priority cases would have to pay the cost of the flat as on the date when the flat was actually allotted to the applicant concerned, may be perilously open to challenge as arbitrary. It is difficult to understand how, if the priority of an applicant has been missed, the blame for which would squarely lie at the doors of the DDA  the applicant could be made to suffer by having to pay a higher cost for the flat.
35. I agree with this observation. The earlier wrong address policies of the DDA stipulate that where change of address was intimated by the registrant but was not recorded by DDA and thereupon the letters were sent at the wrong address and the allottee approached the DDA within a stipulated time, he shall be allotted the flat on the cost prevalent at the time when his priority matured and no interest would be charged. Thus, being in interest of registrants, the wrong address policy afforded the registrants the benefit of not having to pay for the mistakes committed by a government body. If the interpretation of the circular dated 13.10.2011 as submitted by the respondents is to be accepted, then the same would take away the said benefit from the registrants, which, in my opinion, is unjust. The respondents, vide this circular, have attempted to shirk their responsibilities even in genuine/deserving cases. However, since the circular is not in challenge before me, I refrain from going any further. 
36. DDA is dealing with State largesse and cannot be permitted to take advantage of its own wrong. Once the DAL has been issued and the same has been issued at the wrong address, the respondents cannot be permitted to charge a premium on their oversight/mistake by charging cost of the flat on the date when the new DAL is issued. 
37. Hence, it is not the petitioner who was at fault in not making the payment towards allotment of his flat. It was the respondents who had misplaced the file of the petitioner, and also did not send the letter to the right address in the first place. As per the judicial precedents on this issue, the respondents were required to take all possible efforts in making sure that the DAL reached the petitioner, and in the absence of the same, the cancellation of allotment was untenable in law. 
38. The reliance of the petitioner on the judgment of M.P. Nauriyal vs. DDA 2015:DHC:2293 is well placed, holding that the petitioners case must succeed when the fault lies on the part of DDA. The operative portion of the same reads as under:-
25. Admittedly, DDA neither informed the petitioner about any pending balance towards cancellation charges to be paid nor gave any information that his name was not included in the tail-end priority list. The DDA has also not disputed that as per the policy/guidelines dated 21.05.1995 regarding cases where allotment was not made due to non-inclusion of the name of the registrants in draw, in such cases, the allotment shall be made in the next draw at the rates prevailing at that time when the registrants would get the allotment according to priority position.

31. In view of the above discussion and the legal position, I am of the considered view that since the fault lies on the part of DDA, the petitioner must succeed. 
32. Accordingly, the respondent/DDA is hereby directed to allot a flat of the same category, if left out from the draw held in February, 2008 or any other flat of the same category in Delhi, within six months from receipt of this order.
39. For the said reasons, the present writ petition is allowed and the writ of mandamus is issued directing the respondents to allot LIG Flat No. 93, 3rd Floor, Sector-F, B-2, Narela, Delhi to the petitioner on the old/previous allotment rate of 1994.

3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser 
charges levied by the respondent -DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:  
“i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the 
nature of Certiorar i quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P -1) 
given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;

nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to convert the 
peremises bearing No. B -4/228, Safdurjun g Enclave, New Delhi from 
lease hold to free hold for which application was submitted in the 
year 1996 (Annexure -6);….” 
Brief Facts  
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioner s participated in 
an auction and being the successful bidder s, were allotted plot No. 228, 
Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter “said 
premises/plot”) on lease -hold basis.  
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 
28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent -DDA  executed a lease deed dated  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 3 of 13 
 18.08.1980.  
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the 
construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, 
first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction 
plan. The petitio ners are using the entire premises for residential purposes.  
7. It is stated that th e petitioner s are consultant s by profession . Petitioner 
No. 1 also runs a registered  Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, “SSI 
Unit”) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to 
Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.  
8. The petitioner s are running their office from UG -5, Som Dutt 
Chamber 1, 5 , Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep 
Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.  
9. It is also stated that the petition ers were using the basement of the said 
premises for storing some equipment which , according to the petitioners,  is 
permissible under the Building Bye-laws.  
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting 
the said plot from leaseh old to freehold.  
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that t he 
lease of the petitioner s was cancelled on 26.12.2001  due to the fact  that the 
said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the 
lease, thereby mak ing it void.  
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through 
various letters, no action was taken by the respondent -DDA to restore the 
lease or convert the said plot from lease -hold to free -hold.  
13. Hence , W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed .  
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C)  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 4 of 13 
 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied 
Rs. 1,05,31,041/ - as misuse charges  calculated on the basis of the area of 
109.48 sqm .  
15. It is this misuse c harge which is sought to be quashed by the 
petitioner s in W.P.(C) 143 /2012, who state that the area of 109.48  sq. m. as 
stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents.  
Submissions  
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the pe titioner that the 
cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground 
that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non -
application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not 
preceded by any show cause notice (“SCN”) qua any alleged misuse.  
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the 
respondent -DDA along with its counter -affidavit, the SCN pertained to the 
alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the  use of subject premises for the 
purpose of “Office/Store” of an entity “Electric Enterprises”, which was 
never owned/operated by the petitione rs. Further, the cancellation letter was 
issued on the premise of an entity “Deep Jyoti Electronics”  using the 
basem ent of the premises , which was again never owned/operated by the 
petitioner s. Neither has the respondent -DDA placed any proof in this regard, 
and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-
facie  bad in law.  
18. It is further stated t hat while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 
(informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002 ), the respondent -
DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit 
documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease -hold to free - 
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 5 of 13 
 hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of 
the DDA,  the respondent -DDA took precipitative actions without there 
being any reasonable justification.  
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the 
respondent -DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide 
letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 
15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003.  
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states tha t while the alleged misuser 
began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying 
upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA  dated 17.08.2008 in 
W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are 
expected to act r easonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the 
demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to 
unreasonable exercise of power , and hence must be quashed.  
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was 
running hi s professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and 
was only using the basement for storage purposes.  
22. It is further argued that the non -application of mind in so far as the 
demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as 
available on the file of the respondent -DDA. The entire calculation of the 
misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent -DDA 
was itself not clear as to the area under misuse.  
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot i s around 1800  sq. ft. As per 
the Building Bye -Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise 
for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the 
covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 6 of 13 
 respondent -DDA  has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within  the 
permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser , and the petitioner being 
a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled 
to this protection.  
24. Mr. Birbal, learn ed standing counsel appears for the respondent -DDA 
and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was 
cancelled.  
25. As regards the misuse r charges are concerned, it is the stand of 
respondent -DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy  
and deserve to be upheld.  
Analysis  
26. I have heard learned counsel s for the parties.  
On Cancellation of Lease Deed  
27. In the counter -affidavit filed by the respondent -DDA , it has been 
stated that there are multiple  show  cause notices issued and at lea st 9 
inspections conducted by the respondent -DDA . Despite this,  only one SCN  
has been annexed  by the respondent i.e. the SCN  dated 11/15.05.1987.  
28. It was observed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies 
(P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India , (2021) 2 S CC 551  
“13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of 
civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is 
sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected 
should be given a reasonable opportunity to def end himself. The basic 
principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the 
authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the 
case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 7 of 13 
 adequate and the grounds  necessitating action and the penalty/action 
proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An 
order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and 
without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in  Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian Gener al, Evacuee Property  [Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has 
held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds 
on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable 
the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not 
satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any 
reasonable opportunity of being heard. ” 
29. A perusal of the said SCN  clearly shows that the same is vague and 
devoid of any details.  It states that the basement is being misused contrary to 
the terms and conditions of the lease.  It also does not specify  the area that is 
being misused , and further  mentions that the plot is being used as an 
office/store for the entity „Electric Enterprises‟  (which, as per the petitioner, 
is not owned/operated by him ). Truecopy of the  SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is 
reproduced herein under :-

30. A perusal of the office noting further shows that the respondent DDA 
itself is taking conflicting stance with regard to area b eing misused and its 
purpose , the details of which are as under :

109.48 sq. mtrs., and as per the 2002 
report is 12.71 sq. mtrs.  
- Respondent after going through the 
entire note sheets and assessment of 
area under misuse gives a finding that 
misuse area charges are leviable for 
an area of 19.34 sq. mts. w .e.f. 
15.01.1986 to 28.06.1999.  Pg.144 -145 
  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 11 of 13 
 31. At times, the respondent -DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to 
use the basement for the purposes  it was being used and at times that an area 
of 12.7 1 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the res pondent states 
that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations 
that the area under misuse is  19.34  sq. meters , and at times that the area 
under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters . 
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that t he respondent -DDA 
itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitione rs. 
33. Since the respondent -DDA  itself is unclear about t he area under 
misuse despite stating to have conducted numerous inspections, the SCN  
itself is vague and devoid  of the specifications of the area that is under 
misuse.  
34. The acts of the respondent -DDA is not preceded by a proper SCN 
informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no 
hearing was given to the petitioner and  despite the same,  his lea se was 
cancelled.  
35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation  of the lease 
deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B -4, Safdarjung 
Enclave, New Delhi is faulty and violates  Principals of Natural Justice.  
36. The writ petition is a llowed and the  cancellation letter  dated 
02.01.2002 is hereby set aside.  
On Misuser Charges  
37. The next question that  arises for my consideration is if there was any 
misuser and the amount to be charged for that misuser.  
38. A perusal of the writ petition of the petitioner itself shows that the 
petitioner admits that an area of 12.71 sq. meter s was being misused  as  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 12 of 13 
 storage.  
39. The same , admittedly , is contrary to the master plan, the zonal 
development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause 
II(13 ) of the lease deed  which reads as under:  
“(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor 
carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any 
building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or 
permit t he same to be used for any purpose other than that of private 
dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing 
whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, 
annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the 
neighbourhood.  
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said 
Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that 
of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such 
terms and conditions, including payment of ad ditional premium and 
additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion 
determine.  
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has 
been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for 
storage/office purpose.  Hence, for an area of 19 .34 sq. meter s, the misuser 
charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.  
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his 
client who is present in Court, is agreeable to  payment  of those charges from 
15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.  
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 13 of 13 
 misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986  till the date 
of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner 
shall make the said payment along with restoration charges , if any,  within 6 
weeks thereafter.  
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the 
application of the petitioner for conversion from lease -hold to free -hold shall 
also be de cided  by the respondent -DDA in accordance with law.   
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.  
45. Needless to add, in case the petitioner  is aggrieved by any further 
action of the respondent pursuant to the orders passed today, the petitioner  
will be at liberty to challeng e the same in accordance with law.  
46. With these directions, the petitions are disposed of.  
47. Pending applications, if any, are hereby disposed of.

1. These are writ petitions filed by the petitioners seeking relief against the respondent-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter DDA). Since these petitions raise somewhat identical issues, they are being heard and disposed of by a common order. 
2. W.P.(C) 15655/2004 has been filed seeking the following substantial prayers:
i) to direct a writ of certiorari thereby quashing the letter dated 2/1/2002 whereby the lease of the premises bearing No. B-2/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi was illegally and arbitrarily cancelled by the respondents;
ii) to direct a writ of mandamus thereby directing the respondents to convert the premises bearing No.B-4/228, Safdurjung Enclave from lease hold to free hold;

3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser charges levied by the respondent-DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:
i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the nature of Certiorari quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P-1) given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;

Brief Facts
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioners participated in an auction and being the successful bidders, were allotted plot No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter said premises/plot) on lease-hold basis.
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent-DDA executed a lease deed dated 18.08.1980.
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction plan. The petitioners are using the entire premises for residential purposes. 
7. It is stated that the petitioners are consultants by profession. Petitioner No. 1 also runs a registered Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, SSI Unit) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.
8. The petitioners are running their office from UG-5, Som Dutt Chamber 1, 5, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.
9. It is also stated that the petitioners were using the basement of the said premises for storing some equipment which, according to the petitioners, is permissible under the Building Bye-laws.
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting the said plot from leasehold to freehold. 
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that the lease of the petitioners was cancelled on 26.12.2001 due to the fact that the said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease, thereby making it void. 
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through various letters, no action was taken by the respondent-DDA to restore the lease or convert the said plot from lease-hold to free-hold. 
13. Hence, W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed. 
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C) 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied Rs. 1,05,31,041/- as misuse charges calculated on the basis of the area of 109.48 sqm. 
15. It is this misuse charge which is sought to be quashed by the petitioners in W.P.(C) 143/2012, who state that the area of 109.48 sq. m. as stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents. 
Submissions
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non-application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not preceded by any show cause notice (SCN) qua any alleged misuse. 
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the respondent-DDA along with its counter-affidavit, the SCN pertained to the alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the use of subject premises for the purpose of Office/Store of an entity Electric Enterprises, which was never owned/operated by the petitioners. Further, the cancellation letter was issued on the premise of an entity Deep Jyoti Electronics using the basement of the premises, which was again never owned/operated by the petitioners. Neither has the respondent-DDA placed any proof in this regard, and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-facie bad in law. 
18. It is further stated that while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 (informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002), the respondent-DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease-hold to free-hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of the DDA, the respondent-DDA took precipitative actions without there being any reasonable justification. 
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the respondent-DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003. 
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that while the alleged misuser began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA dated 17.08.2008 in W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are expected to act reasonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to unreasonable exercise of power, and hence must be quashed. 
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was running his professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and was only using the basement for storage purposes. 
22. It is further argued that the non-application of mind in so far as the demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as available on the file of the respondent-DDA. The entire calculation of the misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent-DDA was itself not clear as to the area under misuse. 
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot is around 1800 sq. ft. As per the Building Bye-Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the respondent-DDA has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within the permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser, and the petitioner being a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled to this protection. 
24. Mr. Birbal, learned standing counsel appears for the respondent-DDA and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was cancelled.
25. As regards the misuser charges are concerned, it is the stand of respondent-DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy and deserve to be upheld.
Analysis
26. I have heard learned counsels for the parties.
On Cancellation of Lease Deed
27. In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent-DDA, it has been stated that there are multiple show cause notices issued and at least 9 inspections conducted by the respondent-DDA. Despite this, only one SCN has been annexed by the respondent i.e. the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987. 
28. It was observed by the Honble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India, (2021) 2 SCC 551
13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected should be given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The basic principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be adequate and the grounds necessitating action and the penalty/action proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property [Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any reasonable opportunity of being heard.
29. A perusal of the said SCN clearly shows that the same is vague and devoid of any details. It states that the basement is being misused contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease. It also does not specify the area that is being misused, and further mentions that the plot is being used as an office/store for the entity Electric Enterprises (which, as per the petitioner, is not owned/operated by him). Truecopy of the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is reproduced herein under:-


30. A perusal of the office noting further shows that the respondent DDA itself is taking conflicting stance with regard to area being misused and its purpose, the details of which are as under:

- Respondent after going through the entire note sheets and assessment of area under misuse gives a finding that misuse area charges are leviable for an area of 19.34 sq. mts. w.e.f. 15.01.1986 to 28.06.1999.
Pg.144-145

31. At times, the respondent-DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to use the basement for the purposes it was being used and at times that an area of 12.71 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the respondent states that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations that the area under misuse is 19.34 sq. meters, and at times that the area under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters.
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that the respondent-DDA itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitioners.
33. Since the respondent-DDA itself is unclear about the area under misuse despite stating to have conducted numerous inspections, the SCN itself is vague and devoid of the specifications of the area that is under misuse.
34. The acts of the respondent-DDA is not preceded by a proper SCN informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no hearing was given to the petitioner and despite the same, his lease was cancelled.
35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation of the lease deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is faulty and violates Principals of Natural Justice.
36. The writ petition is allowed and the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is hereby set aside.
On Misuser Charges
37. The next question that arises for my consideration is if there was any misuser and the amount to be charged for that misuser.
38. A perusal of the writ petition of the petitioner itself shows that the petitioner admits that an area of 12.71 sq. meters was being misused as storage.
39. The same, admittedly, is contrary to the master plan, the zonal development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause II(13) of the lease deed which reads as under:
(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or permit the same to be used for any purpose other than that of private dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the neighbourhood.
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such terms and conditions, including payment of additional premium and additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion determine. 
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for storage/office purpose. Hence, for an area of 19.34 sq. meters, the misuser charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his client who is present in Court, is agreeable to payment of those charges from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner shall make the said payment along with restoration charges, if any, within 6 weeks thereafter.
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the application of the petitioner for conversion from lease-hold to free-hold shall also be decided by the respondent-DDA in accordance with law.	
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.
45. Needless to add, in case the petitioner is aggrieved by any further action of the respondent pursuant to the orders passed today, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge the same in accordance with law.
46. With these directions, the petitions are disposed of. 
47. Pending applications, if any, are hereby disposed of.

 CORAM:  
 HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JASMEET SINGH  
: JASMEET SINGH, J ( ORAL ) 
1. These are writ petitions filed by the petitioners seeking relief against  
the respondent -Delhi Development Au thority (hereinafter “DDA”). Since 
these petitions  raise somewhat identical issues, they are being heard and 
disposed of by a common order.  
2. W.P.(C) 15655/2004 has been filed seeking the following substantial 
prayers:  
“i) to direct a writ of certiorari the reby quashing the letter dated  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 2 of 13 
 2/1/2002 whereby the lease of the premises bearing No. B -2/228, 
Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi was illegally and arbitrarily cancelled 
by the respondents;  
ii) to direct a writ of mandamus thereby directing the respondents to 
convert the premises bearing No.B -4/228, Safdurjung Enclave from 
lease hold to free hold;  
iii) to direct the respondents to not to levy any misuse charges on the 
petitioners as there is no misuse of the premises bearing No.B - 4/228, 
Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi by the petitioners; .…” 
3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser 
charges levied by the respondent -DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:  
“i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the 
nature of Certiorar i quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P -1) 
given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;  
ii) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the 
nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to convert the 
peremises bearing No. B -4/228, Safdurjun g Enclave, New Delhi from 
lease hold to free hold for which application was submitted in the 
year 1996 (Annexure -6);….” 
Brief Facts  
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioner s participated in 
an auction and being the successful bidder s, were allotted plot No. 228, 
Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter “said 
premises/plot”) on lease -hold basis.  
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 
28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent -DDA  executed a lease deed dated  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 3 of 13 
 18.08.1980.  
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the 
construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, 
first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction 
plan. The petitio ners are using the entire premises for residential purposes.  
7. It is stated that th e petitioner s are consultant s by profession . Petitioner 
No. 1 also runs a registered  Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, “SSI 
Unit”) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to 
Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.  
8. The petitioner s are running their office from UG -5, Som Dutt 
Chamber 1, 5 , Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep 
Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.  
9. It is also stated that the petition ers were using the basement of the said 
premises for storing some equipment which , according to the petitioners,  is 
permissible under the Building Bye-laws.  
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting 
the said plot from leaseh old to freehold.  
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that t he 
lease of the petitioner s was cancelled on 26.12.2001  due to the fact  that the 
said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the 
lease, thereby mak ing it void.  
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through 
various letters, no action was taken by the respondent -DDA to restore the 
lease or convert the said plot from lease -hold to free -hold.  
13. Hence , W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed .  
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C)  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 4 of 13 
 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied 
Rs. 1,05,31,041/ - as misuse charges  calculated on the basis of the area of 
109.48 sqm .  
15. It is this misuse c harge which is sought to be quashed by the 
petitioner s in W.P.(C) 143 /2012, who state that the area of 109.48  sq. m. as 
stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents.  
Submissions  
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the pe titioner that the 
cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground 
that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non -
application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not 
preceded by any show cause notice (“SCN”) qua any alleged misuse.  
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the 
respondent -DDA along with its counter -affidavit, the SCN pertained to the 
alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the  use of subject premises for the 
purpose of “Office/Store” of an entity “Electric Enterprises”, which was 
never owned/operated by the petitione rs. Further, the cancellation letter was 
issued on the premise of an entity “Deep Jyoti Electronics”  using the 
basem ent of the premises , which was again never owned/operated by the 
petitioner s. Neither has the respondent -DDA placed any proof in this regard, 
and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-
facie  bad in law.  
18. It is further stated t hat while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 
(informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002 ), the respondent -
DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit 
documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease -hold to free - 
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 5 of 13 
 hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of 
the DDA,  the respondent -DDA took precipitative actions without there 
being any reasonable justification.  
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the 
respondent -DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide 
letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 
15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003.  
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states tha t while the alleged misuser 
began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying 
upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA  dated 17.08.2008 in 
W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are 
expected to act r easonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the 
demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to 
unreasonable exercise of power , and hence must be quashed.  
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was 
running hi s professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and 
was only using the basement for storage purposes.  
22. It is further argued that the non -application of mind in so far as the 
demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as 
available on the file of the respondent -DDA. The entire calculation of the 
misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent -DDA 
was itself not clear as to the area under misuse.  
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot i s around 1800  sq. ft. As per 
the Building Bye -Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise 
for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the 
covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 6 of 13 
 respondent -DDA  has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within  the 
permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser , and the petitioner being 
a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled 
to this protection.  
24. Mr. Birbal, learn ed standing counsel appears for the respondent -DDA 
and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was 
cancelled.  
25. As regards the misuse r charges are concerned, it is the stand of 
respondent -DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy  
and deserve to be upheld.  
Analysis  
26. I have heard learned counsel s for the parties.  
On Cancellation of Lease Deed  
27. In the counter -affidavit filed by the respondent -DDA , it has been 
stated that there are multiple  show  cause notices issued and at lea st 9 
inspections conducted by the respondent -DDA . Despite this,  only one SCN  
has been annexed  by the respondent i.e. the SCN  dated 11/15.05.1987.  
28. It was observed by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies 
(P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India , (2021) 2 S CC 551  
“13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of 
civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is 
sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected 
should be given a reasonable opportunity to def end himself. The basic 
principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the 
authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the 
case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 7 of 13 
 adequate and the grounds  necessitating action and the penalty/action 
proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An 
order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and 
without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in  Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian Gener al, Evacuee Property  [Nasir 
Ahmad  v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has 
held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds 
on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable 
the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not 
satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any 
reasonable opportunity of being heard. ” 
29. A perusal of the said SCN  clearly shows that the same is vague and 
devoid of any details.  It states that the basement is being misused contrary to 
the terms and conditions of the lease.  It also does not specify  the area that is 
being misused , and further  mentions that the plot is being used as an 
office/store for the entity „Electric Enterprises‟  (which, as per the petitioner, 
is not owned/operated by him ). Truecopy of the  SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is

 31. At times, the respondent -DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to 
use the basement for the purposes  it was being used and at times that an area 
of 12.7 1 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the res pondent states 
that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations 
that the area under misuse is  19.34  sq. meters , and at times that the area 
under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters . 
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that t he respondent -DDA 
itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitione rs.

informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no 
hearing was given to the petitioner and  despite the same,  his lea se was

35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation  of the lease 
deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B -4, Safdarjung

36. The writ petition is a llowed and the  cancellation letter  dated

39. The same , admittedly , is contrary to the master plan, the zonal 
development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause 
II(13 ) of the lease deed  which reads as under:  
“(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor 
carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any 
building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or 
permit t he same to be used for any purpose other than that of private 
dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing 
whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, 
annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the 
neighbourhood.  
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said 
Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that 
of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such 
terms and conditions, including payment of ad ditional premium and 
additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion 
determine.  
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has 
been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for 
storage/office purpose.  Hence, for an area of 19 .34 sq. meter s, the misuser 
charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.  
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his 
client who is present in Court, is agreeable to  payment  of those charges from 
15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.  
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of  
W.P.(C) 15655 /2004   & W.P.(C) 143/2012        Page 13 of 13 
 misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986  till the date 
of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner 
shall make the said payment along with restoration charges , if any,  within 6 
weeks thereafter.  
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the 
application of the petitioner for conversion from lease -hold to free -hold shall 
also be de cided  by the respondent -DDA in accordance with law.   
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.

1. These are writ petitions filed by the petitioners seeking relief against the respondent-Delhi Development Authority (hereinafter DDA). Since these petitions raise somewhat identical issues, they are being heard and disposed of by a common order. 
2. W.P.(C) 15655/2004 has been filed seeking the following substantial prayers:
i) to direct a writ of certiorari thereby quashing the letter dated 2/1/2002 whereby the lease of the premises bearing No. B-2/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi was illegally and arbitrarily cancelled by the respondents;
ii) to direct a writ of mandamus thereby directing the respondents to convert the premises bearing No.B-4/228, Safdurjung Enclave from lease hold to free hold;
iii) to direct the respondents to not to levy any misuse charges on the petitioners as there is no misuse of the premises bearing No.B- 4/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi by the petitioners;.
3. W.P.(C) 143/2012 has been filed seeking to challenge the misuser charges levied by the respondent-DDA. The prayer clause reads as under:
i) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the nature of Certiorari quashing the alleged demand (Annexure P-1) given to petitioner No. 1 on 28.7.2011;
ii) to issue, a Writ, Order, Direction more particularly a Writ in the nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to convert the peremises bearing No. B-4/228, Safdurjung Enclave, New Delhi from lease hold to free hold for which application was submitted in the year 1996 (Annexure-6);.
Brief Facts
4. Admittedly, the facts of the case are that the petitioners participated in an auction and being the successful bidders, were allotted plot No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi (hereinafter said premises/plot) on lease-hold basis.
5. The possession of the plot was handed over to the petitioner on 28.09.1979 and thereafter the respondent-DDA executed a lease deed dated 18.08.1980.
6. The petitioners got the building plans sanctioned and completed the construction in the year 1981. The petitioners constructed basement, ground, first and second floor in the said premises in accordance with the sanction plan. The petitioners are using the entire premises for residential purposes. 
7. It is stated that the petitioners are consultants by profession. Petitioner No. 1 also runs a registered Small Scale Industry Unit (hereinafter, SSI Unit) engaged in the business of supplying electronic equipment to Doordarshan and Prasar Bharti.
8. The petitioners are running their office from UG-5, Som Dutt Chamber 1, 5, Bhikaji Cama Place, New Delhi in the name of M/s Deep Electronics and Deepjot Electronics.
9. It is also stated that the petitioners were using the basement of the said premises for storing some equipment which, according to the petitioners, is permissible under the Building Bye-laws.
10. It is stated that the petitioners in the year 1996 applied for converting the said plot from leasehold to freehold. 
11. Vide letter dated 02.01.2002, the petitioners were informed that the lease of the petitioners was cancelled on 26.12.2001 due to the fact that the said property was being used contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease, thereby making it void. 
12. It is stated that despite repeated clarifications and requests through various letters, no action was taken by the respondent-DDA to restore the lease or convert the said plot from lease-hold to free-hold. 
13. Hence, W.P.(C) 15655/2004 was filed. 
14. In W.P.(C) 143/2012, it is stated that pursuant to the filing of W.P.(C) 15655/2004, the respondent vide demand statement dated 28.07.2011 levied Rs. 1,05,31,041/- as misuse charges calculated on the basis of the area of 109.48 sqm. 
15. It is this misuse charge which is sought to be quashed by the petitioners in W.P.(C) 143/2012, who state that the area of 109.48 sq. m. as stated in the demand statement is contrary to the record of the respondents. 
Submissions
16. It is stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is liable to be set aside on the ground that it suffers from vice of infraction of principles of natural justice and non-application of mind. It is submitted that the said cancellation letter was not preceded by any show cause notice (SCN) qua any alleged misuse. 
17. It is stated that in the only SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 filed by the respondent-DDA along with its counter-affidavit, the SCN pertained to the alleged misuser in the shape of permitting the use of subject premises for the purpose of Office/Store of an entity Electric Enterprises, which was never owned/operated by the petitioners. Further, the cancellation letter was issued on the premise of an entity Deep Jyoti Electronics using the basement of the premises, which was again never owned/operated by the petitioners. Neither has the respondent-DDA placed any proof in this regard, and thus, the action on the basis of the said SCN dated 15.05.1987 is ex-facie bad in law. 
18. It is further stated that while the lease was cancelled on 26.12.2001 (informed to the petitioners vide letter dated 02.01.2002), the respondent-DDA vide letter dated 01.04.2002 called upon the petitioner to submit documents for conversion of the subject premises from lease-hold to free-hold. Despite the fact that the issue of conversion was under consideration of the DDA, the respondent-DDA took precipitative actions without there being any reasonable justification. 
19. Regarding the issue of misuser charges, it is submitted that the respondent-DDA has proceeded to levy a demand of misuser charges vide letter dated 31.07.2009, which have been calculated in two phases i.e. from 15.01.1986 to 07.02.2002 and from 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003. 
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that while the alleged misuser began in the year 1986, the demand only came out on 31.07.2009. Relying upon the judgment in Prof. Ram Prakash v. DDA dated 17.08.2008 in W.P.(C.) No. 84640/2006, it is stated that the Executive Authorities are expected to act reasonably and without inordinate delay, and thus the demand for misuser charges is barred by limitation and amounts to unreasonable exercise of power, and hence must be quashed. 
21. It is further stated that there was no misuser, the petitioner was running his professional consultancy business from Bhikaji Cama Place and was only using the basement for storage purposes. 
22. It is further argued that the non-application of mind in so far as the demand for misuser is concerned is evident from the office noting as available on the file of the respondent-DDA. The entire calculation of the misuser area is based on conjectures and surmises as the respondent-DDA was itself not clear as to the area under misuse. 
23. It is stated that the total area of the plot is around 1800 sq. ft. As per the Building Bye-Laws, a professional is entitled to use a residential premise for professional work to an extent of 500 sq. ft. or 25% or 50 sq. mts. of the covered area. In the present case, the misuser as determined by the respondent-DDA has been determined at 19.34 sq. mts. which is within the permissible limits and as such, it entails no misuser, and the petitioner being a professional/consultant in electronic goods and a vendor thereof is entitled to this protection. 
24. Mr. Birbal, learned standing counsel appears for the respondent-DDA and states that since the premises were being misused, the lease was cancelled.
25. As regards the misuser charges are concerned, it is the stand of respondent-DDA that the same are in accordance with the law and policy and deserve to be upheld.
Analysis
26. I have heard learned counsels for the parties.
On Cancellation of Lease Deed
27. In the counter-affidavit filed by the respondent-DDA, it has been stated that there are multiple show cause notices issued and at least 9 inspections conducted by the respondent-DDA. Despite this, only one SCN has been annexed by the respondent i.e. the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987. 
28. It was observed by the Honble Supreme Court in UMC Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India, (2021) 2 SCC 551
13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of civilised jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is sought to be taken or whose right or interests are being affected should be given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The basic principle of natural justice is that before adjudication starts, the authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the case against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be adequate and the grounds necessitating action and the penalty/action proposed should be mentioned specifically and unambiguously. An order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is impermissible and without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property [Nasir Ahmad v. Custodian General, Evacuee Property, (1980) 3 SCC 1] has held that it is essential for the notice to specify the particular grounds on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken so as to enable the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any reasonable opportunity of being heard.
29. A perusal of the said SCN clearly shows that the same is vague and devoid of any details. It states that the basement is being misused contrary to the terms and conditions of the lease. It also does not specify the area that is being misused, and further mentions that the plot is being used as an office/store for the entity Electric Enterprises (which, as per the petitioner, is not owned/operated by him). Truecopy of the SCN dated 11/15.05.1987 is reproduced herein under:-


30. A perusal of the office noting further shows that the respondent DDA itself is taking conflicting stance with regard to area being misused and its purpose, the details of which are as under: 

Misuser Calculation Chart @Pg. 93, Document 13 (Convenience Compilation/ CC)

From 08.02.2002 to 31.03.2003.

h.
Office Note (118/N) dated 29.08.2002
- Respondent records that the misused area as per the 1996 report was 216 sq. ft., and as per the 1998 report was 109.48 sq. mtrs., and as per the 2002 report is 12.71 sq. mtrs. 
- Respondent after going through the entire note sheets and assessment of area under misuse gives a finding that misuse area charges are leviable for an area of 19.34 sq. mts. w.e.f. 15.01.1986 to 28.06.1999.
Pg.144-145

31. At times, the respondent-DDA states that the petitioner is permitted to use the basement for the purposes it was being used and at times that an area of 12.71 sq. meters is being misused. At some places, the respondent states that the area misused is 216 sq. feet and at other places there are allegations that the area under misuse is 19.34 sq. meters, and at times that the area under misuse is 109.48 sq. meters.
32. For the said reasons, it is abundantly clear that the respondent-DDA itself is not clear as to the area which is under misuse of the petitioners.
33. Since the respondent-DDA itself is unclear about the area under misuse despite stating to have conducted numerous inspections, the SCN itself is vague and devoid of the specifications of the area that is under misuse.
34. The acts of the respondent-DDA is not preceded by a proper SCN informing the petitioner regarding the area that was being misused, no hearing was given to the petitioner and despite the same, his lease was cancelled.
35. For the said reasons, I am of the view that the cancellation of the lease deed with respect to plot bearing No. 228, Block No. B-4, Safdarjung Enclave, New Delhi is faulty and violates Principals of Natural Justice.
36. The writ petition is allowed and the cancellation letter dated 02.01.2002 is hereby set aside.
On Misuser Charges
37. The next question that arises for my consideration is if there was any misuser and the amount to be charged for that misuser.
38. A perusal of the writ petition of the petitioner itself shows that the petitioner admits that an area of 12.71 sq. meters was being misused as storage.
39. The same, admittedly, is contrary to the master plan, the zonal development plan and the terms of the lease and more particularly clause II(13) of the lease deed which reads as under:
(13) The Lessee shall not without the written consent of the Lessor carry on, or permit to be carried on the residential plot or in any building thereon any trade or business whatsoever or use the same or permit the same to be used for any purpose other than that of private dwelling or do or suffer to be done therein any act or thing whatsoever which in the opinion of the Lessor may be a nuisance, annoyance or disturbance to the Lessor and person living in the neighbourhood.
PROVIDED that, if the Lessee is desirous of using the said Residential plot or the building thereon for a purpose other then that of private dwelling, the Lessor may allow such change of user on such terms and conditions, including payment of additional premium and additional rent, as the Lessor may in his absolute discretion determine. 
40. The noting of the respondent DDA shows that during inspection it has been found that an area of 19.34 sq. meters is being misused for storage/office purpose. Hence, for an area of 19.34 sq. meters, the misuser charges will have to be paid by the petitioner.
41. Mr. Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, on instructions of his client who is present in Court, is agreeable to payment of those charges from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation.
42. The respondent DDA is directed to undertake the calculation of misuser charges of 19.34 sq. meters with effect from 15.01.1986 till the date of cancellation within a period of 4 weeks from today and the petitioner shall make the said payment along with restoration charges, if any, within 6 weeks thereafter.
43. On payment of restoration charges and misuser charges, the application of the petitioner for conversion from lease-hold to free-hold shall also be decided by the respondent-DDA in accordance with law.	
44. Subject to the above, W.P.(C) 143/2012 is allowed.
45. Needless to add, in case the petitioner is aggrieved by any further action of the respondent pursuant to the orders passed today, the petitioner will be at liberty to challenge the same in accordance with law.
46. With these directions, the petitions are disposed of. 
47. Pending applications, if any, are hereby disposed of.

4. The Family Court has awarded interim maintenance to the

petition.
4.1 To be noted, the appellant/husband has instituted a petition for
divorce under Section 13 (1)(ia) of the HMA.
5. Ms. Shikha Kaushik, learned counsel, who appears on behalf of the
appellant/husband, says that the learned Additional Principal Judge did not
apply his mind independently. Ms Kaushik says that the impugned order is
pivoted on borrowed satisfaction drawn from the order of maintenance
ordered by the same Judge in proceedings instituted under Section 125 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [in short, “CrPC”]. Furthermore, Ms
Kaushik says that the appellant/husband has assailed the order passed under
Section 125 of the CrPC in a revision action.
5.1 It is, therefore, Ms. Kaushik’s submission that this appeal has been
filed to preserve the appellant’s/husband’s right to prosecute the revision
action.
6. We have perused the order passed by the learned Family Court. The
Family Court has recorded that the appellant/husband is earning
approximately Rs.14,40,000/- per month, excluding incentives and bonus.
6.1 Concededly, this fact emerged in the appellant /husband’s cross-
examination recorded on 26.08.2023.
6.2 Qua this aspect, it is Ms. Kaushik’s submission that the learned
Additional Principal Judge failed to take into account the corresponding
expenses that the appellant/husband has to incur at the place where he is
located.
7. We are informed that the appellant/husband is based in Singapore.
8. According to us, even if we were to factor in the expenses that theMAT.APP.(F.C.) 71/2024 Page 3 of 3appellant/husband may incur in Singapore, even then, the maintenance
awarded to the respondent/wife at the rate of Rs.75,000/- per month does not
seem to be unreasonable. Furthermore, the learned Additional Principal
Judge has also indicated in paragraph 7 of the impugned order that the
amount paid to the respondent/wife in any other proceedings shall stand
adjusted against the maintenance ordered by him viathe impugned order.
9. We find no reason to interfere with the impugned order.

1. The writ petitioner has approached this Court aggrieved by  the 
adjustment of a disputed tax demand pertaining to Assessment Year1
                                           
1 AY  
2018 -19 against refunds which were due to it for AYs ’ 2010 -11, 2011 -
12 and 2020- 21. The challenge is principally raised in the backdrop of 
the aforesaid adjustment having been made des pite the petitioner 
having moved a rectification application pertaining to the final   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 2 of 19 
 assessment which was framed for AY 2018 -19 and an admitted failure 
on the part of the respondents to consider and dispose of the stay 
application which was moved and was r eferable to Section 220(6) of 
the Income Tax Act, 19612
2. The petitioner filed its Return of Income.  It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the 
petitioner has prayed for the refund being processed after adjustment of 
20% of the disputed demand for AY 2018- 19. For the purposes of 
examining the reliefs  which are claimed , we deem it apposite to notice 
the following facts.  
3 for AY 2018 -19 on 29 
September 2018 claiming a refund of INR 6,45,65,160/ - on account of 
excess Taxes Deducted at Source4
3. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner preferred an appeal 
before the Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals) , National 
Faceless Appeal Centre which was deducted during the 
course of the said yea r.  In the course of processing of that ROI, notices 
under Section 143(2) and 14 2(1) of the Act came to be issued on 22 
September 2019 and 09 January 2020 respectively. On 16 November 2019 , the petitioner received an intimation,  referable to Section 143(1)  
of the Act,  apprising it of an amount of INR 6, 42,30,413/- being 
refundable along with interest. However, when the assessment was 
ultimately framed and a formal order was passed under Section 143(3) 
read with Section 144B  of the Act, various additions came to be made 
to the income disclosed in the R OI and leading to the creation of a 
demand of INR 10, 26,85,633/-. 
5

W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 3 of 19 
 Simultaneously , it also moved an application purporting to be under 
Section 154 of the Act for correction of rectifiable mistakes which 
according to it were apparent on the face of the record.  Along with  the 
rectification application , the petitioner on 28 May 2021 also filed a stay 
application in respect of the demand so raised. The rectification 
application however came to be perfunctorily rejected in terms of an 
order dated 07 June 2021 which is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“Sub: Rectification in case of National Association of Software 
and Service Companies for A.Y. 2018- 19 – Reg.  
1. In this connection, it is stated while finalizing the assessment 
u/s 143(3), the FAO had denied exemption u/s 11 of  the I.T. Act 
and has also made some other addition on the account of interest 
income, donation, TDS etc. and assessed at a taxable income of 
Rs. 24,65,40,625/ -. 
2. The order of the FAO is a speaking order on each additions 
made by him/her. This order u/s 143(3) cannot be rectified u/s 
154 as the additions made are not mistakes apparent from the 
record
 .” 
4. It would appear that during the pendency of the appeal before 
CIT(A), NFAC, and without attending to the stay application which had 
been moved, the respon dents proceeded to adjust the demand that stood 
created by vir tue of the assessment order dated 29 April 2021 on 04 
March 2022, 07 March 2022 and 30 March 2022 against various 
refunds which were payable to the petitioner for AYs ’ 2010- 11, 2011 -
12 and 2020 -21. According to the writ petitioner it was entitled to 
receive the following  refunds for the aforenoted AYs:  
 AY 2010 -11  INR 2,27,44,597/ - 
AY 2011 -12   INR 30,3 9,000/ - 
AY 2020 -21   INR 9,14,63,710/ -   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 4 of 19 
 5. According to Mr. Kapoor, learned counsel who appeared in 
support of the writ petition, the action so initiated and the adjustments 
effected are wholly arbitrary and illegal in as much as there existed no justification for the adjustments being made without its application referable to Section 220(6) being either considered or examined.  
According to Mr. Kapoor , the very purpose of Section 220(6) has be en 
nullified by the action of the respondents who have proceeded to make 
the impugned adjustments without even examining the application of the petitioner for not being treated as an “ assessee in default”.  
6. Mr. Kapoor additionally submitted that as per the Central Board 
of Direct Taxes Office Memorandum No. 404/72/93 -ITCC
6
7. Appear ing for the respondents , Mr. Maratha, learned counsel 
submitted that they were clearly justified in effecting the adjustments in 
the absence of a declaration having been rendered in favour of the 
petitioner that it was not an “ assessee in default”. Learned  counsel 
submitted that although an application under Section 154 of the Act had 
been moved, the issues which were sought to be canvassed  thereon 
clearly did not qualify  as an error apparent and thus the same rightly 
came to be rejected.   dated 31 
July 2017, the respondents could have at best required the petitioner to 
deposit 20%  of the outstanding demand. According to learned counsel,  
despite the aforesaid binding prescription,  the entire outstanding 
demand illegally created for AY 2018- 19 had been adjusted against the 
refunds which were due and payable to the petitioner.  
8. It was the submission of Mr. Maratha that the application for stay 
which was moved by the writ petitioner was not accompanied by any

 challan evidencing deposit of monies against the demand for AY 2018-
19 which was outstanding . Thus, and according to learned counsel, 
since a pre -condition as  specified in the  OM was not adhered to,  the 
application of the assessee was rightly not considered.    
9. Having noticed the rival submissions, we at the outset deem  it 
appropriate to extract the OM dated 31 July 2017 which reads as under:  
“OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC]

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC], DATED 
31-7-2017  
 
Instruction No. 1914 dated 21- 3-1996 contains guidelines issued 
by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of 
outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of 
demand.  
Vide O.M. NO.404/72/93- ITCC dated 29- 2-2016 . revised 
guidelines were issued in partial modification of  Instruction No 
1914, wherein, inter alia, vide para 4(A) it had been laid  down 
that in a case where the outstanding  demand is disputed before 
CIT(A) , the Assessing Officer shall grant stay of demand till 
disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed 
demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B ) 
there under  Similar references to the standard rate of 15% have 
also been made in succeeding paragraphs therein . 
The matter has been reviewed by the Board in the light of 
feedback received from field authorities. In view of the  Board's 
efforts to contain over pitched assessments through several 
measures resulting in fairer and more reasonable assessment 
orders, the standard rate of 15% of the disputed demand is found 
to be on the lower side. Accordingly, it has been decided that the 
standard rate prescrib ed in O.M. dated 29- 2-2016 be revised to 
20% of  the disputed demand, where the demand is contested 
before CIT(A). Thus, all references to 15% of the disputed    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 6 of 19 
 demand in the aforesaid O.M dated 29- 2-2016 hereby stand 
modified to 20% of the disputed demand. Other guidelines 
contained in the O.M. dated 29- 2-2016 shall remain unchanged
These modifications may be immediately brought to the notice of 
all officers working in your jurisdiction for  proper compliance.”  . 
 
10. It would also be beneficial at this juncture to notice the earlier 
OM dated 29 February 2016 and the same is reproduced hereinbelow:-  
 
“OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC]  
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME -TAX ACT, 1961 - 
COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX -  WHEN TAX 
PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN 
DEFAULT  - AMENDMENT OF INSTRUCTION NO.1914, 
DATED 21 -3-1996 TO PROVIDE FOR GUIDELINES FOR 
STAY OF DEMAND AT FIRST APPEAL STAGE  
 
OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC], DATED 
29-2-2016  
 
Instruction No. 1914 dated 21- 3-1996 contains guidelines issued 
by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of 
outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of 
demand.  
 2. In part 'C' of the Instruction, it has been prescribed that a 
demand will be stayed only if there are valid reasons for doing so and that mere filing of an appeal against the assessment order will 
not be a sufficient reason to stay the recovery of demand. It has been further prescribed that while granting stay, the field officers may require the assessee to offer a suitable security (bank 
guarantee, etc.) and/ or require the assessee to pay a reasonable amount in lump sum or in instalments.   3. It has been reported that the field authorities often insist on 
payment of a very high proportion of the disputed demand before granting stay  of the balance demand. This often results in 
hardship for the taxpayers seeking stay of demand.   4. In order to streamline the process of grant of stay and 
standardize the quantum of lump sum payment required to be made by the assessee as a pre- condition for stay of demand 
disputed before CIT (A), the following modified guidelines are being issued in partial modification of Instruction No. 1914:    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 7 of 19 
  
(A) In a case where the outstanding demand is disputed 
before CIT (A), the assessing officer shall grant stay  of 
demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the 
disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category 
discussed in para (B) hereunder
 .  
(B) In a situation where,  
(a) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of 
addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that 
payment of a lump sum amount higher than 15% is 
warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same 
issue has been confirmed by appellate authorities in 
earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or 
jurisd ictional High Court is in favour of Revenue or 
addition is based on credible evidence collected in a 
search or survey operation, etc.) or
 ,  
(b) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of 
addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that 
payment of a lump sum amount lower than 15% is 
warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same 
issue has been deleted by appellate authorities in earlier 
years or the decision of the Supreme Court or 
jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the asses see, 
etc.), the assessing officer shall refer the matter to the 
administrative Pr. CIT/CIT, who after considering all 
relevant facts shall decide the quantum/proportion of 
demand to be paid by the assessee as lump sum payment 
for granting a stay of the bal ance demand
 .  
(C) In a case where stay of demand is granted by the 
assessing officer on payment of 15% of the disputed demand 
and the assessee is still aggrieved, he may approach the 
jurisdictional administrative Pr. CIT/CIT for a review of the 
decision of the assessing officer
 . 
(D) The assessing officer shall dispose of a stay petition 
within 2 weeks of filing of the petition. If a reference has been made to Pr. CIT/CIT under para 4 (B) above or a review petition has been filed by the assessee under para  4 (C) 
above, the same shall also be disposed of by the Pr. CIT/CIT within 2 weeks of the assessing officer making such reference or the assessee filing such review, as the case may be.     
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 8 of 19 
 (E) In granting stay, the Assessing Officer may impose such 
conditions as he may think fit. He may, inter alia, -  
 
(i) require an undertaking from the assessee that he will cooperate in the early disposal of appeal failing which the stay order will be cancelled;  
 (ii) reserve the right to review the order passed after expiry of reasonable period (say 6 months) or if the 
assessee has not co -operated in the early disposal of 
appeal, or where a subsequent pronouncement by a higher appellate authority or court alters the above situations;  
 (iii) reserve the right to adjust re funds arising, if any, 
against the demand, to the extent of the amount required for granting stay and subject to the provisions of section 245.   
5. These instructions/guidelines may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your juri sdiction for proper 
compliance. ” 
 
11. In our considered opinion , the respondents have proceeded on a 
wholly incorrect and untenable premise that the assessee was obliged to 
tender or place evidence of having deposited 20% of the dis puted 
demand before its appl ication for stay under Section 220(6)  of the Act  
could have been considered. The interpretation which is sought to be 
accorded to the aforesaid OM is clearly misconceived for the following 
reasons.  
12. It must at the outset be noted that the two OMs’ noticed a bove 
neither prescribe nor mandate 15% or 20% of the outstanding demand 
as the case may be,  being deposited as a pre -condition for grant of stay. 
The OM dated 29 February 2016 specifically spoke of a discretion 
vesting in the AO to grant stay subject to a deposit at a rate higher or 
lower than 15% dependent upon the facts of a particular case. The 
subsequent OM merely amended the rate to be 20%. In fact, while the   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 9 of 19 
 subsequent OM chose to describe the 20% deposit to be the “ standard 
rate”, the same would clea rly not sustain in light of the discussion 
which ensues.  
13. We note that while dealing with an identical question , we had in 
Avant ha Realty  Ltd. vs The Principal Commissioner of Income Tax 
Central Delhi 2 & Anr.7
“2. We note that the impu gned orders are principally based on the 
instructions of the Central Board of Direct Tax  [“CBDT ”] as 
encapsulated in the Office Memorandum  dated 31 July 2017 and 
which had while dealing with the manner in which the power 
under Section 220(6) of the Act is liable to be exercised had held that assessees’ may be accorded interim protection subject to deposit of 20% of the total outstanding demand failing which they would be treated as an “assessee in default ”.    observed as under:  
3. Insofar as the aforesaid Office Memorandum is concerned, 
suffice it to note that while considering its ambit the Supreme Court in Princip al Commissioner of Income Tax and Others 
vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited had held as follows: - 
“1. Delay condoned. Leave Granted.  
 2. Having heard Shri Vikr amjit Banerjee, learned ASG 
appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi- judicial authority, we 
only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will 
be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal.  
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending 
application, if any, shall stand disposed of.”  
 
14. As is manifest from the order passed by the Supreme Court in 
Principal Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. vs  LG Electronics

W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 10 of 19 
 India Pvt. Ltd.8, it had been emphasized that the administrative 
circular would not operate as a f etter upon the power other wise 
conferred on a quasi-judicial authority and that it would be wholly 
incorrect to view the OM as mandating the deposit of 20% , irrespective 
of the facts of an individual case.  This would also flow from the clear 
and express la nguage employed in sub -section (6) of Section 220 which 
speaks of the Assessing Officer9
15. The issue of a grant of stay pending appellate remedies be ing 
pursued arose for the consideration of a Division Bench of th e Court in  
Dabur India Limited vs Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) & 
Anr. being empowered “ in his discretion 
and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to impose in the 
circumstances of the case ”.  The discretion thus vested in the hands of 
the AO is one which cannot possibly be viewed as being cabine d by the 
terms of the O M.  
10
“6. , where it was pertinently observed as under:  
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and 
having perused the two Office Memorandums, in 
question, this Court is of the view that the requirement 
of payment of tw enty percent of disputed tax demand is 
not a pre -requisite for putting in abeyance recovery of 
demand pending first appeal in all cases. The said pre -
condition of deposit of twenty percent of the demand 
can be relaxed in appropriate cases. Even the Office 
Memorandum dated 29 February, 2016 gives instances 
like where addition on the same issue has been deleted 
by the appellate authorities in earlier years or where the 
decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High 
Court is in favour of the assessee

8. In the present case, the impugned order is non-
reasoned. The three basic principles i.e. the prima facie 
case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury have 
not been considered while deciding the stay 
application
 .” 
16. More recently  in Indian National Congress vs Deputy 
Commissioner of Income Tax Central –  19 & Ors.11
“22. However, as we read the order impugned, the matter does not 
appear to have proceeded along those lines before the ITAT. The 
tone and tenor of submissions clearly appear to have been concentrated upon the merits of the assessment order.  we had an 
occasion to examine the scope of the power conferred by Section 
220(6) of the Act and which was explained in the following terms:  
Although 
the issue of payment of 20% of the outstanding demand appears 
to have been raised, the same came to be summarily rejected by 
the ITAT in cryptic terms. Notwithstanding the above, it becomes 
pertinent to observe that the 20% deposit which is spoken of in 
the OM dated 31 July 2017 is not liable to be viewed as a 
condition etched in stone or one which is inviolable. The OM 
merely seeks to provide guidance to the authorities to bear in 
mind certain aspects while considering applications for stay of 
demand pending an appeals remedy being pursued. The OM is 
not liable to be read as conferring an indefeasible right upon the 
assessee to claim a stay of a tax liability by merely offering or 
consenting to deposit 20% of the outstanding liability. Ultimately, 
it is for the authorities to examine and con sider what amount 
would be sufficient to securitise the interest of the Revenue and 
thus a just balance being struck. The quantum of the deposit tha t 
would be required to be made would ultimately depend upon the 
facts and circumstances of each case
“1. Delay condoned. Leave granted.  . This i s evident from the 
order of the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of 
Income Tax and others Vs. LG Electronics India Private 
Limited and which is extracted hereunder: -

11 Neutral Citation –  2024:DHC:2016- DB Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learn ed ASG 
appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence 
to the fact that he has argued before us that the   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 12 of 19 
 administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the 
Commissioner since it is a quasi- judicial authority, we 
only need to clarify that  in all cases like the present, it will 
be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, 
to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, 
pending appeal
 . 
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending 
application, if any, shall stand disposed of.”  
 
23. The position which thus emerges is that while 20% is not 
liable to be viewed as an entrenched or inflexible rule, there could 
be circumstances where the respondents may be justified in 
seeking a deposit in excess of the above dependent upon the facts 
and circumstances that may obtain. This would have to 
necessarily be left to the sound exercise of discretion by the 
respondents based upon a consideration of issues such as prima 
facie, financial hardship and the likelihood of success. This 
observation we render being conscious of the indisputable 
position that the OM applies only upto the stage of the appeal 
pending before the CIT(A) and being of little significance when it 
comes to the ITAT
 .”  
17. As explained in Indian National Congress , the 20% which is 
spoken of in the OM cannot possibly be viewed as being an inviolate o r 
inflexible condition. The extent of the deposit which an assessee may 
be called upon to make would have to be examined and answered 
bearing in mind factors such as prima fac ie case, undue hardship and 
likelihood of success. We note that while dealing with the question of 
the claim of stay as made by an assessee and the competing obligation 
to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Supreme Court in Benara 
Valves Ltd. & Ors. Vs Commissioner of Central Excise & Anr.12
“6. Principles relating to grant of stay pending disposal of the 
matters before the forums concerned have been considered in  
had elucidated the legal position in the following words : 
                                           
12 (2006) 1 3 SCC 347    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 13 of 19 
 several cases. It is to be noted that in such matters though 
discretion is available, the same has to be exercised judicially.  
7. The applicable principles have been set out succinctly 
in Silliguri Municipality v. Amalendu Das  and Samarias Trading 
Co. (P) Ltd. v. S. Samuel  and CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd.  
8. It is true that on merely establishing a prima facie case, interim 
order of p rotection should not be passed. But if on a cursory 
glance it appears that the demand raised has no leg to stand  on, it 
would be undesirable to require the assessee to pay full or 
substantive part of the demand. Petitions for stay should not be 
disposed of  in a routine matter unmindful of the consequences 
flowing from the order requiring the assessee to deposit full or 
part of the demand. There can be no rule of universal application 
in such matters and the order has to be passed keeping in view the 
factual  scenario involved. Merely because this Court has indicated 
the principles that does not give a license to the forum/authority 
to pass an order which cannot be sustained on the touchstone of 
fairness, legality and public interest. Where denial of interim 
relief may lead to public mischief, grave irreparable private injury  
or shake a citizen ’s faith in the impartiality of public 
administration, interim relief can be given
9. It has become an unfortunate trend to casually dispose of stay 
applications by refe rring to decisions in Siliguri Municipality  and 
Dunlop India cases without analysing factual scenario involved in 
a particular case.  .

11. Two significant expressions used in the provisions are ""undue 
hardship to such person"" and ""safegua rd the interests of 
Revenue "". Therefore, while dealing with the application twin 
requirements of considerations i.e. consideration of undue 
hardship aspect and imposition of conditions to safeguard the 
interest of Revenue have to be kept in view
12. As no ted above there are two important expressions in . 
Section 
35-F. One is undue hardship. This is a matter within the special 
knowledge of the applicant for waiver and has to be established by him. A mere  assertion about undue hardship would not be 
sufficient. It was noted by this Court in S. Vasudeva v. State of Karnataka that under  Indian conditions expression ""undue 
hardship"" is normally related to e conomic hardship. 
""Undue"" 
which means  something which is not merited by the conduct of 
the claimant, or is very much disproportionate to it. Undue 
hardship is caused when the hardship is not warranted by the 
circumstances.    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 14 of 19 
 13. For a hardship to be 'undue' it must be shown that the 
particular burden to observe or perform the requirement is out of 
proportion to the nature of the requirement itself, and the benefit 
which the applicant would derive from compliance with it.  
14. The word ""undue"" adds something more than just hardship. It 
means an excessive hardship or a hardship greater than the 
circumstances warrant
15. . 
The other aspect relates to imposition of condition to 
safeguard the interest of Revenue . This is an aspect which the 
Tribunal has to bring into focus. It is for the Tribunal to impose 
such conditions as are deemed proper to safeguard the interest s of 
the Revenue . Therefore, the Tribunal while dealing with the 
application has to consider materials to be placed by the assessee 
relating to undue har dship and also to stipulate condition as 
required to safeguard the interest of the Revenue
 .” 
The aforesaid principles were reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 
Monotosh Saha vs Special Director, Enforcement Directorate & 
Anr.13
18. We find a lucid explanation of  the legal position with respect to 
pre-deposit and the grant of stay  in a decision rendered by a Division  
Bench of the Allahabad High Court in ITC Ltd v. Commissioner 
(Appeals), Customs & Central Excise

“18. In Income- tax Officer  v. M.K. Mohammad Kunhi , AIR 1969 
SC 430, the Apex Court held that stay should be granted if a 
strong  prima facie case  has been made out and in the most 
deserving and appropriate cases where entire purpose of the 
appeal will be frustrated or re ndered nugatory by allowing the 
recovery proceedings to continue, during the pendency of the 
appeal.   where the Court had held as

21. In Mehsana District Cooperative Milk P.U. Ltd. v. Union of 
India, 2003 (154) E.L.T. 347 (S.C.), the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
considered the case of dispensation of pre -deposit condition and 
held that the Appellate Authority must address to itself to the 
prima  facie  merits of the appellant's case and upon being satisfied 
of the same, determine the quantum of deposit taking int o 
consideration the financial hardship and other such related factors
xxxx   xxxx   xxxx . 
 23. 
In J.N. Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. CEGAT , 1991 (53) E.L.T. 543, 
the Calcutta High Court while considering the provisions of pre -
deposit of duty and penalty, observed that where the authority 
concerned comes to the conclusion that the appellant has a 
good prima facie case  so as to justify the dispensation of 
requirement of pre -deposit of the disputed amount on duty and 
penalty, the authority must exercise its discretio n to dispense with 
such requirement particularly in a case where the appellant 
satisfies the authority concerned that its case is squarely covered 
by the decision of a competent Court binding on it. In such an 
eventuality, asking the appellant to deposit t he duty demanded 
and penalty levied would undoubtedly cause undue hardship to 
the appellant. While deciding the said case, Calcutta High Court 
placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court 
in L. Hirday Narain v. Income -Tax Officer, Bareilly , (1970) 2 
SCC 355 : AIR 1971 SC 33, wherein the Court observed as 
under
“If a statute invests a public officer with authority to do an act in a specified set of circumstances, it is imperative upon him to exercise his authority in a manner appropriate to t he 
case when a party interested and having a right to apply moved in that behalf and circumstances for exercise of authority are shown to exist. Even if the words used in the statute  prima facie  enabling, the courts will readily infer a 
duty to exercise po wer which is invested in aid of 
enforcement of a right -public or private -of a citizen.”  : 
 24. 
Thus, even where enabling or discretionary power is conferred 
on a public authority, the words which are permissive in 
character, require to be constituted, involving a duty to exercise 
that power, if some legal right or entitlement is conferred or 
enjoyed, and for the effectuating the such right or entitlement, the 
exercise of such power is essential. The aforesaid view stands   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 16 of 19 
 fortified in view of that fact that ev ery power is coupled with a 
duty to act reasonably and the Court/Tribunal/Authority has to 
proceed having strict adherence to the provisions of law.

26. In Bongaigaon Refinery & Petrochem Ltd. v. Collector of 
Central Excise (A) , 1994 (69) E.L.T. 193 (Cal.), the Calcutta High 
Court, while examining a similar issue and placed reliance upon a large number of judgments  and held that the phrase “undue 
hardship” would cover a case where the appellant has a strong  prima facie case . The phrase also covers a situation where 
there is an arguable case in the appeal. If the Appellate Authority forms the opinion that appellant has a strong  prima facie case , it 
should dispense with the pre -deposit condition altogether. 
However, where it is of the opinion that the appellant has no 
arguable case, the Appellate Authority must safeguard the interest 
of the Revenue, as the same also cannot be jeopardised.  27
. In Sri Krishna v. Union of India, 1998 (104) E.L.T. 305, 
Delhi High Court considered the issue of dispensation of pre -
deposit condition and the concept of undue hardship while 
considering the provisions of Section 129E of the Cust oms Act, 
1962 and Section 35 of the Act and held that the Court while 
considering the case of the appellant should examine as to 
whether the Appellate Authority or Tribunal have dealt with the 
plea raised by the appellant before it and have considered as t o 
whether the appellant has a prima facie case  on merit. In case the 
appellant has a strong  prima facie case , as is most likely to 
exonerate him from liability and the Appellate Authority/Tribunal 
insists on the deposit of the amount, it would amount to undue 
hardship
 . 
28. In Hoogly Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 
637, the Calcutta High Court again reiterated the view that if the appellant has a strong  prima facie case , he is entitled of waiving 
the pre -deposit condition and in case the  Appellate Authority 
insists to deposit the amount so assessed or penalty so levied, it will cause undue hardship to the assessee. While considering the said case, the Court placed reliance upon the large number of   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 17 of 19 
 judgments including  Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner

Fertilizer  v. Union of India, 1985 (22) E.L.T. 301 (All.);  Re. 
American Refrigeration Co. Ltd., 1986 (23) E.L.T. 74; and V.I.T. 
Sea Foods  v. Collector of Customs , 1989 (42) E.L.T. 220 (Ker.), 
wherein the Courts had expressed the similar view.  29. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs 
(Appeals) ILR 2000 KAR 25, while examining the issue of pre -
deposit under Section 35 of the Act, after considering a large number  of judgments of the Apex Court and various High Courts, 
it was held as under:  
“
While considering the case of ‘undue hardship’, the 
authority is required to examine the  prima facie  on merits 
of the dispute as well. Pleading of financial disability 
would not be the only consideration. Where the case is 
fully covered in favour of the assessee by a biding 
precedent like that of the judgment of the Supreme Court, 
jurisdictional High Court or a Special Bench of the 
Tribunal, then to still insist upon the deposit  of duty and 
penalty levied would certainly cause undue hardship to the 
assessee. Absence of the financial hardship in such a case 
would be no ground to decline the dispensation of pre -
deposit under the proviso to Section 35F. The power to 
dispense with such deposit is conferred under the 
authorities has to be exercised precisely in cases like this 
type and if it is not exercised under such circumstances 
then this Court will require it to be exercised. Such like 
cases where two views are not possible then t he condition 
of pre -deposit before the appeal is heard on merits, can be 
dispensed with. In case two views are possible on 
interpretation, based on conflicting judgments of the 
Tribunal or different High Courts in the absence of the 
judgment of the jurisdi ctional High Court then the 
authorities may pass the order under proviso to Section 
35F of the Act keeping in view the facts of the case in 
hand
xxxx   xxxx   xxxx .” 
 35. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid authorities make it clear 
that the Court should not grant interim relief/stay of the recovery 
merely by asking of a party. It has to maintain a balance between 
the rights of an individual and the State so far as the recovery of 
sovereign dues is concerned. While considering the application 
for stay/waive r of a pre -deposit, as required under the law, the 
Court must apply its mind as to whether the appellant has a   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 18 of 19 
 strong  prima facie case on merit. In case it is covered by the 
judgment of a Court/Tribunal binding upon the Appellate 
Authority, it should apply  its mind as to whether in view of the 
said judgment, the appellant is likely to succeed on merit. If an 
appellant having strong  prima facie case , is asked to deposit the 
amount of assessment so made or penalty so levied, it would 
cause undue hardship to him, though there may be no financial 
restrain on the appellant running in a good financial condition . 
The arguments that appellant is in a position to deposit or if he 
succeeds in appeal, he will be entitled to get the refund, are not the considerations fo r deciding the application. The order of the 
Appellate Authority itself must show that it had applied its mind to the issue raised by the appellant and it has been considered in accordance with the law
. The expression “undue hardship” has a 
wider connotati on as it takes within its ambit the case where the 
assessee is asked to deposit the amount even if he is likely to 
exonerate from the total liability on disposal of his appeal. 
Dispensation of deposit should also be allowed where two views 
are possible. While considering the application for interim relief, 
the Court must examine all pros and cons involved in the case and 
further examine that in case recovery is not stayed, the right of 
appeal conferred by the legislature and refusal to exercise the 
discreti onary power by the authority to stay/waive the predeposit 
condition, would be reduced to nugatory/illusory. Undoubtedly, 
the interest of the Revenue cannot be jeopardized but that does 
not mean that in order to protect the interest of the Revenue, the 
Cour t or authority should exercise its duty under the law to take 
into consideration the rights and interest of an in dividual. It is 
also clear that before any goods could be subjected to duty, it has 
to be established that it has been manufactured and it is 
marketable and to prove that it is marketable, the burden is on the 
Revenue and not on the manufacturer
 .” 
19. Though some of the decisions noticed by us hereinabove 
pertained to pre -deposit prescriptions placed by  a statute , the principles 
enunciated therein would clearly be of relevance while examining the 
extent of the power that stands placed in the hands of the AO in terms of Section 220(6)  of the Act . In our considered opinion , the respondents 
have clearly erred in proceeding on the assumption that the ap plication 
for consideration of outstanding demands being placed in abeyance could not have even been entertained without a 20% pre -deposit. The   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 19 of 19 
 aforesaid stand as taken is thoroughly misconceived and wholly 
untenable in law.  
20. Undisputedly , and on the date when the impugned adjustments 
came to be made , the application moved by the petitioner referable to 
Section 220(6) of the Act had neither been considered nor disposed of . 
The respondents have thus in our considered opinion clearly acted 
arbitrarily in proc eeding to adjust the demand for AY 2018 -19 against 
available refunds without attending to th at application.  This action of 
the respondents is wholly arbitrary and unfair. The intimation of 
adjustments being proposed would hardly be of any relevance or 
consequence once it is found that the application for stay remained 
pending and the said fact is not an issue of contestation.  21. We consequently allow the instant writ petition and remit the 
matter to the respondents for considering the application of the 
petitioner under Section 220(6) in accordance with the observations 
made hereinabove. The issue of the amount of refund liable to be 
released shall abide by the decision which the respondents shall now take pursuant to the directions framed hereinabove.

1. The writ petitioner has approached this Court aggrieved by the adjustment of a disputed tax demand pertaining to Assessment Year1 2018-19 against refunds which were due to it for AYs 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2020-21. The challenge is principally raised in the backdrop of the aforesaid adjustment having been made despite the petitioner having moved a rectification application pertaining to the final assessment which was framed for AY 2018-19 and an admitted failure on the part of the respondents to consider and dispose of the stay application which was moved and was referable to Section 220(6) of the Income Tax Act, 19612.  It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the petitioner has prayed for the refund being processed after adjustment of 20% of the disputed demand for AY 2018-19. For the purposes of examining the reliefs which are claimed, we deem it apposite to notice the following facts.
2. The petitioner filed its Return of Income3 for AY 2018-19 on 29 September 2018 claiming a refund of INR 6,45,65,160/- on account of excess Taxes Deducted at Source4 which was deducted during the course of the said year.  In the course of processing of that ROI, notices under Section 143(2) and 142(1) of the Act came to be issued on 22 September 2019 and 09 January 2020 respectively. On 16 November 2019, the petitioner received an intimation, referable to Section 143(1) of the Act, apprising it of an amount of INR 6,42,30,413/- being refundable along with interest. However, when the assessment was ultimately framed and a formal order was passed under Section 143(3) read with Section 144B of the Act, various additions came to be made to the income disclosed in the ROI and leading to the creation of a demand of INR 10,26,85,633/-.
3. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals), National Faceless Appeal Centre5, which is stated to be pending.  Simultaneously, it also moved an application purporting to be under Section 154 of the Act for correction of rectifiable mistakes which according to it were apparent on the face of the record. Along with the rectification application, the petitioner on 28 May 2021 also filed a stay application in respect of the demand so raised. The rectification application however came to be perfunctorily rejected in terms of an order dated 07 June 2021 which is reproduced hereinbelow:
Sub: Rectification in case of National Association of Software and Service Companies for A.Y. 2018-19  Reg.
1. In this connection, it is stated while finalizing the assessment u/s 143(3), the FAO had denied exemption u/s 11 of the I.T. Act and has also made some other addition on the account of interest income, donation, TDS etc. and assessed at a taxable income of Rs. 24,65,40,625/-.
2. The order of the FAO is a speaking order on each additions made by him/her. This order u/s 143(3) cannot be rectified u/s 154 as the additions made are not mistakes apparent from the record.

4. It would appear that during the pendency of the appeal before CIT(A), NFAC, and without attending to the stay application which had been moved, the respondents proceeded to adjust the demand that stood created by virtue of the assessment order dated 29 April 2021 on 04 March 2022, 07 March 2022 and 30 March 2022 against various refunds which were payable to the petitioner for AYs 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2020-21. According to the writ petitioner it was entitled to receive the following refunds for the aforenoted AYs:
 AY 2010-11		INR 2,27,44,597/-
     AY 2011-12			INR 30,39,000/-
     AY 2020-21			INR 9,14,63,710/-
5. According to Mr. Kapoor, learned counsel who appeared in support of the writ petition, the action so initiated and the adjustments effected are wholly arbitrary and illegal in as much as there existed no justification for the adjustments being made without its application referable to Section 220(6) being either considered or examined.  According to Mr. Kapoor, the very purpose of Section 220(6) has been nullified by the action of the respondents who have proceeded to make the impugned adjustments without even examining the application of the petitioner for not being treated as an assessee in default. 
6. Mr. Kapoor additionally submitted that as per the Central Board of Direct Taxes Office Memorandum No. 404/72/93-ITCC6 dated 31 July 2017, the respondents could have at best required the petitioner to deposit 20% of the outstanding demand. According to learned counsel, despite the aforesaid binding prescription, the entire outstanding demand illegally created for AY 2018-19 had been adjusted against the refunds which were due and payable to the petitioner. 
7. Appearing for the respondents, Mr. Maratha, learned counsel submitted that they were clearly justified in effecting the adjustments in the absence of a declaration having been rendered in favour of the petitioner that it was not an assessee in default. Learned counsel submitted that although an application under Section 154 of the Act had been moved, the issues which were sought to be canvassed thereon clearly did not qualify as an error apparent and thus the same rightly came to be rejected. 
8. It was the submission of Mr. Maratha that the application for stay which was moved by the writ petitioner was not accompanied by any challan evidencing deposit of monies against the demand for AY 2018-19 which was outstanding. Thus, and according to learned counsel, since a pre-condition as specified in the OM was not adhered to, the application of the assessee was rightly not considered.  
9. Having noticed the rival submissions, we at the outset deem it appropriate to extract the OM dated 31 July 2017 which reads as under:
OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC]
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX - WHEN

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC], DATED 31-7-2017

Instruction No. 1914 dated 21-3-1996 contains guidelines issued by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of demand.
Vide O.M. NO.404/72/93-ITCC dated 29-2-2016. revised guidelines were issued in partial modification of Instruction No 1914, wherein, inter alia, vide para 4(A) it had been laid down that in a case where the outstanding demand is disputed before CIT(A), the Assessing Officer shall grant stay of demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B) there under Similar references to the standard rate of 15% have also been made in succeeding paragraphs therein.
The matter has been reviewed by the Board in the light of feedback received from field authorities. In view of the Board's efforts to contain over pitched assessments through several measures resulting in fairer and more reasonable assessment orders, the standard rate of 15% of the disputed demand is found to be on the lower side. Accordingly, it has been decided that the standard rate prescribed in O.M. dated 29-2-2016 be revised to 20% of the disputed demand, where the demand is contested before CIT(A). Thus, all references to 15% of the disputed demand in the aforesaid O.M dated 29-2-2016 hereby stand modified to 20% of the disputed demand. Other guidelines contained in the O.M. dated 29-2-2016 shall remain unchanged.
These modifications may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your jurisdiction for proper compliance.

10. It would also be beneficial at this juncture to notice the earlier OM dated 29 February 2016 and the same is reproduced hereinbelow:-

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC]
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX - WHEN TAX PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN DEFAULT - AMENDMENT OF INSTRUCTION NO.1914, DATED 21-3-1996 TO PROVIDE FOR GUIDELINES FOR STAY OF DEMAND AT FIRST APPEAL STAGE 

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC], DATED 29-2-2016

Instruction No. 1914 dated 21-3-1996 contains guidelines issued by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of demand. 

2. In part 'C' of the Instruction, it has been prescribed that a demand will be stayed only if there are valid reasons for doing so and that mere filing of an appeal against the assessment order will not be a sufficient reason to stay the recovery of demand. It has been further prescribed that while granting stay, the field officers may require the assessee to offer a suitable security (bank guarantee, etc.) and/ or require the assessee to pay a reasonable amount in lump sum or in instalments. 

3. It has been reported that the field authorities often insist on payment of a very high proportion of the disputed demand before granting stay of the balance demand. This often results in hardship for the taxpayers seeking stay of demand. 

4. In order to streamline the process of grant of stay and standardize the quantum of lump sum payment required to be made by the assessee as a pre-condition for stay of demand disputed before CIT (A), the following modified guidelines are being issued in partial modification of Instruction No. 1914: 

(A) In a case where the outstanding demand is disputed before CIT (A), the assessing officer shall grant stay of demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B) hereunder. 

    (B) In a situation where, 
(a) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that payment of a lump sum amount higher than 15% is warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same issue has been confirmed by appellate authorities in earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of Revenue or addition is based on credible evidence collected in a search or survey operation, etc.) or, 

(b) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that payment of a lump sum amount lower than 15% is warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same issue has been deleted by appellate authorities in earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the assessee, etc.), the assessing officer shall refer the matter to the administrative Pr. CIT/CIT, who after considering all relevant facts shall decide the quantum/proportion of demand to be paid by the assessee as lump sum payment for granting a stay of the balance demand. 

(C) In a case where stay of demand is granted by the assessing officer on payment of 15% of the disputed demand and the assessee is still aggrieved, he may approach the jurisdictional administrative Pr. CIT/CIT for a review of the decision of the assessing officer.

(D) The assessing officer shall dispose of a stay petition within 2 weeks of filing of the petition. If a reference has been made to Pr. CIT/CIT under para 4 (B) above or a review petition has been filed by the assessee under para 4 (C) above, the same shall also be disposed of by the Pr. CIT/CIT within 2 weeks of the assessing officer making such reference or the assessee filing such review, as the case may be. 

(E) In granting stay, the Assessing Officer may impose such conditions as he may think fit. He may, inter alia,- 

(i) require an undertaking from the assessee that he will cooperate in the early disposal of appeal failing which the stay order will be cancelled; 

(ii) reserve the right to review the order passed after expiry of reasonable period (say 6 months) or if the assessee has not co-operated in the early disposal of appeal, or where a subsequent pronouncement by a higher appellate authority or court alters the above situations; 

(iii) reserve the right to adjust refunds arising, if any, against the demand, to the extent of the amount required for granting stay and subject to the provisions of section 245. 

5. These instructions/guidelines may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your jurisdiction for proper compliance.

11. In our considered opinion, the respondents have proceeded on a wholly incorrect and untenable premise that the assessee was obliged to tender or place evidence of having deposited 20% of the disputed demand before its application for stay under Section 220(6) of the Act could have been considered. The interpretation which is sought to be accorded to the aforesaid OM is clearly misconceived for the following reasons.
12. It must at the outset be noted that the two OMs noticed above neither prescribe nor mandate 15% or 20% of the outstanding demand as the case may be, being deposited as a pre-condition for grant of stay. The OM dated 29 February 2016 specifically spoke of a discretion vesting in the AO to grant stay subject to a deposit at a rate higher or lower than 15% dependent upon the facts of a particular case. The subsequent OM merely amended the rate to be 20%. In fact, while the subsequent OM chose to describe the 20% deposit to be the standard rate, the same would clearly not sustain in light of the discussion which ensues. 
13. We note that while dealing with an identical question, we had in Avantha Realty Ltd. vs The Principal Commissioner of Income Tax Central Delhi 2 & Anr.7  observed as under:
2. We note that the impugned orders are principally based on the instructions of the Central Board of Direct Tax [CBDT] as encapsulated in the Office Memorandum dated 31 July 2017 and which had while dealing with the manner in which the power under Section 220(6) of the Act is liable to be exercised had held that assessees may be accorded interim protection subject to deposit of 20% of the total outstanding demand failing which they would be treated as an assessee in default. 
3. Insofar as the aforesaid Office Memorandum is concerned, suffice it to note that while considering its ambit the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and Others vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited had held as follows:-
1. Delay condoned. Leave Granted.
 2. Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi-judicial authority, we only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal. 
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of.

14. As is manifest from the order passed by the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. vs LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd.8, it had been emphasized that the administrative circular would not operate as a fetter upon the power otherwise conferred on a quasi-judicial authority and that it would be wholly incorrect to view the OM as mandating the deposit of 20%, irrespective of the facts of an individual case. This would also flow from the clear and express language employed in sub-section (6) of Section 220 which speaks of the Assessing Officer9 being empowered in his discretion and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to impose in the circumstances of the case.  The discretion thus vested in the hands of the AO is one which cannot possibly be viewed as being cabined by the terms of the OM. 
15. The issue of a grant of stay pending appellate remedies being pursued arose for the consideration of a Division Bench of the Court in  Dabur India Limited vs Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) & Anr.10, where it was pertinently observed as under:
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the two Office Memorandums, in question, this Court is of the view that the requirement of payment of twenty percent of disputed tax demand is not a pre-requisite for putting in abeyance recovery of demand pending first appeal in all cases. The said pre-condition of deposit of twenty percent of the demand can be relaxed in appropriate cases. Even the Office Memorandum dated 29 February, 2016 gives instances like where addition on the same issue has been deleted by the appellate authorities in earlier years or where the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the assessee.

xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

8. In the present case, the impugned order is non-reasoned. The three basic principles i.e. the prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury have not been considered while deciding the stay application.

16. More recently in Indian National Congress vs Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Central  19 & Ors.11 we had an occasion to examine the scope of the power conferred by Section 220(6) of the Act and which was explained in the following terms:
22. However, as we read the order impugned, the matter does not appear to have proceeded along those lines before the ITAT. The tone and tenor of submissions clearly appear to have been concentrated upon the merits of the assessment order. Although the issue of payment of 20% of the outstanding demand appears to have been raised, the same came to be summarily rejected by the ITAT in cryptic terms. Notwithstanding the above, it becomes pertinent to observe that the 20% deposit which is spoken of in the OM dated 31 July 2017 is not liable to be viewed as a condition etched in stone or one which is inviolable. The OM merely seeks to provide guidance to the authorities to bear in mind certain aspects while considering applications for stay of demand pending an appeals remedy being pursued. The OM is not liable to be read as conferring an indefeasible right upon the assessee to claim a stay of a tax liability by merely offering or consenting to deposit 20% of the outstanding liability. Ultimately, it is for the authorities to examine and consider what amount would be sufficient to securitise the interest of the Revenue and thus a just balance being struck. The quantum of the deposit that would be required to be made would ultimately depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. This is evident from the order of the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and others Vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited and which is extracted hereunder: -
1. Delay condoned. Leave granted.

2. Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi-judicial authority, we only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal.

3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of.

23. The position which thus emerges is that while 20% is not liable to be viewed as an entrenched or inflexible rule, there could be circumstances where the respondents may be justified in seeking a deposit in excess of the above dependent upon the facts and circumstances that may obtain. This would have to necessarily be left to the sound exercise of discretion by the respondents based upon a consideration of issues such as prima facie, financial hardship and the likelihood of success. This observation we render being conscious of the indisputable position that the OM applies only upto the stage of the appeal pending before the CIT(A) and being of little significance when it comes to the ITAT. 

17. As explained in Indian National Congress, the 20% which is spoken of in the OM cannot possibly be viewed as being an inviolate or inflexible condition. The extent of the deposit which an assessee may be called upon to make would have to be examined and answered bearing in mind factors such as prima facie case, undue hardship and likelihood of success. We note that while dealing with the question of the claim of stay as made by an assessee and the competing obligation to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Supreme Court in Benara Valves Ltd. & Ors. Vs Commissioner of Central Excise & Anr.12 had elucidated the legal position in the following words:
6. Principles relating to grant of stay pending disposal of the matters before the forums concerned have been considered in several cases. It is to be noted that in such matters though discretion is available, the same has to be exercised judicially.
7. The applicable principles have been set out succinctly in Silliguri Municipality v. Amalendu Das and Samarias Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. S. Samuel and CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd. 
8. It is true that on merely establishing a prima facie case, interim order of protection should not be passed. But if on a cursory glance it appears that the demand raised has no leg to stand on, it would be undesirable to require the assessee to pay full or substantive part of the demand. Petitions for stay should not be disposed of in a routine matter unmindful of the consequences flowing from the order requiring the assessee to deposit full or part of the demand. There can be no rule of universal application in such matters and the order has to be passed keeping in view the factual scenario involved. Merely because this Court has indicated the principles that does not give a license to the forum/authority to pass an order which cannot be sustained on the touchstone of fairness, legality and public interest. Where denial of interim relief may lead to public mischief, grave irreparable private injury or shake a citizens faith in the impartiality of public administration, interim relief can be given.
9. It has become an unfortunate trend to casually dispose of stay applications by referring to decisions in Siliguri Municipality and Dunlop India cases without analysing factual scenario involved in a particular case.
xxxx			xxxx				xxxx
11. Two significant expressions used in the provisions are ""undue hardship to such person"" and ""safeguard the interests of Revenue"". Therefore, while dealing with the application twin requirements of considerations i.e. consideration of undue hardship aspect and imposition of conditions to safeguard the interest of Revenue have to be kept in view.
12. As noted above there are two important expressions in Section 35-F. One is undue hardship. This is a matter within the special knowledge of the applicant for waiver and has to be established by him. A mere assertion about undue hardship would not be sufficient. It was noted by this Court in S. Vasudeva v. State of Karnataka that under Indian conditions expression ""undue hardship"" is normally related to economic hardship. ""Undue"" which means something which is not merited by the conduct of the claimant, or is very much disproportionate to it. Undue hardship is caused when the hardship is not warranted by the circumstances.
13. For a hardship to be 'undue' it must be shown that the particular burden to observe or perform the requirement is out of proportion to the nature of the requirement itself, and the benefit which the applicant would derive from compliance with it.
14. The word ""undue"" adds something more than just hardship. It means an excessive hardship or a hardship greater than the circumstances warrant.
15. The other aspect relates to imposition of condition to safeguard the interest of Revenue. This is an aspect which the Tribunal has to bring into focus. It is for the Tribunal to impose such conditions as are deemed proper to safeguard the interests of the Revenue. Therefore, the Tribunal while dealing with the application has to consider materials to be placed by the assessee relating to undue hardship and also to stipulate condition as required to safeguard the interest of the Revenue.

The aforesaid principles were reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Monotosh Saha vs Special Director, Enforcement Directorate & Anr.13
18. We find a lucid explanation of the legal position with respect to pre-deposit and the grant of stay in a decision rendered by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in ITC Ltd v. Commissioner (Appeals), Customs & Central Excise14 where the Court had held as follows:
18. In Income-tax Officer v. M.K. Mohammad Kunhi, AIR 1969 SC 430, the Apex Court held that stay should be granted if a strong prima facie case has been made out and in the most deserving and appropriate cases where entire purpose of the appeal will be frustrated or rendered nugatory by allowing the recovery proceedings to continue, during the pendency of the appeal.

19. In B.P.L. Sanyo Utilities and Appliances Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 621, the Karnataka High Court held that in the matter of grant of waiver of pre-deposit, each case has to be examined on its own merit and no hard and fast rule can be formulated.
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

21. In Mehsana District Cooperative Milk P.U. Ltd. v. Union of India, 2003 (154) E.L.T. 347 (S.C.), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the case of dispensation of pre-deposit condition and held that the Appellate Authority must address to itself to the prima facie merits of the appellant's case and upon being satisfied of the same, determine the quantum of deposit taking into consideration the financial hardship and other such related factors.
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

23. In J.N. Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. CEGAT, 1991 (53) E.L.T. 543, the Calcutta High Court while considering the provisions of pre-deposit of duty and penalty, observed that where the authority concerned comes to the conclusion that the appellant has a good prima facie case so as to justify the dispensation of requirement of pre-deposit of the disputed amount on duty and penalty, the authority must exercise its discretion to dispense with such requirement particularly in a case where the appellant satisfies the authority concerned that its case is squarely covered by the decision of a competent Court binding on it. In such an eventuality, asking the appellant to deposit the duty demanded and penalty levied would undoubtedly cause undue hardship to the appellant. While deciding the said case, Calcutta High Court placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in L. Hirday Narain v. Income-Tax Officer, Bareilly, (1970) 2 SCC 355 : AIR 1971 SC 33, wherein the Court observed as under:
If a statute invests a public officer with authority to do an act in a specified set of circumstances, it is imperative upon him to exercise his authority in a manner appropriate to the case when a party interested and having a right to apply moved in that behalf and circumstances for exercise of authority are shown to exist. Even if the words used in the statute prima facie enabling, the courts will readily infer a duty to exercise power which is invested in aid of enforcement of a right-public or private-of a citizen.

24. Thus, even where enabling or discretionary power is conferred on a public authority, the words which are permissive in character, require to be constituted, involving a duty to exercise that power, if some legal right or entitlement is conferred or enjoyed, and for the effectuating the such right or entitlement, the exercise of such power is essential. The aforesaid view stands fortified in view of that fact that every power is coupled with a duty to act reasonably and the Court/Tribunal/Authority has to proceed having strict adherence to the provisions of law. [Vide Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford, (1880) 5 Appeal Cases 214; Commissioner of Police, Bombay v. Gordhandas Bhanji, 1951 SCC 1088 : AIR 1952 SC 16; K.S. Sriniva-san v. Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 419; Yogeshwar Jaiswal v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, (1985) 1 SCC 725 : AIR 1985 SC 516; Ambica Quarry Works etc. v. State of Gujarat, (1987) 1 SCC 213 : AIR 1987 SC 1073].
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

26. In Bongaigaon Refinery & Petrochem Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise (A), 1994 (69) E.L.T. 193 (Cal.), the Calcutta High Court, while examining a similar issue and placed reliance upon a large number of judgments and held that the phrase undue hardship would cover a case where the appellant has a strong prima facie case. The phrase also covers a situation where there is an arguable case in the appeal. If the Appellate Authority forms the opinion that appellant has a strong prima facie case, it should dispense with the pre-deposit condition altogether. However, where it is of the opinion that the appellant has no arguable case, the Appellate Authority must safeguard the interest of the Revenue, as the same also cannot be jeopardised.

27. In Sri Krishna v. Union of India, 1998 (104) E.L.T. 305, Delhi High Court considered the issue of dispensation of pre-deposit condition and the concept of undue hardship while considering the provisions of Section 129E of the Customs Act, 1962 and Section 35 of the Act and held that the Court while considering the case of the appellant should examine as to whether the Appellate Authority or Tribunal have dealt with the plea raised by the appellant before it and have considered as to whether the appellant has a prima facie case on merit. In case the appellant has a strong prima facie case, as is most likely to exonerate him from liability and the Appellate Authority/Tribunal insists on the deposit of the amount, it would amount to undue hardship.

28. In Hoogly Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 637, the Calcutta High Court again reiterated the view that if the appellant has a strong prima facie case, he is entitled of waiving the pre-deposit condition and in case the Appellate Authority insists to deposit the amount so assessed or penalty so levied, it will cause undue hardship to the assessee. While considering the said case, the Court placed reliance upon the large number of judgments including Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner (Appeals), Central Excise, 1998 (98) E.L.T. 50; Hari Fertilizer v. Union of India, 1985 (22) E.L.T. 301 (All.); Re. American Refrigeration Co. Ltd., 1986 (23) E.L.T. 74; and V.I.T. Sea Foods v. Collector of Customs, 1989 (42) E.L.T. 220 (Ker.), wherein the Courts had expressed the similar view.

29. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs (Appeals)ILR 2000 KAR 25, while examining the issue of pre-deposit under Section 35 of the Act, after considering a large number of judgments of the Apex Court and various High Courts, it was held as under:
While considering the case of undue hardship, the authority is required to examine the prima facie on merits of the dispute as well. Pleading of financial disability would not be the only consideration. Where the case is fully covered in favour of the assessee by a biding precedent like that of the judgment of the Supreme Court, jurisdictional High Court or a Special Bench of the Tribunal, then to still insist upon the deposit of duty and penalty levied would certainly cause undue hardship to the assessee. Absence of the financial hardship in such a case would be no ground to decline the dispensation of pre-deposit under the proviso to Section 35F. The power to dispense with such deposit is conferred under the authorities has to be exercised precisely in cases like this type and if it is not exercised under such circumstances then this Court will require it to be exercised. Such like cases where two views are not possible then the condition of pre-deposit before the appeal is heard on merits, can be dispensed with. In case two views are possible on interpretation, based on conflicting judgments of the Tribunal or different High Courts in the absence of the judgment of the jurisdictional High Court then the authorities may pass the order under proviso to Section 35F of the Act keeping in view the facts of the case in hand.
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

35. In view of the above, the aforesaid authorities make it clear that the Court should not grant interim relief/stay of the recovery merely by asking of a party. It has to maintain a balance between the rights of an individual and the State so far as the recovery of sovereign dues is concerned. While considering the application for stay/waiver of a pre-deposit, as required under the law, the Court must apply its mind as to whether the appellant has a strong prima facie case on merit. In case it is covered by the judgment of a Court/Tribunal binding upon the Appellate Authority, it should apply its mind as to whether in view of the said judgment, the appellant is likely to succeed on merit. If an appellant having strong prima facie case, is asked to deposit the amount of assessment so made or penalty so levied, it would cause undue hardship to him, though there may be no financial restrain on the appellant running in a good financial condition. The arguments that appellant is in a position to deposit or if he succeeds in appeal, he will be entitled to get the refund, are not the considerations for deciding the application. The order of the Appellate Authority itself must show that it had applied its mind to the issue raised by the appellant and it has been considered in accordance with the law. The expression undue hardship has a wider connotation as it takes within its ambit the case where the assessee is asked to deposit the amount even if he is likely to exonerate from the total liability on disposal of his appeal. Dispensation of deposit should also be allowed where two views are possible. While considering the application for interim relief, the Court must examine all pros and cons involved in the case and further examine that in case recovery is not stayed, the right of appeal conferred by the legislature and refusal to exercise the discretionary power by the authority to stay/waive the predeposit condition, would be reduced to nugatory/illusory. Undoubtedly, the interest of the Revenue cannot be jeopardized but that does not mean that in order to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Court or authority should exercise its duty under the law to take into consideration the rights and interest of an in dividual. It is also clear that before any goods could be subjected to duty, it has to be established that it has been manufactured and it is marketable and to prove that it is marketable, the burden is on the Revenue and not on the manufacturer.

19. Though some of the decisions noticed by us hereinabove pertained to pre-deposit prescriptions placed by a statute, the principles enunciated therein would clearly be of relevance while examining the extent of the power that stands placed in the hands of the AO in terms of Section 220(6) of the Act. In our considered opinion, the respondents have clearly erred in proceeding on the assumption that the application for consideration of outstanding demands being placed in abeyance could not have even been entertained without a 20% pre-deposit. The aforesaid stand as taken is thoroughly misconceived and wholly untenable in law. 
20. Undisputedly, and on the date when the impugned adjustments came to be made, the application moved by the petitioner referable to Section 220(6) of the Act had neither been considered nor disposed of. The respondents have thus in our considered opinion clearly acted arbitrarily in proceeding to adjust the demand for AY 2018-19 against available refunds without attending to that application. This action of the respondents is wholly arbitrary and unfair. The intimation of adjustments being proposed would hardly be of any relevance or consequence once it is found that the application for stay remained pending and the said fact is not an issue of contestation. 
21. We consequently allow the instant writ petition and remit the matter to the respondents for considering the application of the petitioner under Section 220(6) in accordance with the observations made hereinabove. The issue of the amount of refund liable to be released shall abide by the decision which the respondents shall now take pursuant to the directions framed hereinabove.

Mar ital bonds are delicate emotional human relationship s and 
involvement of any third pe rson could result in complete collapse of 
trust, faith, and tranquillity. Any sort of influence by a third person can 
just be a silent destroyer of the bond , leading to prolonged 
irreconcilable differences. Such relations eventually become a ticking 
time b omb,  where feelings of anguish, despair, rejection and 
disappointment get trapped and post explosion , the shrapnel  of these 
suppressed feelings  causes injur y to everyone  involved , whether directly 
or indirectly.  
1. The present  Appeal under Order 41 Rule 1 CP C, 1908 has been filed 
on behalf of the appellant/ husband  against the Judgment dated 21.12.1999  of 
the learned Additional District Judge, denying the  divorce  on the ground of  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 2 of 11 
 cruelty in a petition filed by the appellant /husband  (Petitioner in the Divorce 
Petition)  unde r Section 13(1)  (ia) of HMA .  
2. Briefly stated , the parties got married on 06.12.1982 and were 
blessed with a da ughter and a son on 26 .09.1984 and 26.08.1991 
respectively.  
3. The appellant/petitioner  (husband)  had asserted in his Divorce 
Petition  that the respondent was disrespectful and refused to take care of 
him and even assaulted him physically.  She was in a habit of extracting 
money and forced him to give expensive gifts to her relatives and had no 
affection towards him or his family members.  It was asserted that the 
respondent went to Patiala on 16.06.1992 on a false pretext of illness of her 
mother while the appellant had to go to Kaza for his office work.  
Subsequently, he came to know that her younger sister had gone missing for 
the last t hree days and a false pretext of illness of mother had been told to 
him.  On return from Kaza, he stopped at the house of respondent’s family 
in Patiala and tried to coun sel the family  to let the sister marry the man with 
whom she had gone, but he was not appreciated for his concern and was 
threatened with divorce and ridiculed in filthy language by the resp ondent 
and the family members.  
4. On a pervious occasion , she quarreled with him when his sister got 
married on 03.01.198 7 at Arya Samaj Mandir, Vasant Vi har, and advised 
him to not  attend the wedding  of his own sister.  
5. The appellant had further asserted that while he was operated in G.M. 
Modi Hospital on 15.07.1993 for Appendicitis, the respondent quarreled 
with him despite him being in terrible pain and w as forced by the ward staff 
to leave the hospit al.  She made false allegations  of appellant leading an  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 3 of 11 
 immoral life and even made  false and baseless allegations of him having an 
illicit relationship with one Ms. B.S.,  in her complaint dated 04.07.1994 
filed before Women Cell, P.S. Hauz Khas, Delhi.  
6. The appellant asserted that on 02.07.1994 while he returned from 
Bhopal, the respondent along with her parents and sister came to his house 
and they threatened him with his life.  The respondent thereafter , stopped 
performing her conjugal duties for more than two years and they started 
living separately in the room , though in the same house.  
7. The appellant asserted that because of s uch conduct of the respondent 
his peace of mind was shattere d and he was compelled  to do all the 
household work including cooking and taking care  of the children.  He thus, 
sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.  
8. The respondent /wife  in her Written Statement  asserted that by 
filing the Divorce Petition, he was seeking to take advantage of his own 
wrongs.  Essentially, it is asserted that their relationship was cordial till the 
appellant  allegedly got into an illegitimate relationship with his colleague 
Ms. B.S. When she came to know about it in 1993, differences cropped up 
between them . It is asserted that because of this illegitimate affair the 
appellant himself started living in a separate room and started ill treating her 
and made her life miserable since December, 1993.   
9. The resp ondent further asserted that Shri N.R.S, father of Ms. B.S., 
also made various representations to the Director of NIEPA, where the 
appellant was employed aside from representation to Secretary, Department 
of Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Police and also 
to Legal Aid and Advice Board, Pati ala House Courts, New Delhi about the 
appellant ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.   
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 4 of 11 
 10. Thereafter, the appellant left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 and 
started residing with  Ms. B.S. and the two children at Malviya Nagar, New 
Delhi.  It is claimed that they were living as husband and wife and the 
children were forced to address Ms. B.S. as mother.  The respondent even 
came to know that Ms. B.S.  was in family way.  
11. The respondent denied all the allegations of being quarrelsome that 
were made by the app ellant against her.  She asserted that she discharged all 
her matrimonial duties with sincerity, but the discord was only on account of 
the illegitimate affair of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  She admitted making a 
compl aint on 04.07.1994 to CAW Cell, howev er, she  mentioned that it was 
made because her  children had been removed from her custody in a 
clandestine manner.  She further clarified that it was the appellant who 
stopped maintaining conjugal relationship and he finally left the matrimonial 
home on 11 .08.1994 on account of his illegitimate relationship.  In fact, on 
the same day he and Ms. B.S.  also left their job at NIEPA.  It was therefore 
claimed that appellant was not entitled to Divorce.  
12. The appellant in his replication  denied all the allegations o f illicit 
relationship and claimed them to be defamatory.   He submitted that he even 
filed a complaint under Section 500 IPC which was pending disposal before 
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate , Delhi.  He further asserted that the 
parents of   Ms. B.S had  come to the hostel where Ms. B.S. was residing and 
gave public beating to her at the bus stop of Ganga Hostel and was dragged 
to the parked vehicle.  The appellant had tried to intervene and pacified the 
parents of Ms. B.S. on which they got upset and mad e wild allegations 
against his character.   He explained that Ms. B.S. had been engaged by him 
only as a governess to the children.  He reiterated his allegations of cruelty  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 5 of 11 
 against the respondent/wife.  
13. Issues  were framed on 04.12.1996  as under : 
“(i) Whethe r the respondent has treated the 
petitioner with cruelty after solemnization of marriage?  
(ii) Relief.” 
 
14. The appellant appeared as PW1  and Ms. B.S. as PW2  as well as  Mr. 
N.C. S ., father of Ms. B.S as CW1. The respondent appeared as RW1  and 
also examined Ms . Bharti as RW2 , H.C. Dal Chand as RW3 , Shri Prem Pal 
official of Syndicate Bank as RW4 , Mr. G.S. Bhardwaj, Administrative 
Officer of NIEPA as RW5 , Mrs. Kusum, Ahlmad from the Court of learned 
Metropolitan Magistrate as RW6 , Ms. Saroj Bala Sub Inspector of  Delhi 
Police as RW7 , Ms. Surbi Sarkar, sister of Ms. B.S. as RW8 , Ramesh 
Chand, LDC from the Office of Delhi Legal Aid & Advice Board as RW9  
and  Mrs. Bindu Khandelwa l as RW10.    
15. The learned ADJ  after referring to the evidence and documents 
concluded  that the relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. was in 
the nature that would cause one to believe that they had a relationship of 
husband and wife , which was unlawful, unauthorized and not sanctioned by 
rule and custom  and the possibility of sexual re lationship between them 
could not be over ruled. Hence, the suspicion of the respondent was not held 
to be baseless and her conduct towards the appellant was not found to be 
cruel entitling him to a decree of divorce.  The divorce petition was 
accordingly dismissed.  
16. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Divorce Petition, the appellant/ 
husband has preferred the present Appeal.  
17. Learned counsel for the appellant , in support of his averments in the  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 6 of 11 
 present appeal, has placed reliance  upon the judgment of Shilpa S hailesh vs.

No.4314 of 2012 of High Court of Karnataka, and sought a prayer for setting 
aside of decree dated 21.12.1999 and for grant of divorce under 13 (1) (ia) 
of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  
18. Submissions heard  and record perus ed. 
19. It has emerged from the testimony of the respondent that she and the 
appellant met while they were studying in JNU together for about a year and 
half prior to their marriage on 08.12.1982.  They wer e both blessed with a 
son and a daughter and apparently lived cordially and had a happy married 
life till about 1993.  Apparently, major differences started emerging between 
them in the year 1994.  
20. It is one of those unfortunate cases where after the marria ge of the 
parties on 06.12.1982 , the relation inter se  them could remain stable till 
about December, 1993.   Life in all its uncertainties , unfolded when despite 
having a cordial married life for sufficiently long period of 10 years, 
apparently the appellan t developed affection for his colleague Ms. B.S. who 
was working in the same office , and that was the point when the entire world 
of the respondent came down shattering.  The appellant himself has stated 
that the respondent started making allegations of il licit relationship with Ms. 
B.S.  However, these allegations were not unfounded, as is borne out from 
the evidence on record.     
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 7 of 11 
 21. The appellant was admittedly admitted in G.M. Modi Hospital on 
15.07.1993 and was operated for acute Appendicitis.  According to  him, the 
respondent arrived in the hospital and had a quarrel because of which she 
was forced out of the Ward by the hospital staff.  The respondent has denied 
this incident vehemently in her testimony who has rather deposed that she 
took full care of the  appellant while he was admitted in the hospital . 
22. It is evide nt from the respective testimonies  of the  parties that  the 
dispute inter -se the parties had the genesis in the association of the appellant 
with Ms. B.S. She admittedly came to be known to the ap pellant while she 
was working in Indian Institute of Statistics in which the appellant himself 
admits he had an association.  Sub sequently, Ms. B.S. got appointed in 
NIEPA, where the appellant was also working.  Their intimacy became more 
while working tog ether, which is evident from the admission of the 
appellant that he used to  take her along with him on the official tours and 
had even taken her to Kaza along with the children.  He while returning 
from Kaza had gone with her and the children to the parent -in-law’s house 
in Patiala.  He has also admitted that many a times she used to accompany 
him for various official tours , but has tried to explain it by asserting that she 
had accompanied him only as Junior Associate.  
23. The appellant  has denied vehemently th at he had any illicit 
relationship with her, but his own contentions get defeated by his own 
admission in the petition that she came to live with him in his house in 
Malviya Nagar . The appellant gave a fantastic explanation that she had 
shifted with him as  a governess to take care of the children.  According to 
the appellant, he had paid her Rs.15,000/ - per month for the job.  
Interestingly, Ms. B.S. was herself a government employee working in  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 8 of 11 
 NEIPA and she being employed as a governess and even been alleg edly paid 
Rs.15,000/ - is an explanation, which can  be only termed as absurd as it can 
be.   
24. In this context it would also be pertinent to refer to the testimony of 
RW2 , Ms. Bharti , a family friend who had also deposed that when she had 
visited the house of  the appellant in the year 1994 -95, she not only saw Ms. 
B.S. present in the house maintaining it like a housewife, but the children 
were addressing her as ""mother "".  
25.  Another material witness examined by the respondent was RW8 
Surbhi Sarkar , elder sister of Ms. B.S. who also had deposed that her 
younger sister , Ms. B.S. , had been residing in the house of the appellant with 
him since 1994.  She also deposed that it was this relationship between the 
appellant and Ms. B.S. which became a cause of trouble in t heir family as 
was reflected in the various letters and complaints sent by her father to 
various Authorities.  The relationship had perturbed the family a lot.  
26. Aside from the admissions made in the petition as well as the 
testimony by the appellant  and oth er witnesses , there is other overwhelming 
documentary evidence.  The appellant  has admitted that while he was 
residing in Malviya Nagar, complaints had been made by the neighbors  
questioning the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  A complaint was 
made by the neighbors  to the police vide Diary No.1966 of 30.11.1994 
which is 'Mark A ' and had been produced by PW3 H .C. Daal Chand.   
Subsequently, the  appellant  had sought to explain this complaint by claiming 
that this was withdrawn vide letter Ex.PW1/R1 .  The complaint may have 
been  withdrawn subsequently and the appellant may have tried to explain 
that the neighbors  eventually were convinced about his association with Ms.  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 9 of 11 
 B.S and had withdrawn their apprehension , but the fact remains that Ms. 
B.S. admit tedly came to reside with the appellant at Malviya Nagar to which 
there was an objection taken by the neighbors .   
27. The second set of documentary evidence , which is revealing about the 
relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S. , are the complaints written by 
none other than Mr. N.C.S.,  father of Ms. B.S. , to the Department of NEIPA,  
the Police,  the Delhi Legal Aid  Board  and other Agencies alleging that the 
appellant was ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.   Interestingly, Mr. 
N.C.S was present in the C ourt at that time when the testimony of RPW2 
Ms. B.S. was recorded at the instance of the appellant,  and his testimony 
was also recorded as CW1.  Pertinently, he admitted having writte n the letter 
Ex.RW5/1  to NEIPA and Ex.RW8/6  as well as document Ex.RW8/P 1 to 
Delhi Legal Services Authority . Additionally,  Ex.RW6/1  and Ex.RW6/2, 
which are his statement s recorded in FIR No. 313/94 revea l that Ms. B.S. 
was made hostile to her family and was being influenced by the appellant . In 
all these letters /documents , not only had he taken an objection of his 
daughter who was much younger , having unacceptable friendship with the 
appellant  but has  also stated that the appellant has mislead her and even 
proposed to marry Ms. B.S.  However, in his cross -examination, he tried  to 
back track by asserting that all those complaints were made due to 
misunderstanding.  
28. All these complaints which are contemporary to the incidents 
happening , have been written from 04.03.1994  onwards .  It is quite apparent 
that subsequently, the appella nt was able to prevail upon not only Ms. B.S. 
but also on her father who were examined as RPW -1 as the witness of the 
appellant  and CW -1 as the witness by the Court,  on 31.08.1998.   
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 10 of 11 
 29.  The very fact that the complaints are all admitted by CW1 , Mr. 
N.C.S ,  clearly corroborate the averments of the respondent about the 
appellant having developed affection with Ms. B.S. outside his marriage 
with the respondent.  The appellant may have been able to win over the 
father of Ms. B.S. during the pendency of the divorce  proceedings, but the 
claim of the respondent of appellant having developed relationship outside 
the marriage is fully corroborated and supported not only by the oral 
testimony, but also by the documents.   
30. The overwhelming evidence on record reflects that  indeed the 
appellant who got i nvolved with Ms. B.S. since 1994  and left the house in 
August , 1994 was the one who had committed the cruelty upon the 
respondent.  The respondent wife cannot be penalized for making such 
allegations and protesting about the relationship which have a strong basis 
and foundation.  In fact, she had a justification to complain about the 
conduct of the appellant and to take any view otherwise would indeed b e 
committing cruelty upon the respondent.  
31. It becomes apposite to mention th at an FIR No.313/1992 under 
Section 498A/406 IPC had been registered against the appellant, his sister 
and brother -in-law and while the sister and brother -in-law were discharged 
at the time of framing of charge s, the appellant has been subsequently 
acquitt ed vide judgment dated 03.05.2013. However, considering the 
overwhelming evidence revealing the relationship with Ms. B.S., this   
acquittal  subsequent to the divorce  itself , cannot be a ground to say in the 
peculiar facts of this case , that any kind of cru elty had been committed upon 
him by the respondent.  Merely because there is an acquittal by a Criminal 
Court, does not wash away the cruelty  committed by the appellant  of being  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 11 of 11 
 involved with a young girl during the subsistence of his marriage with the 
respondent ; mere acquittal in a criminal case cannot be a ground to grant 
divorce.  
32. We, in the light of blatant conduct of the appellant is showing scant 
regard to his matrimonial relationship, are compelled to observe that despite 
it being a failed marriage o f over 40 years, granting Divorce would be 
adding a premium to the wrong acts of the appellant. While the human 
emotions  know no bounds and rules, but definitely the human sensibilities 
emanating from the mind should have prevailed for an educated person like 
the appellant to have reigned his affections for a third person, with scant 
regard for the respondent who had reposed complete faith by entering into 
the vows of marriage with him.  This is one case where S. 23(1)(a) of the  
HMA, 1955 , which provides th at no person can take advantage of its own 
wrong , comes into play, in full force.  
33. We hereby conclude that t he learned Additional District Judge 
has rightly concluded that it is the appellant who is responsible for acts 
of cruelty towards the respondent an d had rejected the divorce petition.  
34. Accordingly, t here is no merit in the present Appeal, which is hereby 
dismissed  along with pending application(s) , if any.

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J. 
Marital bonds are delicate emotional human relationships and involvement of any third person could result in complete collapse of trust, faith, and tranquillity. Any sort of influence by a third person can just be a silent destroyer of the bond, leading to prolonged irreconcilable differences. Such relations eventually become a ticking time bomb, where feelings of anguish, despair, rejection and disappointment get trapped and post explosion, the shrapnel of these suppressed feelings causes injury to everyone involved, whether directly or indirectly. 
1. The present Appeal under Order 41 Rule 1 CPC, 1908 has been filed on behalf of the appellant/husband against the Judgment dated 21.12.1999 of the learned Additional District Judge, denying the divorce on the ground of cruelty in a petition filed by the appellant/husband (Petitioner in the Divorce Petition) under Section 13(1) (ia) of HMA. 
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married on 06.12.1982 and were blessed with a daughter and a son on 26.09.1984 and 26.08.1991 respectively.
3. The appellant/petitioner (husband) had asserted in his Divorce Petition that the respondent was disrespectful and refused to take care of him and even assaulted him physically.  She was in a habit of extracting money and forced him to give expensive gifts to her relatives and had no affection towards him or his family members.  It was asserted that the respondent went to Patiala on 16.06.1992 on a false pretext of illness of her mother while the appellant had to go to Kaza for his office work.  Subsequently, he came to know that her younger sister had gone missing for the last three days and a false pretext of illness of mother had been told to him.  On return from Kaza, he stopped at the house of respondents family in Patiala and tried to counsel the family to let the sister marry the man with whom she had gone, but he was not appreciated for his concern and was threatened with divorce and ridiculed in filthy language by the respondent and the family members. 
4. On a pervious occasion, she quarreled with him when his sister got married on 03.01.1987 at Arya Samaj Mandir, Vasant Vihar, and advised him to not attend the wedding of his own sister.
5. The appellant had further asserted that while he was operated in G.M. Modi Hospital on 15.07.1993 for Appendicitis, the respondent quarreled with him despite him being in terrible pain and was forced by the ward staff to leave the hospital.  She made false allegations of appellant leading an immoral life and even made  false and baseless allegations of him having an illicit relationship with one Ms. B.S.,  in her complaint dated 04.07.1994 filed before Women Cell, P.S. Hauz Khas, Delhi.
6. The appellant asserted that on 02.07.1994 while he returned from Bhopal, the respondent along with her parents and sister came to his house and they threatened him with his life.  The respondent thereafter, stopped performing her conjugal duties for more than two years and they started living separately in the room, though in the same house.
7. The appellant asserted that because of such conduct of the respondent his peace of mind was shattered and he was compelled to do all the household work including cooking and taking care of the children.  He thus, sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.
8. The respondent/wife in her Written Statement asserted that by filing the Divorce Petition, he was seeking to take advantage of his own wrongs.  Essentially, it is asserted that their relationship was cordial till the appellant allegedly got into an illegitimate relationship with his colleague Ms. B.S. When she came to know about it in 1993, differences cropped up between them. It is asserted that because of this illegitimate affair the appellant himself started living in a separate room and started ill treating her and made her life miserable since December, 1993.  
9. The respondent further asserted that Shri N.R.S, father of Ms. B.S., also made various representations to the Director of NIEPA, where the appellant was employed aside from representation to Secretary, Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Police and also to Legal Aid and Advice Board, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi about the appellant ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.
10. Thereafter, the appellant left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 and started residing with Ms. B.S. and the two children at Malviya Nagar, New Delhi.  It is claimed that they were living as husband and wife and the children were forced to address Ms. B.S. as mother. The respondent even came to know that Ms. B.S. was in family way.
11. The respondent denied all the allegations of being quarrelsome that were made by the appellant against her.  She asserted that she discharged all her matrimonial duties with sincerity, but the discord was only on account of the illegitimate affair of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  She admitted making a complaint on 04.07.1994 to CAW Cell, however, she mentioned that it was made because her children had been removed from her custody in a clandestine manner.  She further clarified that it was the appellant who stopped maintaining conjugal relationship and he finally left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 on account of his illegitimate relationship.  In fact, on the same day he and Ms. B.S. also left their job at NIEPA. It was therefore claimed that appellant was not entitled to Divorce.
12. The appellant in his replication denied all the allegations of illicit relationship and claimed them to be defamatory.  He submitted that he even filed a complaint under Section 500 IPC which was pending disposal before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.  He further asserted that the parents of  Ms. B.S had come to the hostel where Ms. B.S. was residing and gave public beating to her at the bus stop of Ganga Hostel and was dragged to the parked vehicle.  The appellant had tried to intervene and pacified the parents of Ms. B.S. on which they got upset and made wild allegations against his character.  He explained that Ms. B.S. had been engaged by him only as a governess to the children.  He reiterated his allegations of cruelty against the respondent/wife.
13. Issues were framed on 04.12.1996 as under:
(i)	Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty after solemnization of marriage?
(ii)	Relief.

14. The appellant appeared as PW1 and Ms. B.S. as PW2 as well as Mr. N.C. S., father of Ms. B.S as CW1. The respondent appeared as RW1 and also examined Ms. Bharti as RW2, H.C. Dal Chand as RW3, Shri Prem Pal official of Syndicate Bank as RW4, Mr. G.S. Bhardwaj, Administrative Officer of NIEPA as RW5, Mrs. Kusum, Ahlmad from the Court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate as RW6, Ms. Saroj Bala Sub Inspector of Delhi Police as RW7, Ms. Surbi Sarkar, sister of Ms. B.S. as RW8, Ramesh Chand, LDC from the Office of Delhi Legal Aid & Advice Board as RW9 and  Mrs. Bindu Khandelwal as RW10.  
15. The learned ADJ after referring to the evidence and documents concluded that the relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. was in the nature that would cause one to believe that they had a relationship of husband and wife, which was unlawful, unauthorized and not sanctioned by rule and custom and the possibility of sexual relationship between them could not be over ruled. Hence, the suspicion of the respondent was not held to be baseless and her conduct towards the appellant was not found to be cruel entitling him to a decree of divorce.  The divorce petition was accordingly dismissed.
16. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Divorce Petition, the appellant/ husband has preferred the present Appeal. 
17. Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his averments in the present appeal, has placed reliance upon the judgment of Shilpa Shailesh vs. Varun Sreenivasan Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1118 of 214, Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli Appeal (Civil) 812 of 2004 of the Apex Court, Dishad Kushwaha vs. Rituraj Singh FAONO.653/2016 of High Court of Madhya Pradesh XXXX vs. XXXX MAT Appeal No.513/2021 of High Court of Kerala and K.

FAO No.4314 of 2012 of High Court of Karnataka, and sought a prayer for setting aside of decree dated 21.12.1999 and for grant of divorce under 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
18. Submissions heard and record perused.
19. It has emerged from the testimony of the respondent that she and the appellant met while they were studying in JNU together for about a year and half prior to their marriage on 08.12.1982.  They were both blessed with a son and a daughter and apparently lived cordially and had a happy married life till about 1993.  Apparently, major differences started emerging between them in the year 1994.
20. It is one of those unfortunate cases where after the marriage of the parties on 06.12.1982, the relation inter se them could remain stable till about December, 1993.  Life in all its uncertainties, unfolded when despite having a cordial married life for sufficiently long period of 10 years, apparently the appellant developed affection for his colleague Ms. B.S. who was working in the same office, and that was the point when the entire world of the respondent came down shattering.  The appellant himself has stated that the respondent started making allegations of illicit relationship with Ms. B.S.

The appellant has denied vehemently that he had any illicit relationship with her, but his own contentions get defeated by his own admission in the petition that she came to live with him in his house in Malviya Nagar. The appellant gave a fantastic explanation that she had shifted with him as a governess to take care of the children.  According to the appellant, he had paid her Rs.15,000/- per month for the job.  Interestingly, Ms. B.S. was herself a government employee working in NEIPA and she being employed as a governess and even been allegedly paid Rs.15,000/- is an explanation, which can be only termed as absurd as it can be.  
24. In this context it would also be pertinent to refer to the testimony of RW2, Ms. Bharti, a family friend who had also deposed that when she had visited the house of the appellant in the year 1994-95, she not only saw Ms. B.S. present in the house maintaining it like a housewife, but the children were addressing her as ""mother"". 
25.  Another material witness examined by the respondent was RW8 Surbhi Sarkar, elder sister of Ms. B.S. who also had deposed that her younger sister, Ms. B.S., had been residing in the house of the appellant with him since 1994.  She also deposed that it was this relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. which became a cause of trouble in their family as was reflected in the various letters and complaints sent by her father to various Authorities.  The relationship had perturbed the family a lot.
26. Aside from the admissions made in the petition as well as the testimony by the appellant and other witnesses, there is other overwhelming documentary evidence.  The appellant has admitted that while he was residing in Malviya Nagar, complaints had been made by the neighbors questioning the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  A complaint was made by the neighbors to the police vide Diary No.1966 of 30.11.1994 which is 'Mark A' and had been produced by PW3 H.C. Daal Chand.  Subsequently, the appellant had sought to explain this complaint by claiming that this was withdrawn vide letter Ex.PW1/R1.  The complaint may have been withdrawn subsequently and the appellant may have tried to explain that the neighbors eventually were convinced about his association with Ms. B.S and had withdrawn their apprehension, but the fact remains that Ms. B.S. admittedly came to reside with the appellant at Malviya Nagar to which there was an objection taken by the neighbors.  
27. The second set of documentary evidence, which is revealing about the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S., are the complaints written by none other than Mr. N.C.S., father of Ms. B.S., to the Department of NEIPA, the Police, the Delhi Legal Aid Board and other Agencies alleging that the appellant was ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.  Interestingly, Mr. N.C.S was present in the Court at that time when the testimony of RPW2 Ms. B.S. was recorded at the instance of the appellant, and his testimony was also recorded as CW1.  Pertinently, he admitted having written the letter Ex.RW5/1 to NEIPA and Ex.RW8/6 as well as document Ex.RW8/P1 to Delhi Legal Services Authority. Additionally, Ex.RW6/1 and Ex.RW6/2, which are his statements recorded in FIR No. 313/94 reveal that Ms. B.S. was made hostile to her family and was being influenced by the appellant. In all these letters/documents, not only had he taken an objection of his daughter who was much younger, having unacceptable friendship with the appellant but has  also stated that the appellant has mislead her and even proposed to marry Ms. B.S.  However, in his cross-examination, he tried to back track by asserting that all those complaints were made due to misunderstanding.
28. All these complaints which are contemporary to the incidents happening, have been written from 04.03.1994 onwards.  It is quite apparent that subsequently, the appellant was able to prevail upon not only Ms. B.S. but also on her father who were examined as RPW-1 as the witness of the appellant and CW-1 as the witness by the Court, on 31.08.1998. 
29.  The very fact that the complaints are all admitted by CW1, Mr. N.C.S,  clearly corroborate the averments of the respondent about the appellant having developed affection with Ms. B.S. outside his marriage with the respondent.  The appellant may have been able to win over the father of Ms. B.S. during the pendency of the divorce proceedings, but the claim of the respondent of appellant having developed relationship outside the marriage is fully corroborated and supported not only by the oral testimony, but also by the documents.  
30. The overwhelming evidence on record reflects that indeed the appellant who got involved with Ms. B.S. since 1994 and left the house in August, 1994 was the one who had committed the cruelty upon the respondent.  The respondent wife cannot be penalized for making such allegations and protesting about the relationship which have a strong basis and foundation.  In fact, she had a justification to complain about the conduct of the appellant and to take any view otherwise would indeed be committing cruelty upon the respondent.
31. It becomes apposite to mention that an FIR No.313/1992 under Section 498A/406 IPC had been registered against the appellant, his sister and brother-in-law and while the sister and brother-in-law were discharged at the time of framing of charges, the appellant has been subsequently acquitted vide judgment dated 03.05.2013. However, considering the overwhelming evidence revealing the relationship with Ms. B.S., this  acquittal subsequent to the divorce itself, cannot be a ground to say in the peculiar facts of this case, that any kind of cruelty had been committed upon him by the respondent.  Merely because there is an acquittal by a Criminal Court, does not wash away the cruelty committed by the appellant of being involved with a young girl during the subsistence of his marriage with the respondent; mere acquittal in a criminal case cannot be a ground to grant divorce.
32. We, in the light of blatant conduct of the appellant is showing scant regard to his matrimonial relationship, are compelled to observe that despite it being a failed marriage of over 40 years, granting Divorce would be adding a premium to the wrong acts of the appellant. While the human emotions  know no bounds and rules, but definitely the human sensibilities emanating from the mind should have prevailed for an educated person like the appellant to have reigned his affections for a third person, with scant regard for the respondent who had reposed complete faith by entering into the vows of marriage with him.  This is one case where S.23(1)(a) of the HMA, 1955, which provides that no person can take advantage of its own wrong, comes into play, in full force. 
33. We hereby conclude that the learned Additional District Judge has rightly concluded that it is the appellant who is responsible for acts of cruelty towards the respondent and had rejected the divorce petition.
34. Accordingly, there is no merit in the present Appeal, which is hereby dismissed along with pending application(s), if any.

J U D G M E N T   
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.  
1. The present appeal  under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 
has been preferred by the appellant against the Judgment dated 15.03.2017 , 
passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Delhi vide which the divorce 
Petition bearing HMA No. 61511/2016/04 under Section 13(1) ( ia) of the 
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955  (hereinafter referred to as the “Act, 1955”) , filed 
by the appellant/husband, has been dismissed.  
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married, according to Hindu Customs 
and Rites on 15.03.1983, when the appellant was 24 years and the 
respondent was 20 years of age. They resi ded as husband and wife at 
Kutopur,  Rewari (Haryana)  and from their wedlock, three sons were born on  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 2 of 19 
 07.06.1984, 16.07.1985 and 17.03.1987 , respectively . 
3. The case of the appellant is that  he treated his wife with love and 
affection and provided her with all the comforts of life  but within 2 to 3 
months  of the marriage, the appellant discovered that she had indifferent 
habits , was of a temperamental nature  and would get instigated on petty 
matters  at the instance of her parents, who caused unnecessary interference 
in their marri ed life. She insulted, abused and misbehaved with him and his 
parents, in the presence of relatives, friends and neighbours , despit e the fact 
that he always treated her with great affection . He took care o f her during 
the three pregnancies  and made all efforts to persuade the respondent to live 
as a devote d wife, but all his efforts went in vain. The respondent used to 
extort money fr om him at the behest of her parents and when he did not 
fulfil her demands , she  lodge d false complaints against him , based on 
concocted facts , only to harass him and to compel him to accede to her 
motivated demands.  
4. The appellant had asserted that they ha d a simple marriage, after 
which they started residing in his native village home  in Kutopur, Rewari 
(Haryana)  till 1986. The respondent had no interest in resi ding in the village 
and upon her  insistence, the appellant  shifted to her parents ’ hous e at Naga l 
Raya, Delhi Cantt. along with their  entire belongings.  
5. Admittedly, the father of the respondent had been living separately 
from his wife, since prior to the marriage of the appellant with respondent . 
He had been residing with the two younger brothers of the respondent , at 
Delhi Cantt. Sagarpur , while the mother of the respondent  was residing   
with her elder brother, at Kalu Sarai Begum Pur, Near LIT., New Delhi . The 
appellant had asserted that because of the pressure tactics of the respondent,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 3 of 19 
 he was co mpelled to remain at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., in the parental 
home of the respondent, till 1988.  
6. According to the appellant, he continued to bear the entire household 
expenses, despite which the respondent misbehaved and manhandled  the 
appellant and made his life a hell.  
7. The appellant further asserted that the respondent had no interest in 
his relatives and had refused to attend the marriage of his younger brother , at 
the native village.  Piqued  by the insistence  of the appellant, the respondent 
left the ho use at Nagal Raya and went to live with her mother at Begum Pur, 
Delhi, without  giving  any information  and without the knowledge of the 
appellant. She even made a false complaint against him , at his village 
address.  
8. The appellant has asserted that on retu rning from his native village 
after attending his brother’s marriage, he shifted to rented accommodation at 
Chirag Delhi, in the year 1988, where he stayed for about one and a half 
years  till 1990 . It was only after great persuasion that the respondent joi ned 
his company , even though an inquiry was conducted against him on the 
complaint that had been filed  by her . However, the complaint was eventually 
closed.  
9. The appellant had further disclosed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat 
of DDA was booked by his fat her which was allotted to him and the 
possession was delivered in the year 1990. The appellant shifted with the 
respondent to the said flat but on the instigation of her family, he was forced 
to sell the flat and buy two plots of land measuring 100 square yards and 50 
square yards, in Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai , Delhi . 
10. The appellant has further asserted that while he was residing in Chirag  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 4 of 19 
 Delhi, the mother of the respondent was constructing her house and the 
appellant was compelled to contribute Rs.15,000/ -, in order to maintain 
cordial relationship  with the respondent as the mother -in-law was not 
financially sound. However, despite doing all this, the respondent and her 
mother, without any prior information, took their belongings from the rented 
house and s hifted to the house of the mother. Even thereafter, t he appellant 
along with the respondent resided in the mother’s house for about two 
months  till March 1991 . 
11. He further asserted that from time to time, he was compelled t o give 
money to the brother of the  respondent and her family. On 02.04.1996 , he 
was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/ - to Kanh aya Lal, brother of the 
respondent, on the occasion of his marriage . He also transferred Rs.30,000/ - 
in the account of her elder brother, Som  Dutt alias Gopal, to help hi m in 
meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his 
plot of land.  He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/ - to Kanhaya Lal, 
to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the 
respondent. In the year 2000, h e was also asked to pay  Rs.50,000/ - to Sona 
Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of 
the engagement of her daughter  but when t he appellant refused to give 
money , it infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, wh en the 
appellant returned from G uwahati , he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/ -, at the 
time of the marriage of another  daughter . Even though he again refused  to 
give the money, he was illegally detained when he came to Delhi on 
29.07.2001 and was forced to give  a sum of Rs.1,00,000/ - through cheque , 
to the respondent .  
12. The appellant  has further submitted that he was transferred to  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 5 of 19 
 Guwahati  in August, 1988, where he resided till March 2001.  Meanwhile, 
the appellant came to Delhi in March , 2000, for a few days but  was shocked  
to learn that the respondent was having contact and relations with one 
Mahesh Kumar, who had earlier assaulted the appellant and against whom, 
the FIR had been registered . Upon being confronted, the respondent  
extended threats to the appellant  that he would face serious consequences.  
13. The appellant had further asserted that the respondent had pressurised 
him to transfer the house/plot measuring 50 square yards , with a structure 
thereon , in the name of the respondent and when he refused, she thr eatened 
him with implication in false case and also made a false complaint 
containing baseless and fabr icated allegations against him, his parents and 
other relatives in Crime against Women Cell , Nanakpura , Delhi , though, it 
was subsequently consigned to t he Record Room .  
14. On 18.10.2001, Padam Singh , the brother of the respondent along 
with his associate s, entered the house of the appellant and physically 
assaulted him and damaged the property , since he was not willing to yield to 
the uncalled demands and dictates  of the respondent.  It is asserted that 
because of such cruelties  committed upon him by the respondent and her 
family members, he became completely depressed and tried to commit 
suicide by consuming poison  and was taken to Safdarjung Hospital, where 
he was admitted.  
15. It is further asserted that the appellant continued to discharge his 
obligations and paid substantial amount of his salary to the respondent , for 
the expenses of the household and also paid various household items. He 
paid various amounts  to the respondent regularly , since December, 2003 and 
aside from such regular payments, he deposited Rs.50,000/ - by way of Fixed  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 6 of 19 
 Deposit, in her name. He even earlier had being depositing cash in her 
account in the year 2001. He even purchased the LIC pol ices, in the name of 
the respondent and their sons for Rs.1,00,000/ - each, for which he has been 
regularly paying the premium . The appellant paid the entire salary to the 
respondent but requested her to give him Rs.200/ - for the pocket expenses 
but she cre ated a scene and abused and manhandled the appellant and lodged 
a false complaint in Police Post Maidan garhi, Police Station;  Mehrauli. The 
appellant was detained in the Police Post for the whole night and was let off 
in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. 
On 24.03.20 04, when he returned from the Police Post , the respondent left 
him.  
16. According to the appellant, in May 2004, on two to three occasion, a n 
attempt was made by the respondent , to force him to accompany her to  a 
nearb y jungle but the appellant fearing from foul play desisted from going 
with her, which antagonised  the respondent. On 29.05.2004, a nother attempt 
to murder and kidnap him was made by her along with the brothers, namely, 
Padam Singh and Kanhiya Lal , which again caused immense mental cruelty, 
tension and agony to him.  
17. He asserted that he had been treated with utmost physical and mental 
cruelty for the last 20 years. She even lodged a false complaint in CAW 
Cell, New Delhi and made b aseless allegations  against him. He filed his 
detailed reply and endeavour was also made by the respondent to get him 
thrown out of his house, which he had built with his heart and all the money.  
The respon dent also made complaints in his  Department to the superior 
officers  and colleagues only with an intention to defame him.        
18. The appellant , thus sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.   
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 7 of 19 
 19. The petition was contested by the respondent , who denied all the 
allegations made against her by the appellant. The respondent had cla imed 
in her Written S tatement that the entire case of the appellant, was based on 
false allegations. She denied that she ever treated the appellant with cruelty 
and asserted that  it was  she, who has been deserted by the appellant , on 
03.05.2004. She claime d that the divorce petition was liable to be dismissed.  
20. The issues from the pleadings, were framed on 19.12.2007 , as 
under: - 
“(i)  Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner 
with cruelty, as alleged, after the solemnization of 
the marriage OPP  
 
(ii) Relief. ” 
 
21. The appellant  appeared as PW-1. He also examined PW -2, Ms. 
Meena Kumari, Record Keeper from Delhi Commission for Women, Vikas 
Bhawan, ITO, Delhi , CAW Cell, to prove the complaints dated 27.07.2001, 
02.04.2004 and the Letter dated 08.08.2001, pu rportedly written by the 
Delhi Legislator, forwarding the complaints to the DCW for enquiries. PW-
3 Sh. Sukesh Kumar, H.G.A.  from LIC of India, produced the records of the 
LIC Policies, taken for the benefit of the children, in the name of the 
respondent.  PW-4, Sh. Ajaib Singh, Engineer Asstt. to S.S.W. (Civil I) 
CCW All India Radio , produced the nomination form, submitted by the 
appellant, with the Department. PW-5 Sh. Raj Kumar Barwal, Deputy 
Manager, PNB IGNOU Branch , produced the statement of account of  the 
appellant.  
22. The respondent appeared as RW -1 and examined her son as RW-2,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 8 of 19 
 Sh. Kulbhushan Kumar . 
23. The learned Principal Judge, Family Courts,  on the basis of the 
entire evidence, concluded that the appellant was unable to discharge the 
burden to prove t hat he had been subjected to such form of cruelty that gave 
a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or 
detrimental  for him to reside with the respondent.  It was observed  that in the 
first seven years of their marriage, they were bles sed with three sons and 
there  was no evidence whatsoever to show how the appellant was being 
subjected to cruelty by the respondent. There was no cogent evidence to 
prove that the respondent had failed to discharge her duties as a wife or as a 
mother. Bald allegations were made by the appellant, which were found to 
be not substantiated by any cogent evidence. The averments of the appellant 
that she used to make sarcastic remarks and called him ‘chasmuddin ‟, 
„andha ‟ (blind)  and „githu ‟, were also found to be  of no consequence. It was 
observed  that such allegations were for the first time made in the                    
cross -examination by the appellant.  
24. It was further observed that there was no cogent evidence of the 
money having been given to the mother -in-law or the brother -in-law.  
25. The complaint dated 15.02.1998 Ex -PW-2/D lodged by the 
respondent with DCP Women Cell, Delhi, wherein the respondent had 
alleged that the appellant had tried to kill her and her three children by 
pouring kerosene, was held to be  not proved. Likewise , the second 
complaint dated 27.10.2001, made in DCW and the third complaint dated 
02.04.2004 in DCW, Delhi, were found to have not been pursued and 
closed.  
26. It was also held that the story of attempted suicide by the appellant on  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 9 of 19 
 25.10.2001, cannot be attributed to any act or omission of the respondent.  
Ld. Judge, Family Court thus,  concluded  that the appellant had failed to 
prove that the respondent had committed any kind of cruelty and the petition 
for divorce was dismissed.  
27. Aggrie ved, the appellant/husband has preferred the present Appeal.   
28. Submissions heard  and the record perused.  
29. The first aspect which emerges from the testimony of the parties, is 
that the appellant, who was  a Civil Engineer  in the Government service , had 
been pr oviding for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, 
throughout the period , that they were together.  
30. Pertinently, the respondent had filed an affidavit of evidence, where 
she had merely claimed that the appellant had not paid anything to m aintain 
the family and miserably neglected to perform his duties as husband and a 
disciplined father and that the future of the three sons got spoiled because of 
the negligence of the appellant. The respondent  has however, admitted in her 
cross -examination  that the appellant provided money for their livelihood, 
though she claimed that it was only a minimum amount to meet their daily 
expenses. She has further admitted that the appellant used to give money for 
her personal expenses, though again , she tried to  qualify by saying that he 
used to take back the money. She also admitted that he had taken LIC 
Policies in her name  as well a s their children, for which he was paying the 
instalments and also admitted that she had received Rs.40,000/ -, for the two 
LIC Pol icies. All her admissions , show that the appellant had been a caring 
husband and had provided for all the requirements of the respondent and the 
children, as per his means.  
31. It is further not in dispute that,  for the first three years of the marriage,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 10 of 19 
 1983  till 1986, the parties resided at the parental home of the appellant in 
Rewari .  The appellant has explained that since his job was in Delhi, he was 
commuting on the regular basis  to his place of work.  According to the 
appellant, the respondent wanted to reside in Delhi and had no interest to 
reside in a village and because of her constant insistence, they shifted to her 
parents’ house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt. , where the father  was residing 
along with his two sons i.e. the brothers of the respondent. Th e mother, 
however, had been living separately with the third brother of the respondent 
at Kalu Sarai Begampur, New Delhi . There is no challenge that the parties 
resided at Nagal Raya, till 1988.  
32. The appellant had asserted that in the year 1988, he had gon e to attend 
the wedding of his younger brother at the native village, to which the 
respondent refused to accompany. However, on his return, he was shocked 
to find that  without informing him,  the respondent had shifted to her 
mother’s house at Begumpur, Del hi.  
33. She also filed a false complaint against him at the native village 
address. Pertinently, the respondent has deposed nothing about this incident 
in her affidavit of evidence but has admitted in her cross -examination that 
she had a quarrel with the appe llant and that he had beaten her with the fry 
pan and that she suffered injury on her teeth. However, she admits that she 
did not file any complaint to the Police , in regard to this incident. Though 
the respondent claimed to have been beaten up by the appe llant but aside 
from her b ald claims in her cross -examination, there is no other evidence of 
mal-treatment by the appellant, on record.  
34. The respondent in her cross -examination , admitted having made a 
complaint Ex -PW-2/D, to DCP Women Cell, Delhi, in the y ear 1988.  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 11 of 19 
 Significantly, she narrates nothing in her testimony about the alleged cruelty 
which compelled her to make this complaint , but the perusal of the 
complaint shows that she made serious allegations  of the appellant 
attempting to kill her and the th ree son s by pouring kerosene on them. There 
is no evidence that any follow -up action got taken on the said complaint. 
Though serious allegations have been made against the appellant but the 
same have not only been denied by the appellant but also not prove d by the 
respondent.   
35. Though the parties continued to reside together despite their 
differences , but the respondent admittedly made another complaint dated 
27.07.2001, which is exhibited as Ex -PW2/A , wherein she made allegations 
of illicit relationship of the appellant  with some woman  while he was posted 
in Assam. She  volunteered in her cross -examination  that t hese facts were 
disclosed to her by the appellant himself  who stated that earlier the woman 
was in volved with h is boss Mr. D.K. Mishra, but thereaft er, he had passed 
her on to the appellant.   
36. The backdrop of this allegation is that undisputedly,  the appellant was 
a Central Government employee working with the Ministry of Information 
& Broadcasting as a Civil Engineer  and had remained at  Guwahati , from  
1988 to 2001 . The respondent in her cross -examination , claimed that she had 
made the said complaint because the appellant had beaten her seriously . 
From the admissions of the respondent herself, it is evident that she had no 
basis for making such allegati ons but she has been consistent in levelling 
such allegations against the appellant, without any basis. Even in her 
complaint to the police, she had been persistent in making these allegations.  
37. In addition to being beaten up by stick and danda  out of the house at  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 12 of 19 
 gali and mohalla,  with threats to kill her , she even made allegation that the 
appellant with the support of Laxmi Narain Sagar, his mamaji and 
Dharamvati Sagar, mamiji , conspired to kill her. She went on to state that 
many a times, he left the gas  cylinder open in the kitchen while he himself 
came out , with an intent  to burn her. So much so, he did not sleep in the 
house but forced her to sleep, which gave rise to an apprehension in her 
mind that he wanted to kill her , in her sleep. She even made a llegations 
against the Mama and Mami of the appellant by asserting that they used to 
claim about the ir daughter and son -in-law being lawyers and  their in -laws 
being Magistrate and that whatever she may do, she would be thrown on the 
fork of the road.  All these allegations made in the complaint, have not been 
even mentioned by her, in her Written Statement or in her testimony. She 
has also miserably failed to prove the truth of any of these serious 
allegations made against the appellant.  
38. The matter did not end here because she made a third complaint dated 
02.04.20 04, Ex -PW-2/B, to Delhi Commission for Women, Delhi, alleging 
that while the appellant was in Guwahati, one con tractor , Sh. Damodar 
Aggarwal and some people residing in Assam, together started black mailing 
her and she wrote to the Department to transfer him back to Delhi. However, 
her husband started fighting with her regularly and ha d been telling her that 
the colony where they were residing, was not good and that they would sell 
the house and shift  to some other area. On 24th March,  2004  he in the middle 
of the night, demanded the documents of the property and started breaking 
the lock of the almirah with the  hammer and when she tried to prevent the 
appellant, he tried to hit her with the hammer on her head but was prevented 
by their elder son. He even tried to strangulate her but she was able to  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 13 of 19 
 escape and g et out of the house. She then called the Police at Number 100 
and the police arrived and they were taken to police post Maidangarhi . 
While she a nd her son w ere sent back , the appellant was detained in the 
Police Post . She felt that she had not got any justice and therefore, made the 
complaint.  
39.  Significantly, here also not only has she made allegations of physical 
beatings by the appellant but als o of his greed for the property documents . 
But again, in her affidavit of evidence, not a word has been spoken by her. 
While the appellant had deposed about this complaint in his testimony , but 
pertinently , there is no cogent cross -examination done on this  complaint by 
the respondent. In her own testimony as well, she has not explained any of 
the allegations that have been made in the said complaint.  
40. It is more than evident from the evidence on record that the 
respondent has been making irresponsible compl aints not only of being 
subjected to physical cruelty by the appellant but even of illicit relationship 
of the appellant , with some woman.  
41. In the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita  X (2014) SLT 126. the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false c omplaint against the 
husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the 
purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act.   
42. Along si milar lines, the Supreme Court in the case of  Ravi Kumar vs. 
Julmidevi  (2010) 4 SCC 476 has categ orically held that  “reckless, false and 
defamatory allegations against the husband and family members would have 
an effect of lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society and it 
amounts to cruelty.”  Similar observations were made by the  Coordinate 
Bench of this Court in the case of Rita vs. Jai Solanki  (2017)  SCC OnLine  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 14 of 19 
 Del 9078 and Nishi vs. Jagdish Ram  233 (2016) DLT 50.  
43. Thus, m aking of such false complaints can be termed as nothing but 
acts of mental cruelty.  
44. The persistent conduct of the respond ent has been repressive and 
oppressive towards the appellant, who in order to make the ir marriage work , 
had tolerated this behaviour for no less than 20 years. He made every 
endeavour to be able to cope with the cir cumstances ; to make the marriage 
work but  this long cruel conduct of the respondent, became unbearable for 
him when he admittedly attempted suicide on 25.10.2001 , by consuming 
poison. The respondent has also admitted that the appellant was taken to  
Safdarjung hospital , where he remain admitted.  
45. Independently, the individual incidents may seem to be innocuous and 
make it termed as a normal wear and tear  but when considered 
whol istically , it is evident  that such conduct created such pressure on the 
appellant  that eventually, he felt so co rnered an d unable to escape from this 
situation , that he even a ttempted  suicide. There could not have been a more 
blatant manifestation of his inability to sustain himself in such repressive 
and toxic environment  which was being suffered by the appellant . Such is 
the conduct of the respondent that no  person can reasonably be expected to 
put up with such conduct and to continue to live with the other party , as has 
been held in the Case of Veer Bhagat vs. Dheer Bhagat  (1994) 1 SCC 337.   
46. It is evident that the pervasi ve, blatant and latent conduct of the 
respondent , has had an injurious impact on the life of the appellant and 
caused trauma and mental agony to the mind of the appellant , entitling him 
to Divorce,  as has been held in the Case of Shobha Rani vs. Madhukar 
Reddy (1988) 1 SCC 105.         
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 15 of 19 
 47. The appellant had also deposed that he , from time to time, was 
compelled by the respondent , to give money to his brothers and mother. He 
had deposed that on 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/ - to 
Kanh aya Lal, broth er of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He 
also transferred Rs.30,000/ - in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt 
alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction 
that he was doing on his plot of land. He was c ompelled to give a sum of 
Rs.12,000/ - to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at 
Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also 
asked to pay Rs.50,000/ - to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother 
of the responde nt, at the time of the engagement of her daughter. The 
appellant refused to give money, which infuriated the respondent. Likewise, 
in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from G uwahati , he was forced 
to pay Rs.50,000/ -, at the time of the marriage of  another daughter, though 
he again refused. When the appellant came to Delhi on 29.07.2001, he was 
illegally detained and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/ -, through 
cheque.  
48. Another significant aspect which needs mention is that it is not 
disputed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat being No. 263, Pocket -3, 
Madhipur, New Delhi, was booked by the father of the appellant in his  
name, which was eventually allotted and possession  handed -over in the year 
1990 . The appellant along with the respondent, shi fted to the said flat but 
because of the respondent had been influenced by her mother and family 
members, did not stay in the flat and forced the appellant to sell the flat , to 
purchase the plot near her mother’s house. The appellant eventually sold the 
flat in the year 1992 and two adjoining plots measuring 100 square yards  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 16 of 19 
 and 50 square yards respectively , were purchased by the respondent , which 
were at a distance of about five kilometres , from the parental home of the 
respondent . The location and the cir cumstances as deposed by the appellant , 
reinforce his testimony of he being compelled to sell the flat , to be nearer to 
the parental home of the respondent.  
49. The appellant had deposed that he raised construction on the plot  and 
shifted there in the year 19 92. The appellant had further deposed that in the 
year 1997, the respondent insisted that the house constructed on 100 square 
yards plot , be transferred in her name. When the appellant refused, he was 
threatened with false implication in criminal case by leaving a note 
implicating him by blaming him for her committing suicide.  
50.  The respondent significantly has admitted that a portion of the 
property bearing No. C -46, Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, near IGNOU , Delhi, 
was transferred in her name. She tried to giv e an explanation that the 
appellant had done the same to save income -tax and denied the suggestion 
that the appellant transferred the said property in her name on her threat of 
false implication in a criminal case . The admissions of the respondent in her 
cross-examination further reinforce s the testimony of the appellant that he 
had been compelled to transfer a portion of his property , in the name of the 
respondent.  
51. In the circumstances, one can only appreciate  the resilience and the 
tenacity  of the appell ant who continue d to endeavour to live in this 
matrimonial relationship though he was subjected to such anguish and 
mental cruelty on a regular basis because of the conduct of the respondent.  
52. The parties have separated in the year 2004 ; the appellant has 
explained that the respondent left the matrimonial home in March, 2004  but  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 17 of 19 
 she came back in May, 2004 and threw out the appellant from his own 
house. To the contrary, t he respondent has asserted that the appellant himself 
left the matrimonial home in May , 2004. While she has asserted  so, she has 
failed to give any explanation s of the circumstances of separation in the year 
2004 , either in her affidavit of evidence or by way of suggestion to the 
appellant, in the cross -examination. On the other hand , the appe llant has 
been categorical in stating that the respondent herself left the matrimonial 
home in March, 2004  after she had filed a false complaint against him in 
Police Station , Mehrauli  in which he  was detained by the police for the 
whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on 
two to three blank  papers . There is not a whisper of word on behalf of the 
respondent , to explain the circumstances of separation.  
53. Her testimony has been conspicuous by silence in explaining if she 
ever made any endeavour  or effort to join back the company of the 
appellant.  On the other hand, the appellant has explained the conduct of the 
respondent over a period of about twenty years , which had made it 
extremely  oppressive for him to continue in the matrimonial  relationship.  
The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is the respondent, who has 
not been able to explain the circumstances as to why the appellant  left the 
house. Rather, the evidence and the admissions of the respondent establish 
that t he appellant has always discharged his matrimonial obligations towards 
the respondent and her family.  Such deprivation  of conjugal relationship by 
the respondent since the year 2004 , with no effort of re -conciliation , is the 
ultimate act of rejection of th e matrimonial relationship amounting to the 
extreme cruelty  to which a man can be subjected , warranting dissolution of 
the marriage , as held by the Apex Court in the case of Samar Ghogh v. Jaya  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 18 of 19 
 Ghosh  (2007) 4 SCC 511.  
54. In the recent case of Rakesh Raman vs.  Kavita , 2023 SCC OnLine SC 
497, it was observed that long separation and absence of cohabitation along 
with the complete breakdown of meaningful bonds of matrimony, has to be 
read as cruelty. It was further observed that the continuation of such a 
marriag e would only mean giving a sanction of cruelty which the respondent 
has been inflicting on the appellant.   
55.   From the aforesaid discussion, it  may be concluded that the 
respondent since the day of the marriage, had initially a problem of settling 
in the vi llage . Subsequently, on shifting to Delhi, she under the influence of 
her mother and family members, compelled the appellant  from time to time , 
to give money to her and the family members. It has also emerged that the 
appellant  had been prevailed to sell h is flat to buy property, clos er to the 
house of the respondent’s parents. Such was the influence of the family of 
the respondent on her that she essentially was dicta ted in her conduct by the 
family members. She went to the extent of lodging three complain ts in a 
span of 20 years , against the appellant  but has not been able to prove even 
an iota of truth in her complaints. Despite such adversity, the appellant had 
admittedly all throughout discharge d his obligations as a husband and a 
father and had provide d for  all the financial and other needs of the 
respondent  and his sons and had supported  them all thr ough  out. In these 
circumstances, it has to be concluded that the appellant made all endeavours, 
which lasted for 20 years to bring in matrimonial harmony and peace , but 
failed miserably.  
56. In view of above, we are of the considered opinion that the  acts of 
respondent can only be termed as acts of cruelty entitling the appellant to a  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 19 of 19 
 decree of divorce , on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) ( ia) of the  
Hindu Marriage Act.   
57. We hereby set aside the impugned judgment dated  15.03.2017 . The 
Appeal is hereby allowed and the divorce on the ground of cruelty under 
Section 13 (1) ( ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act , is granted . 
58. The decree sheet be prepared accordingl y.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA

     J U D G M E N T  
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
1. The present appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 has been preferred by the appellant against the Judgment dated 15.03.2017, passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Delhi vide which the divorce Petition bearing HMA No. 61511/2016/04 under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 1955), filed by the appellant/husband, has been dismissed. 
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married, according to Hindu Customs and Rites on 15.03.1983, when the appellant was 24 years and the respondent was 20 years of age. They resided as husband and wife at Kutopur, Rewari (Haryana) and from their wedlock, three sons were born on 07.06.1984, 16.07.1985 and 17.03.1987, respectively.
3. The case of the appellant is that he treated his wife with love and affection and provided her with all the comforts of life but within 2 to 3 months of the marriage, the appellant discovered that she had indifferent habits, was of a temperamental nature and would get instigated on petty matters at the instance of her parents, who caused unnecessary interference in their married life. She insulted, abused and misbehaved with him and his parents, in the presence of relatives, friends and neighbours, despite the fact that he always treated her with great affection. He took care of her during the three pregnancies and made all efforts to persuade the respondent to live as a devoted wife, but all his efforts went in vain. The respondent used to extort money from him at the behest of her parents and when he did not fulfil her demands, she lodged false complaints against him, based on concocted facts, only to harass him and to compel him to accede to her motivated demands. 
4. The appellant had asserted that they had a simple marriage, after which they started residing in his native village home in Kutopur, Rewari (Haryana) till 1986. The respondent had no interest in residing in the village and upon her insistence, the appellant shifted to her parents house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt. along with their entire belongings. 
5. Admittedly, the father of the respondent had been living separately from his wife, since prior to the marriage of the appellant with respondent. He had been residing with the two younger brothers of the respondent, at Delhi Cantt. Sagarpur, while the mother of the respondent was residing   with her elder brother, at Kalu Sarai Begum Pur, Near LIT., New Delhi. The appellant had asserted that because of the pressure tactics of the respondent, he was compelled to remain at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., in the parental home of the respondent, till 1988.
6. According to the appellant, he continued to bear the entire household expenses, despite which the respondent misbehaved and manhandled the appellant and made his life a hell.
7. The appellant further asserted that the respondent had no interest in his relatives and had refused to attend the marriage of his younger brother, at the native village. Piqued by the insistence of the appellant, the respondent left the house at Nagal Raya and went to live with her mother at Begum Pur, Delhi, without giving any information and without the knowledge of the appellant. She even made a false complaint against him, at his village address. 
8. The appellant has asserted that on returning from his native village after attending his brothers marriage, he shifted to rented accommodation at Chirag Delhi, in the year 1988, where he stayed for about one and a half years till 1990. It was only after great persuasion that the respondent joined his company, even though an inquiry was conducted against him on the complaint that had been filed by her. However, the complaint was eventually closed. 
9. The appellant had further disclosed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat of DDA was booked by his father which was allotted to him and the possession was delivered in the year 1990. The appellant shifted with the respondent to the said flat but on the instigation of her family, he was forced to sell the flat and buy two plots of land measuring 100 square yards and 50 square yards, in Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, Delhi.
10. The appellant has further asserted that while he was residing in Chirag Delhi, the mother of the respondent was constructing her house and the appellant was compelled to contribute Rs.15,000/-, in order to maintain cordial relationship with the respondent as the mother-in-law was not financially sound. However, despite doing all this, the respondent and her mother, without any prior information, took their belongings from the rented house and shifted to the house of the mother. Even thereafter, the appellant along with the respondent resided in the mothers house for about two months till March 1991.
11. He further asserted that from time to time, he was compelled to give money to the brother of the respondent and her family. On 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, brother of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He also transferred Rs.30,000/- in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his plot of land. He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also asked to pay Rs.50,000/- to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of the engagement of her daughter but when the appellant refused to give money, it infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from Guwahati, he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/-, at the time of the marriage of another daughter. Even though he again refused to give the money, he was illegally detained when he came to Delhi on 29.07.2001 and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- through cheque, to the respondent. 
12. The appellant has further submitted that he was transferred to Guwahati in August, 1988, where he resided till March 2001. Meanwhile, the appellant came to Delhi in March, 2000, for a few days but was shocked to learn that the respondent was having contact and relations with one Mahesh Kumar, who had earlier assaulted the appellant and against whom, the FIR had been registered. Upon being confronted, the respondent extended threats to the appellant that he would face serious consequences. 
13. The appellant had further asserted that the respondent had pressurised him to transfer the house/plot measuring 50 square yards, with a structure thereon, in the name of the respondent and when he refused, she threatened him with implication in false case and also made a false complaint containing baseless and fabricated allegations against him, his parents and other relatives in Crime against Women Cell, Nanakpura, Delhi, though, it was subsequently consigned to the Record Room. 
14. On 18.10.2001, Padam Singh, the brother of the respondent along with his associates, entered the house of the appellant and physically assaulted him and damaged the property, since he was not willing to yield to the uncalled demands and dictates of the respondent. It is asserted that because of such cruelties committed upon him by the respondent and her family members, he became completely depressed and tried to commit suicide by consuming poison and was taken to Safdarjung Hospital, where he was admitted. 
15. It is further asserted that the appellant continued to discharge his obligations and paid substantial amount of his salary to the respondent, for the expenses of the household and also paid various household items. He paid various amounts to the respondent regularly, since December, 2003 and aside from such regular payments, he deposited Rs.50,000/- by way of Fixed Deposit, in her name. He even earlier had being depositing cash in her account in the year 2001. He even purchased the LIC polices, in the name of the respondent and their sons for Rs.1,00,000/- each, for which he has been regularly paying the premium. The appellant paid the entire salary to the respondent but requested her to give him Rs.200/- for the pocket expenses but she created a scene and abused and manhandled the appellant and lodged a false complaint in Police Post Maidangarhi, Police Station; Mehrauli. The appellant was detained in the Police Post for the whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. On 24.03.2004, when he returned from the Police Post, the respondent left him. 
16. According to the appellant, in May 2004, on two to three occasion, an attempt was made by the respondent, to force him to accompany her to a nearby jungle but the appellant fearing from foul play desisted from going with her, which antagonised the respondent. On 29.05.2004, another attempt to murder and kidnap him was made by her along with the brothers, namely, Padam Singh and Kanhiya Lal, which again caused immense mental cruelty, tension and agony to him. 
17. He asserted that he had been treated with utmost physical and mental cruelty for the last 20 years. She even lodged a false complaint in CAW Cell, New Delhi and made baseless allegations against him. He filed his detailed reply and endeavour was also made by the respondent to get him thrown out of his house, which he had built with his heart and all the money. The respondent also made complaints in his Department to the superior officers and colleagues only with an intention to defame him.       
18. The appellant, thus sought divorce on the ground of cruelty. 
19. The petition was contested by the respondent, who denied all the allegations made against her by the appellant. The respondent had claimed in her Written Statement that the entire case of the appellant, was based on false allegations. She denied that she ever treated the appellant with cruelty and asserted that it was she, who has been deserted by the appellant, on 03.05.2004. She claimed that the divorce petition was liable to be dismissed. 
20. The issues from the pleadings, were framed on 19.12.2007, as under:-
(i)		Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty, as alleged, after the solemnization of the marriage OPP

(ii)	Relief.

21. The appellant appeared as PW-1. He also examined PW-2, Ms. Meena Kumari, Record Keeper from Delhi Commission for Women, Vikas Bhawan, ITO, Delhi, CAW Cell, to prove the complaints dated 27.07.2001, 02.04.2004 and the Letter dated 08.08.2001, purportedly written by the Delhi Legislator, forwarding the complaints to the DCW for enquiries. PW-3 Sh. Sukesh Kumar, H.G.A. from LIC of India, produced the records of the LIC Policies, taken for the benefit of the children, in the name of the respondent. PW-4, Sh. Ajaib Singh, Engineer Asstt. to S.S.W. (Civil I) CCW All India Radio, produced the nomination form, submitted by the appellant, with the Department. PW-5 Sh. Raj Kumar Barwal, Deputy Manager, PNB IGNOU Branch, produced the statement of account of the appellant. 
22. The respondent appeared as RW-1 and examined her son as RW-2, Sh. Kulbhushan Kumar.
23. The learned Principal Judge, Family Courts, on the basis of the entire evidence, concluded that the appellant was unable to discharge the burden to prove that he had been subjected to such form of cruelty that gave a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or detrimental for him to reside with the respondent. It was observed that in the first seven years of their marriage, they were blessed with three sons and there was no evidence whatsoever to show how the appellant was being subjected to cruelty by the respondent. There was no cogent evidence to prove that the respondent had failed to discharge her duties as a wife or as a mother. Bald allegations were made by the appellant, which were found to be not substantiated by any cogent evidence. The averments of the appellant that she used to make sarcastic remarks and called him chasmuddin, andha (blind) and githu, were also found to be of no consequence. It was observed that such allegations were for the first time made in the                    cross-examination by the appellant. 
24. It was further observed that there was no cogent evidence of the money having been given to the mother-in-law or the brother-in-law. 
25. The complaint dated 15.02.1998 Ex-PW-2/D lodged by the respondent with DCP Women Cell, Delhi, wherein the respondent had alleged that the appellant had tried to kill her and her three children by pouring kerosene, was held to be not proved. Likewise, the second complaint dated 27.10.2001, made in DCW and the third complaint dated 02.04.2004 in DCW, Delhi, were found to have not been pursued and closed. 
26. It was also held that the story of attempted suicide by the appellant on 25.10.2001, cannot be attributed to any act or omission of the respondent. Ld. Judge, Family Court thus, concluded  that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent had committed any kind of cruelty and the petition for divorce was dismissed. 
27. Aggrieved, the appellant/husband has preferred the present Appeal. 
28. Submissions heard and the record perused.
29. The first aspect which emerges from the testimony of the parties, is that the appellant, who was a Civil Engineer in the Government service, had been providing for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, throughout the period, that they were together. 
30. Pertinently, the respondent had filed an affidavit of evidence, where she had merely claimed that the appellant had not paid anything to maintain the family and miserably neglected to perform his duties as husband and a disciplined father and that the future of the three sons got spoiled because of the negligence of the appellant. The respondent has however, admitted in her cross-examination that the appellant provided money for their livelihood, though she claimed that it was only a minimum amount to meet their daily expenses. She has further admitted that the appellant used to give money for her personal expenses, though again, she tried to qualify by saying that he used to take back the money. She also admitted that he had taken LIC Policies in her name as well as their children, for which he was paying the instalments and also admitted that she had received Rs.40,000/-, for the two LIC Policies. All her admissions, show that the appellant had been a caring husband and had provided for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, as per his means. 
31. It is further not in dispute that, for the first three years of the marriage, 1983 till 1986, the parties resided at the parental home of the appellant in Rewari.  The appellant has explained that since his job was in Delhi, he was commuting on the regular basis to his place of work. According to the appellant, the respondent wanted to reside in Delhi and had no interest to reside in a village and because of her constant insistence, they shifted to her parents house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., where the father was residing along with his two sons i.e. the brothers of the respondent. The mother, however, had been living separately with the third brother of the respondent at Kalu Sarai Begampur, New Delhi. There is no challenge that the parties resided at Nagal Raya, till 1988. 
32. The appellant had asserted that in the year 1988, he had gone to attend the wedding of his younger brother at the native village, to which the respondent refused to accompany. However, on his return, he was shocked to find that without informing him, the respondent had shifted to her mothers house at Begumpur, Delhi. 
33. She also filed a false complaint against him at the native village address. Pertinently, the respondent has deposed nothing about this incident in her affidavit of evidence but has admitted in her cross-examination that she had a quarrel with the appellant and that he had beaten her with the fry pan and that she suffered injury on her teeth. However, she admits that she did not file any complaint to the Police, in regard to this incident. Though the respondent claimed to have been beaten up by the appellant but aside from her bald claims in her cross-examination, there is no other evidence of mal-treatment by the appellant, on record. 
34. The respondent in her cross-examination, admitted having made a complaint Ex-PW-2/D, to DCP Women Cell, Delhi, in the year 1988. Significantly, she narrates nothing in her testimony about the alleged cruelty which compelled her to make this complaint, but the perusal of the complaint shows that she made serious allegations of the appellant attempting to kill her and the three sons by pouring kerosene on them. There is no evidence that any follow-up action got taken on the said complaint. Though serious allegations have been made against the appellant but the same have not only been denied by the appellant but also not proved by the respondent.  
35. Though the parties continued to reside together despite their differences, but the respondent admittedly made another complaint dated 27.07.2001, which is exhibited as Ex-PW2/A, wherein she made allegations of illicit relationship of the appellant with some woman while he was posted in Assam. She volunteered in her cross-examination that these facts were disclosed to her by the appellant himself who stated that earlier the woman was involved with his boss Mr. D.K. Mishra, but thereafter, he had passed her on to the appellant. 
36. The backdrop of this allegation is that undisputedly, the appellant was a Central Government employee working with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting as a Civil Engineer and had remained at Guwahati, from 1988 to 2001. The respondent in her cross-examination, claimed that she had made the said complaint because the appellant had beaten her seriously. From the admissions of the respondent herself, it is evident that she had no basis for making such allegations but she has been consistent in levelling such allegations against the appellant, without any basis. Even in her complaint to the police, she had been persistent in making these allegations. 
37. In addition to being beaten up by stick and danda out of the house at gali and mohalla, with threats to kill her, she even made allegation that the appellant with the support of Laxmi Narain Sagar, his mamaji and Dharamvati Sagar, mamiji, conspired to kill her. She went on to state that many a times, he left the gas cylinder open in the kitchen while he himself came out, with an intent to burn her. So much so, he did not sleep in the house but forced her to sleep, which gave rise to an apprehension in her mind that he wanted to kill her, in her sleep. She even made allegations against the Mama and Mami of the appellant by asserting that they used to claim about their daughter and son-in-law being lawyers and their in-laws being Magistrate and that whatever she may do, she would be thrown on the fork of the road. All these allegations made in the complaint, have not been even mentioned by her, in her Written Statement or in her testimony. She has also miserably failed to prove the truth of any of these serious allegations made against the appellant. 
38. The matter did not end here because she made a third complaint dated 02.04.2004, Ex-PW-2/B, to Delhi Commission for Women, Delhi, alleging that while the appellant was in Guwahati, one contractor, Sh. Damodar Aggarwal and some people residing in Assam, together started blackmailing her and she wrote to the Department to transfer him back to Delhi. However, her husband started fighting with her regularly and had been telling her that the colony where they were residing, was not good and that they would sell the house and shift to some other area. On 24th March, 2004 he in the middle of the night, demanded the documents of the property and started breaking the lock of the almirah with the hammer and when she tried to prevent the appellant, he tried to hit her with the hammer on her head but was prevented by their elder son. He even tried to strangulate her but she was able to escape and get out of the house. She then called the Police at Number 100 and the police arrived and they were taken to police post Maidangarhi. While she and her son were sent back, the appellant was detained in the Police Post. She felt that she had not got any justice and therefore, made the complaint.
39.  Significantly, here also not only has she made allegations of physical beatings by the appellant but also of his greed for the property documents. But again, in her affidavit of evidence, not a word has been spoken by her. While the appellant had deposed about this complaint in his testimony, but pertinently, there is no cogent cross-examination done on this complaint by the respondent. In her own testimony as well, she has not explained any of the allegations that have been made in the said complaint. 
40. It is more than evident from the evidence on record that the respondent has been making irresponsible complaints not only of being subjected to physical cruelty by the appellant but even of illicit relationship of the appellant, with some woman. 
41. In the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita X (2014) SLT 126. the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false complaint against the husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 
42. Along similar lines, the Supreme Court in the case of Ravi Kumar vs. Julmidevi (2010) 4 SCC 476 has categorically held that reckless, false and defamatory allegations against the husband and family members would have an effect of lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society and it amounts to cruelty. Similar observations were made by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Rita vs. Jai Solanki (2017) SCC OnLine Del 9078 and Nishi vs. Jagdish Ram 233 (2016) DLT 50.
43. Thus, making of such false complaints can be termed as nothing but acts of mental cruelty.
44. The persistent conduct of the respondent has been repressive and oppressive towards the appellant, who in order to make their marriage work, had tolerated this behaviour for no less than 20 years. He made every endeavour to be able to cope with the circumstances; to make the marriage work but this long cruel conduct of the respondent, became unbearable for him when he admittedly attempted suicide on 25.10.2001, by consuming poison. The respondent has also admitted that the appellant was taken to Safdarjung hospital, where he remain admitted. 
45. Independently, the individual incidents may seem to be innocuous and make it termed as a normal wear and tear but when considered wholistically, it is evident  that such conduct created such pressure on the appellant that eventually, he felt so cornered and unable to escape from this situation, that he even attempted suicide. There could not have been a more blatant manifestation of his inability to sustain himself in such repressive and toxic environment which was being suffered by the appellant. Such is the conduct of the respondent that no  person can reasonably be expected to put up with such conduct and to continue to live with the other party, as has been held in the Case of Veer Bhagat vs. Dheer Bhagat (1994) 1 SCC 337. 
46. It is evident that the pervasive, blatant and latent conduct of the respondent, has had an injurious impact on the life of the appellant and caused trauma and mental agony to the mind of the appellant, entitling him to Divorce, as has been held in the Case of Shobha Rani vs. Madhukar Reddy (1988) 1 SCC 105.       
47. The appellant had also deposed that he, from time to time, was compelled by the respondent, to give money to his brothers and mother. He had deposed that on 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, brother of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He also transferred Rs.30,000/- in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his plot of land. He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also asked to pay Rs.50,000/- to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of the engagement of her daughter. The appellant refused to give money, which infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from Guwahati, he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/-, at the time of the marriage of another daughter, though he again refused. When the appellant came to Delhi on 29.07.2001, he was illegally detained and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-, through cheque. 
48. Another significant aspect which needs mention is that it is not disputed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat being No. 263, Pocket-3, Madhipur, New Delhi, was booked by the father of the appellant in his  name, which was eventually allotted and possession  handed-over in the year 1990. The appellant along with the respondent, shifted to the said flat but because of the respondent had been influenced by her mother and family members, did not stay in the flat and forced the appellant to sell the flat, to purchase the plot near her mothers house. The appellant eventually sold the flat in the year 1992 and two adjoining plots measuring 100 square yards and 50 square yards respectively, were purchased by the respondent, which were at a distance of about five kilometres, from the parental home of the respondent. The location and the circumstances as deposed by the appellant, reinforce his testimony of he being compelled to sell the flat, to be nearer to the parental home of the respondent. 
49. The appellant had deposed that he raised construction on the plot and shifted there in the year 1992. The appellant had further deposed that in the year 1997, the respondent insisted that the house constructed on 100 square yards plot, be transferred in her name. When the appellant refused, he was threatened with false implication in criminal case by leaving a note implicating him by blaming him for her committing suicide.
50.  The respondent significantly has admitted that a portion of the property bearing No. C-46, Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, near IGNOU, Delhi, was transferred in her name. She tried to give an explanation that the appellant had done the same to save income-tax and denied the suggestion that the appellant transferred the said property in her name on her threat of false implication in a criminal case. The admissions of the respondent in her cross-examination further reinforces the testimony of the appellant that he had been compelled to transfer a portion of his property, in the name of the respondent. 
51. In the circumstances, one can only appreciate the resilience and the tenacity of the appellant who continued to endeavour to live in this matrimonial relationship though he was subjected to such anguish and mental cruelty on a regular basis because of the conduct of the respondent.
52. The parties have separated in the year 2004; the appellant has explained that the respondent left the matrimonial home in March, 2004 but she came back in May, 2004 and threw out the appellant from his own house. To the contrary, the respondent has asserted that the appellant himself left the matrimonial home in May, 2004. While she has asserted so, she has failed to give any explanations of the circumstances of separation in the year 2004, either in her affidavit of evidence or by way of suggestion to the appellant, in the cross-examination. On the other hand, the appellant has been categorical in stating that the respondent herself left the matrimonial home in March, 2004 after she had filed a false complaint against him in Police Station, Mehrauli in which he was detained by the police for the whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. There is not a whisper of word on behalf of the respondent, to explain the circumstances of separation. 
53. Her testimony has been conspicuous by silence in explaining if she ever made any endeavour or effort to join back the company of the appellant. On the other hand, the appellant has explained the conduct of the respondent over a period of about twenty years, which had made it extremely oppressive for him to continue in the matrimonial relationship. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is the respondent, who has not been able to explain the circumstances as to why the appellant left the house. Rather, the evidence and the admissions of the respondent establish that the appellant has always discharged his matrimonial obligations towards the respondent and her family. Such deprivation of conjugal relationship by the respondent since the year 2004, with no effort of re-conciliation, is the ultimate act of rejection of the matrimonial relationship amounting to the extreme cruelty to which a man can be subjected, warranting dissolution of the marriage, as held by the Apex Court in the case of Samar Ghogh v. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511.
54. In the recent case of Rakesh Raman vs. Kavita, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 497, it was observed that long separation and absence of cohabitation along with the complete breakdown of meaningful bonds of matrimony, has to be read as cruelty. It was further observed that the continuation of such a marriage would only mean giving a sanction of cruelty which the respondent has been inflicting on the appellant. 
55.   From the aforesaid discussion, it may be concluded that the respondent since the day of the marriage, had initially a problem of settling in the village. Subsequently, on shifting to Delhi, she under the influence of her mother and family members, compelled the appellant from time to time, to give money to her and the family members. It has also emerged that the appellant had been prevailed to sell his flat to buy property, closer to the house of the respondents parents. Such was the influence of the family of the respondent on her that she essentially was dictated in her conduct by the family members. She went to the extent of lodging three complaints in a span of 20 years, against the appellant but has not been able to prove even an iota of truth in her complaints. Despite such adversity, the appellant had admittedly all throughout discharged his obligations as a husband and a father and had provided for all the financial and other needs of the respondent and his sons and had supported them all through out. In these circumstances, it has to be concluded that the appellant made all endeavours, which lasted for 20 years to bring in matrimonial harmony and peace, but failed miserably. 
56. In view of above, we are of the considered opinion that the acts of respondent can only be termed as acts of cruelty entitling the appellant to a decree of divorce, on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 
57. We hereby set aside the impugned judgment dated 15.03.2017. The Appeal is hereby allowed and the divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, is granted.
58. The decree sheet be prepared accordingly.

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.  
Unfortunate are the matrimonial disputes where the fountain head of 
friction inter se  the spouses is mere lack of adjustment, unders tanding 
and the will to stay together. These factors are the wheels of the char iot 
of a workable marriage and if either spouse becomes   averse  to mov e 
together  and chooses to abandon the relationship, then extensive 
reconciliatory efforts by one spouse, would also not yield any results.   
1. The present Appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 
1955 (hereinafter referred to as “HMA, 1955” ) has been filed on behalf of 
the appellant/husband assailing the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01 .2009 
vide which t he Divorce Petition under Section s 13(1)(ia)  and 13(1)(ib) of  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 2 of 14 
 HMA, 1955 filed on behalf of the appellant/husband , has been dismissed.   
2. The facts in brief as narrated by the appellant/husband  (who was 
the petitioner in the Divorce Petition ), are that the ap pellant/husband got 
married to the respondent/wife according to the Hind u customs and rites on 
16.04. 1994  at Delhi . One daughter was born from their wedlock on 
12.08.1995.   
3. According to the appellant  the respondent/wife (who was the 
respondent in the Divor ce Petition ) started misbehaving within 2 -3 days of 
the marriage and started making demands  for a separate accommodation.  It 
is claimed that the appellant/husband was subjected to various acts of cruelty 
by the respondent by refusing to participate in the  festivals such as 
Janamasthmi  and rejecting the gifts given by the appellant claiming them to 
be cheap.  The appellant/husband has further asserted that the 
respondent/wife again made a demand for a separate kitchen on 12.02.1995 
and an oral settlement was  entered into between the parties on 13.02.1995  
4. In March, 1995, the respondent/wife locked herself in the room and 
refused to open the door and such erratic behaviour caused grave mental 
agony to the appellant/husband.  
5. The appellant/husband has asserted t hat the father of the 
respondent/ wife called him to this office and questioned him as to why the 
respondent/wife was not wearing ornaments at the time of Kirtan  held in the 
house of the appellant/husband.    
6. It was further asserted that the  respondent/wife  was employed as a 
Teacher in the Municipal Corporation School at Patel Nagar, New Delhi  and 
he made every effort to get the transfer of the respondent/wife to Geeta 
Colony. She  had left the matrimonial home and had gone to her parental  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 3 of 14 
 home for enjoying s ummer vacations in May,1995 while she  was in family 
way.  The respondent/wife was admitted in the St. Stephan Hospital  on 10 -
11.06.1995 , where she misbehaved with the appellant/husband and his 
family members in the Hospital . Post discharge from the Hospita l after 3 -4 
days, she went  to the parental home instead of coming back to the 
matrimonial home.  
7. On 29.06.1995, the respondent/wife rejoined her school after the 
summer vacations were over, but instead of returning to the matrimonial 
home, she went to resid e with her Mausi , where she resided till 15.07.1995 . 
During that period, both the appellant/husband and the respondent/wife were 
searching for a rental accommodation, but she did not approve of any 
accommodation. Ultimately, the respondent/wife left her Mausi’s  house and 
went  to reside in her parental home and since then she refused to entertain 
the phone calls of the appellant/husband.   
8. The respondent/wife got admitted at St. Stephan Hospital where she 
gave birth to a daughter on 12.08.1995.  The appellan t/husband and his 
family members visited the respondent/wife in the Hospital, but the brother 
of the respondent/wife misbehaved with them.  It was mutually agreed  that 
post her delivery, she would  resid e in her parental home for 40 days and 
thereafter, she  would join  the appellant/husband in their separate 
accommodation.  Thus, t he appellant/husband took a rented accommodation 
in September, 1995 at Krishan Nagar, Delhi. However, t he respondent/wife 
joined her duty after her maternity leave, but still she did  not join the 
company of the appellant/husband at the rented accommodation.  
9. It is submitted that the respondent/wife and her father in the first week 
of November, 1995 even went to the house of the matrimonial home of the  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 4 of 14 
 appellant/husband ’s sister and th ey misbehaved with the appellant/husband 
which caused great mental agony  to him.  
10. The appellant/husband has also asserted that the respondent/wife had 
visited the office of appellant/husband and shouted at him in the presence of 
his boss.    On 24.11.1995,  the respondent/wife again came to the office of 
appellant/husband and met the Joint Secretary , Ms. Rewa Nayyar  and on h er 
request, the appellant/husband accompanied the respondent/wife  in a TSR  to 
go to their home , but the respondent/wife directed the  TSR to Police Station , 
Tilak Nagar to get the appellant/husband arrested.  In order to save himself, 
the appellant/husband had to jump out of the TSR  and escape . 
11. The appellant/husband thus contended that the respondent/wife has 
been residing away from him since May , 1995 and has refused to join his 
company even in the rented accommodation.  Hence, the divorce was sought 
on the ground of cruelty and desertion.   
12. The respondent/wife has contested the Divorce Petition  and in her 
Written Statement  took the prelimi nary objections that the Divorce Petition 
did not disclose any cause of action and that the appellant/husband himself 
was guilty of cruelty towards the respondent/wife.  
13. The respondent/wife, on merits , denied all the allegations made 
against  her and asserte d that she has always been a sincere and dutiful Hindu 
wife.  She claimed that while she was in advance stage of pregnancy, she 
was not permitted to l ive in her matrimonial home by her   in-laws and 
because out of the compulsion, the respondent/wife went t o stay in the house 
of her Mausi  temporarily.  
14. The respondent/wife often called the appellant/husband to take her 
back to the matrimonial home, but the appellant/husband had no interest.   
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 5 of 14 
 Therefore, the respondent/wife submitted that the Divorce Petition w as 
liable to be dismissed.  
15. On the pleadings, the issues were framed on  26.05.2003  which read as 
under: - 
“(i) Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with 
cruelty as alleged?  OPP  
 
(ii) Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner for 
conti nuous period of not less than two years immediately 
preceding the presentation of petition?  OPP  
 
(iii) Whether the petitioner is trying to take advantage of his 
own wrongs, if so, its effect?  OPR.  
 
(iv) Relief.”   
 
16. The appellant/husband appeared as PW1  and also examined 
PW2/ Rajinder Shah Singh, his family friend and PW3 /K.L. Sikka, the 
landlord of the premises which were taken on rent by the appellant/husband 
from October,  2000 till he came to seek divorce in the Court.  
17. The respondent/wife examined herself as RW1 . 
18. The learned Additional District Judge, referred  to the various 
incidents as narrated by the appellant/husband to conclude that it was the 
appellant/husband who compelled the respondent/wife to live separately and 
made no efforts whatsoever to bring  her back to the matrimonial home.  
Thus, it was concluded that the husband has not been able to substantiate 
any of the allegations and it was the appellant/husband who had committed 
the matrimonial wrong of d eserting his wife without any sufficient cause . 
Therefore, the Divorce Petition was dismissed.  
19. Aggrieved by the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009, the present 
Appeal has been preferred by the appellant/husband.   
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 6 of 14 
 20. Submissions heard from learned counsels for the parties and the 
documents as well as t he record perused.  
Cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia ) of HMA, 1955 :- 
21. Admitted ly, the parties got married on 1 6.04.1994 and from the 
pleading s, it is apparent that the differences arose inter se  the parties soon 
after their marriage.  
22. The respondent/wife ha d been living separately from 26.05 .1995 
which implies that the parties resid ed together for about 13  months and have 
been living separately for the last 30 years. Essentially, the acts of cruelty 
that were alleged by the appellant/husband to have been commit ted by the 
respondent/wife were that she had scant regard for the gifts that the 
appellant/husband gave on her birthday. The respondent/wife refused to 
participate in the festivals like Janmastami  and that she was insisting on a 
separate accommodation.   
23. None of these allegations as claimed by the appellant/husband were 
substantiated  and neither has he made any serious allegation, grave and 
weighty enough to grant divorce on the ground of cruelty which could cause 
reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant/husband that living 
with the wife is unsafe and harmful for him . The Learned Additional District 
Judge has rightly concluded that no acts of cruelty as envisaged under 
Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955 were proved by the appellant/husband ; 
rather th ey were incidents of normal wear and tear and minor initial 
adjustments.  
24. Accordingly, we concur with the findings of the Learned 
Additional District Judge and do find any infirmit y in the conclusions 
so arrived. T herefore , we observe that divorce petition  has rightly  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 7 of 14 
 dismissed by the Ld. ADJ under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955.  
 
Desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955 :- 
25. The appellant/husband had also sought the Divorce on the ground of 
desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955.  
26. The appellant had alleged that after their marriage on 16.04.1994 
there were adjustment issues and alleged cruelties ( though not proved as 
held above ) by the respondent.   
27. The appellant in his testimony had deposed that the respondent who 
was a teacher in MCD School , had gone to her parental home during her 
Summer vacations on 26.05.1995.  The respondent has countered it by 
asserting that in fact on that day she had gone along with the appellant for 
her regular check up to St. Stephens  Hospital, but the appellant instead  of 
bringing her back home after the check up , compelled her to go to her 
parental home.  While she was in her parental home, she was admitted in the 
St. Stephens Hospital on 10/11.6.1995, where she remained admitted for 3 -4 
days but neither the appellant nor his family members came to visit her.  She 
after being discharged, had no option but to go back to her parental home.  
Pertinently, all these facts have been admitted by the appellant in his cross -
examination.  
28.  It further emerges from the respective testimon y of the parties  that 
the school of the respondent re -opened on 29.06.1995 and admittedly she 
went to stay in the house of her maternal aunt.  The respondent had deposed 
that she was compelled to go to her maternal aunt’s house since the 
appellant w as not forthcoming in taking her to the matrimonial home.  
Whereas, t he appellant had asserted in his testimony that respondent herself  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 8 of 14 
 did not return to the matrimonial home , which in fact lends credence to the 
testimony of the respondent that appellant h ad no inclination to take her to 
the matrimonial home. Thus,  it is difficult to accept the contention of the 
appellant that the respondent voluntarily and without their being compelling 
circumstances, would prefer to go to stay in the house of her mausi  instead 
of coming to her matrimonial home.  
29. The respondent had further asserted that on 12.08.1995, on the birth 
of the daughter, neither the appellant nor his family members visited her and 
the hospital expenditure was also borne by her.  The appellant has admitted  
that he was not present in the hospital on the day she was discharged from 
the hospital.  The appellant in his cross -examination has admitted that he 
went to visit her only once in the Hospital and also that the hospital 
expenditure was borne by t he respondent , though he asserted that the same 
was reimbursed by her Department.  It thereby implies that he admittedly 
did not bear the hospital expenditure.   
30. Clearly, the circumstances support the truthfulness of the testimony of 
the respondent.  Admitte dly, since 26.05. 1995 the respondent has been 
staying either at the house of her mausi  and after the delivery she shifted to 
her parental home.  
31. Further, it is admitted by the appellant that prior to delivery of the 
child on 12.08.1995, the respondent alon g with one Mr. Malhotra had visited 
the office of the appellant where Mr. Sourabh, brother and Mr. Sanjay, 
brother -in-law of appellant were already present.  She has deposed that she 
was told by them in clear words that she would not be permitted to live i n 
the matrimonial home which caused her great mental agony resulting in pre -
mature delivery of the child on 12.08.1995 when in fact the date of delivery  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 9 of 14 
 was 26.08.1995.  
32.  That the  appellant  never had any inclination for the respondent to 
return to the matr imonial home is further reinforced from his blatant  
admis sion  in his cross -examination that  he never went to the house of the 
respondent after she was discharged from the hospital post delivery of the 
daughter .  His explanation for the respondent having g one to her parental 
home was that it was agreed that she would stay in her parental home post 
delivery for 40 days and thereafter they would shift to a rented 
accommodation.  While the appellant has claimed that there was an 
understanding of respondent goi ng to live in the parental home, but his own 
admissions that he was not present at the time of discharge of the respondent 
from the hospital , again corroborates the assertions of the respondent that 
appellant had  no interest, whatsoever, in  taking her ba ck to the matrimonial 
home.  
33. The appellant had tried to create a story of having taken the premises 
at Krishna Nagar on rent in September, 1995.  In support of his assertions , 
he has relied on a Rent  Deed Ex.PW1/C  executed between the landlord 
Manjeet Singh  and him self.  Interestingly , while according to the testimony 
of the appellant, he had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995, but 
this Rent  Deed is of November, 1999.  There is no mention in this Rent 
Deed that the appellant  had been in his premis es as a tenant since 1995.   
34. Pertinently, in his cross -examination he was asked to produce a proof 
of having paid rent for the accommodation allegedly taken on rent by him  
pursuant to the insistence of the respondent for separate residence , but he 
had no d ocument whatsoever in support thereof.  His Income Tax Returns 
were put to him where there was no mention of any rent having been paid by  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 10 of 14 
 him.  He also admitted that he had not given any intimation to his 
Department about taking of premises on rent.  The a ppellant has, therefore, 
not been able to establish that the respondent was insisting on a separate 
accommodation or that he to honour her wish , had taken the premises on 
rent in September, 1995.  Once, it is held that the appellant has not been able 
to pr ove that he ever taken any premises on rent in September, 1995, his 
further assertion that despite his intention of taking the respondent to the 
rented accommodation, she herself did not join him , becomes untruthful .  
The appellant has been only creating e vidence by producing a Rent 
Agreement which is also dated 18.11.1999 i.e. of almost four years since 
1995.   
35. Another interesting aspect which emerges from this Lease Deed 
Ex.PW1/C is Clause 7, which reads as under:  
“7. That it has been further agreed betwee n the parties that 
only the tenant/second party himself shall use the said 
tenanted premises under his occupation and no other person 
including his wife , mother, son or any other relation of the 
2nd party shall be entitled to use the said premises without the 
written permission of the 1st party/ landlord -owner.”  
 
36. The appellant has himself conceded to not taking his wife to the 
rented premises.  This further reinforces the testimony of the respondent that 
he never had any intention to take her to the matrimo nial home.  
37. The appellant himself has further deposed that in the first week of 
November, 1995 the respondent along with her father , visited the house of 
in-laws of his sister.  According to the respondent she had gone there with 
an endeavour to seek their intervention for reconciliation of inter -se 
differences between the appellant and the respondent and to convince the  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 11 of 14 
 appellant to take her back in the matrimonial home.  This incident has been 
explained by the respondent in her evidence wherein she has dep osed that as 
soon as she reached the house of the father -in-law of the sister of the 
appellant, the appellant and his brother reached there  and threw out the 
respondent and her father and even abused them.  
38. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation continued further 
when on 18.11.1995 , she met the Head of the Union of which the mother of 
the appellant was a member, but there also she did not succeed.   
39. The appellant in his affidavit of evidence has denied the visit of the 
respondent in the office on 11.08.1995, but admitted  that she with the small 
child , had come  to his office on 24.11.1995 and had met his Officer Ms. 
Reva Nayyar , Joint Secretary who counseled them both and told the 
appellant to take the respondent and the child , to his house.  It is admitted by 
the appellant that while they were on their way to his house in the TSR, he 
got out mid way and left.  The explanation given by him is that the 
respondent had directed the TSR driver to go to the Police Station to get him 
arrested and because o f the fear of getting arrested , he got off mid way.  The 
respondent on the other hand , has explained that after traveling barely 100 
meters , the appellant got the TSR stopped and went away because he did not 
want to take her to his house. This is also corr oborated by the fact that the 
appellant, had miserably failed to prove that he had taken separate premises 
on rent, as was asserted by him.   
40. The testimony of respondent that she persistently made efforts for 
reconciliation, emerges as  truthful because it i s an admitted fact that 
respondent never made any complaint to any Authority be it Police, Legal 
Aid or CAW Cell nor did she initiate any litigation till the divorce petition  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 12 of 14 
 was filed.   
41. It is obvious from the overwhelming evidence as discussed above, 
that the appellant had no inclination whatsoever to take her back with him . 
While he had been compelled by Senior Officer to take her along with him, 
he immediately deserted her mid way by getting out of the TSR.  The 
admissions of the appellant clearly refle ct that he never had any intention to 
take the respondent back to the matrimonial home and has not been able to 
explain any circumstance for his apprehension to le t the respondent be with 
him in his house.  
42. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation a nd to be able to go 
back to the matrimonial home did not end only with an endeavour to contact 
the superior Office of the appellant to intervene.   
43. She admittedly along with her father and brother , took a bus to 
Chandigarh to meet Mr. Kharbanda , maternal u ncle of the appellant who had 
influence on the family of the appellant , as admitted by him in cross -
examination.  Dr. Vinod Narang , cousin brother of appellant was also 
traveling  on the same bus .  The respondent has deposed that she had talked 
to Dr. Vinod  Narang on the way to Chandigarh, but he expressed his 
inability to be able to intervene in their matter because he felt that the family 
of the appellant would not pay heed to his advice.  She made all efforts by 
approaching the family members of the appel lant, but did not meet any 
success.   
44. Her efforts for reconciliation did not end there.  Admittedly, she 
continued her efforts and eventually a meeting was organized on 31.07.1997 
at the Clinic of Dr. Takkar , friend of the appellant’s father at Paschim Vih ar, 
Delhi.  A second meeting at the Clinic took place on 11.09.1997 but it did  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 13 of 14 
 not yield any result because as per the testimony of the respondent, the 
appellant and his father were absolutely adamant on not taking her to the 
matrimonial home.   
45. The entire  evidence , which is essentially not disputed but is admitted  
by the appellant thus, proves that the appellant at every point of time resisted 
the reconciliatory efforts made by the respondent and despite persistent 
efforts of the respondent did not permit her to join him in the matrimonial 
home.  The appellant has also not been able to explain the reason why he 
never went to meet the respondent or make any effort to bring her back.  
46. In order to be able to succeed to prove desertion, two ingredients are 
essen tial :  Factum Deserdendi and Animus Deserendi  i.e. the factum of 
separation, and the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end as 
held in the case of Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati 1956 
SCC OnLine SC 15.   
47. In the present case, the re is no evidence  whatsoever  to prove that the 
respondent had shifted out of the matrimonial home ; without any reasonable 
excuse rather it is established that the appellant compelled her to shift out  It 
is also not proved that the respondent had any animus  or intention to leave 
the matrimonial home.  The appellant has miserably failed to prove that 
the respondent had deserted the appellant. The appellant was thus, 
rightly denied divorce on the ground of Desertion under S.13 (1) (ib) of 
HMA, 1955 by the Ld. ADJ, Delhi.    
 
Conclusion :- 
48. We are conscious that this is a broken marriage where parties are 
residing separately for about 30 years and there is no possibility of reunion  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 14 of 14 
 between the parties. It is a case where the marriage is dead but in recognit ion 
of the principle under S.23 (1)(a) HMA,1955, to grant a Divorce in the 
present case would be to add a premium to the recalcitrant and unreasonable 
conduct of the appellant in unilaterally refusing to discharge his matrimonial 
obligations and has indeed caused undefinable cruelty to the respondent by 
denying her the conjugality without any fault.  
49. We hereby conclude from the aforesaid discussion that the divorce 
petition of the appellant on the ground of cruelty and desertion  under  
S.13(1)(ia) and (ib) HMA,1955 has been rightly dismissed by the learned 
Additional District Judge and does not call for any interference.  
50. The appeal is accordingly dismissed  with pending application(s), 
if any .

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
Unfortunate are the matrimonial disputes where the fountain head of friction inter se the spouses is mere lack of adjustment, understanding and the will to stay together. These factors are the wheels of the chariot of a workable marriage and if either spouse becomes  averse to move together and chooses to abandon the relationship, then extensive reconciliatory efforts by one spouse, would also not yield any results.  
1. The present Appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as HMA, 1955) has been filed on behalf of the appellant/husband assailing the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009 vide which the Divorce Petition under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955 filed on behalf of the appellant/husband, has been dismissed. 
2. The facts in brief as narrated by the appellant/husband (who was the petitioner in the Divorce Petition), are that the appellant/husband got married to the respondent/wife according to the Hindu customs and rites on 16.04.1994 at Delhi. One daughter was born from their wedlock on 12.08.1995. 
3. According to the appellant the respondent/wife (who was the respondent in the Divorce Petition) started misbehaving within 2-3 days of the marriage and started making demands for a separate accommodation.  It is claimed that the appellant/husband was subjected to various acts of cruelty by the respondent by refusing to participate in the festivals such as Janamasthmi and rejecting the gifts given by the appellant claiming them to be cheap. The appellant/husband has further asserted that the respondent/wife again made a demand for a separate kitchen on 12.02.1995 and an oral settlement was entered into between the parties on 13.02.1995 
4. In March, 1995, the respondent/wife locked herself in the room and refused to open the door and such erratic behaviour caused grave mental agony to the appellant/husband.
5. The appellant/husband has asserted that the father of the respondent/wife called him to this office and questioned him as to why the respondent/wife was not wearing ornaments at the time of Kirtan held in the house of the appellant/husband.   
6. It was further asserted that the respondent/wife was employed as a Teacher in the Municipal Corporation School at Patel Nagar, New Delhi and he made every effort to get the transfer of the respondent/wife to Geeta Colony. She had left the matrimonial home and had gone to her parental home for enjoying summer vacations in May,1995 while she  was in family way. The respondent/wife was admitted in the St. Stephan Hospital on 10-11.06.1995, where she misbehaved with the appellant/husband and his family members in the Hospital. Post discharge from the Hospital after 3-4 days, she went to the parental home instead of coming back to the matrimonial home.
7. On 29.06.1995, the respondent/wife rejoined her school after the summer vacations were over, but instead of returning to the matrimonial home, she went to reside with her Mausi, where she resided till 15.07.1995. During that period, both the appellant/husband and the respondent/wife were searching for a rental accommodation, but she did not approve of any accommodation. Ultimately, the respondent/wife left her Mausis house and went to reside in her parental home and since then she refused to entertain the phone calls of the appellant/husband.  
8. The respondent/wife got admitted at St. Stephan Hospital where she gave birth to a daughter on 12.08.1995.  The appellant/husband and his family members visited the respondent/wife in the Hospital, but the brother of the respondent/wife misbehaved with them.  It was mutually agreed that post her delivery, she would reside in her parental home for 40 days and thereafter, she would join the appellant/husband in their separate accommodation. Thus, the appellant/husband took a rented accommodation in September, 1995 at Krishan Nagar, Delhi. However, the respondent/wife joined her duty after her maternity leave, but still she did not join the company of the appellant/husband at the rented accommodation. 
9. It is submitted that the respondent/wife and her father in the first week of November, 1995 even went to the house of the matrimonial home of the appellant/husbands sister and they misbehaved with the appellant/husband which caused great mental agony to him. 
10. The appellant/husband has also asserted that the respondent/wife had visited the office of appellant/husband and shouted at him in the presence of his boss.    On 24.11.1995, the respondent/wife again came to the office of appellant/husband and met the Joint Secretary, Ms. Rewa Nayyar and on her request, the appellant/husband accompanied the respondent/wife in a TSR to go to their home, but the respondent/wife directed the TSR to Police Station, Tilak Nagar to get the appellant/husband arrested.  In order to save himself, the appellant/husband had to jump out of the TSR and escape.
11. The appellant/husband thus contended that the respondent/wife has been residing away from him since May, 1995 and has refused to join his company even in the rented accommodation.  Hence, the divorce was sought on the ground of cruelty and desertion.  
12. The respondent/wife has contested the Divorce Petition and in her Written Statement took the preliminary objections that the Divorce Petition did not disclose any cause of action and that the appellant/husband himself was guilty of cruelty towards the respondent/wife.
13. The respondent/wife, on merits, denied all the allegations made against her and asserted that she has always been a sincere and dutiful Hindu wife.  She claimed that while she was in advance stage of pregnancy, she was not permitted to live in her matrimonial home by her   in-laws and because out of the compulsion, the respondent/wife went to stay in the house of her Mausi temporarily. 
14. The respondent/wife often called the appellant/husband to take her back to the matrimonial home, but the appellant/husband had no interest.  Therefore, the respondent/wife submitted that the Divorce Petition was liable to be dismissed. 
15. On the pleadings, the issues were framed on 26.05.2003 which read as under: -
(i)	Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty as alleged?	OPP

(ii)	Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner for continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of petition?	OPP

(iii)	Whether the petitioner is trying to take advantage of his own wrongs, if so, its effect?	OPR.

(iv)	Relief.	

16. The appellant/husband appeared as PW1 and also examined PW2/Rajinder Shah Singh, his family friend and PW3/K.L. Sikka, the landlord of the premises which were taken on rent by the appellant/husband from October, 2000 till he came to seek divorce in the Court. 
17. The respondent/wife examined herself as RW1.
18. The learned Additional District Judge, referred to the various incidents as narrated by the appellant/husband to conclude that it was the appellant/husband who compelled the respondent/wife to live separately and made no efforts whatsoever to bring her back to the matrimonial home.  Thus, it was concluded that the husband has not been able to substantiate any of the allegations and it was the appellant/husband who had committed the matrimonial wrong of deserting his wife without any sufficient cause. Therefore, the Divorce Petition was dismissed. 
19. Aggrieved by the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009, the present Appeal has been preferred by the appellant/husband. 
20. Submissions heard from learned counsels for the parties and the documents as well as the record perused. 
Cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955:-
21. Admittedly, the parties got married on 16.04.1994 and from the pleadings, it is apparent that the differences arose inter se the parties soon after their marriage.
22. The respondent/wife had been living separately from 26.05.1995 which implies that the parties resided together for about 13 months and have been living separately for the last 30 years. Essentially, the acts of cruelty that were alleged by the appellant/husband to have been committed by the respondent/wife were that she had scant regard for the gifts that the appellant/husband gave on her birthday. The respondent/wife refused to participate in the festivals like Janmastami and that she was insisting on a separate accommodation.  
23. None of these allegations as claimed by the appellant/husband were substantiated and neither has he made any serious allegation, grave and weighty enough to grant divorce on the ground of cruelty which could cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant/husband that living with the wife is unsafe and harmful for him. The Learned Additional District Judge has rightly concluded that no acts of cruelty as envisaged under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955 were proved by the appellant/husband; rather they were incidents of normal wear and tear and minor initial adjustments. 
24. Accordingly, we concur with the findings of the Learned Additional District Judge and do find any infirmity in the conclusions so arrived. Therefore, we observe that divorce petition has rightly dismissed by the Ld. ADJ under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955.

Desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955:-
25. The appellant/husband had also sought the Divorce on the ground of desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955. 
26. The appellant had alleged that after their marriage on 16.04.1994 there were adjustment issues and alleged cruelties (though not proved as held above) by the respondent.  
27. The appellant in his testimony had deposed that the respondent who was a teacher in MCD School, had gone to her parental home during her Summer vacations on 26.05.1995.  The respondent has countered it by asserting that in fact on that day she had gone along with the appellant for her regular check up to St. Stephens Hospital, but the appellant instead of bringing her back home after the check up, compelled her to go to her parental home.  While she was in her parental home, she was admitted in the St. Stephens Hospital on 10/11.6.1995, where she remained admitted for 3-4 days but neither the appellant nor his family members came to visit her.  She after being discharged, had no option but to go back to her parental home.  Pertinently, all these facts have been admitted by the appellant in his cross-examination. 
28.  It further emerges from the respective testimony of the parties that the school of the respondent re-opened on 29.06.1995 and admittedly she went to stay in the house of her maternal aunt.  The respondent had deposed that she was compelled to go to her maternal aunts house since the appellant was not forthcoming in taking her to the matrimonial home.  Whereas, the appellant had asserted in his testimony that respondent herself did not return to the matrimonial home, which in fact lends credence to the testimony of the respondent that appellant had no inclination to take her to the matrimonial home. Thus, it is difficult to accept the contention of the appellant that the respondent voluntarily and without their being compelling circumstances, would prefer to go to stay in the house of her mausi instead of coming to her matrimonial home. 
29. The respondent had further asserted that on 12.08.1995, on the birth of the daughter, neither the appellant nor his family members visited her and the hospital expenditure was also borne by her.  The appellant has admitted that he was not present in the hospital on the day she was discharged from the hospital.  The appellant in his cross-examination has admitted that he went to visit her only once in the Hospital and also that the hospital expenditure was borne by the respondent, though he asserted that the same was reimbursed by her Department.  It thereby implies that he admittedly did not bear the hospital expenditure. 
30. Clearly, the circumstances support the truthfulness of the testimony of the respondent. Admittedly, since 26.05.1995 the respondent has been staying either at the house of her mausi and after the delivery she shifted to her parental home. 
31. Further, it is admitted by the appellant that prior to delivery of the child on 12.08.1995, the respondent along with one Mr. Malhotra had visited the office of the appellant where Mr. Sourabh, brother and Mr. Sanjay, brother-in-law of appellant were already present.  She has deposed that she was told by them in clear words that she would not be permitted to live in the matrimonial home which caused her great mental agony resulting in pre-mature delivery of the child on 12.08.1995 when in fact the date of delivery was 26.08.1995.
32.  That the  appellant never had any inclination for the respondent to return to the matrimonial home is further reinforced from his blatant admission  in his cross-examination that he never went to the house of the respondent after she was discharged from the hospital post delivery of the daughter.  His explanation for the respondent having gone to her parental home was that it was agreed that she would stay in her parental home post delivery for 40 days and thereafter they would shift to a rented accommodation.  While the appellant has claimed that there was an understanding of respondent going to live in the parental home, but his own admissions that he was not present at the time of discharge of the respondent from the hospital, again corroborates the assertions of the respondent that appellant had  no interest, whatsoever, in  taking her back to the matrimonial home.
33. The appellant had tried to create a story of having taken the premises at Krishna Nagar on rent in September, 1995.  In support of his assertions, he has relied on a Rent Deed Ex.PW1/C executed between the landlord Manjeet Singh and himself.  Interestingly, while according to the testimony of the appellant, he had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995, but this Rent Deed is of November, 1999.  There is no mention in this Rent Deed that the appellant had been in his premises as a tenant since 1995.  
34. Pertinently, in his cross-examination he was asked to produce a proof of having paid rent for the accommodation allegedly taken on rent by him pursuant to the insistence of the respondent for separate residence, but he had no document whatsoever in support thereof.  His Income Tax Returns were put to him where there was no mention of any rent having been paid by him.  He also admitted that he had not given any intimation to his Department about taking of premises on rent.  The appellant has, therefore, not been able to establish that the respondent was insisting on a separate accommodation or that he to honour her wish, had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995.  Once, it is held that the appellant has not been able to prove that he ever taken any premises on rent in September, 1995, his further assertion that despite his intention of taking the respondent to the rented accommodation, she herself did not join him, becomes untruthful.  The appellant has been only creating evidence by producing a Rent Agreement which is also dated 18.11.1999 i.e. of almost four years since 1995. 
35. Another interesting aspect which emerges from this Lease Deed Ex.PW1/C is Clause 7, which reads as under:
7. That it has been further agreed between the parties that only the tenant/second party himself shall use the said tenanted premises under his occupation and no other person including his wife, mother, son or any other relation of the 2nd party shall be entitled to use the said premises without the written permission of the 1st party/ landlord-owner.

36. The appellant has himself conceded to not taking his wife to the rented premises.  This further reinforces the testimony of the respondent that he never had any intention to take her to the matrimonial home.
37. The appellant himself has further deposed that in the first week of November, 1995 the respondent along with her father, visited the house of in-laws of his sister.  According to the respondent she had gone there with an endeavour to seek their intervention for reconciliation of inter-se differences between the appellant and the respondent and to convince the appellant to take her back in the matrimonial home.  This incident has been explained by the respondent in her evidence wherein she has deposed that as soon as she reached the house of the father-in-law of the sister of the appellant, the appellant and his brother reached there  and threw out the respondent and her father and even abused them.
38. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation continued further when on 18.11.1995, she met the Head of the Union of which the mother of the appellant was a member, but there also she did not succeed.  
39. The appellant in his affidavit of evidence has denied the visit of the respondent in the office on 11.08.1995, but admitted that she with the small child, had come to his office on 24.11.1995 and had met his Officer Ms. Reva Nayyar, Joint Secretary who counseled them both and told the appellant to take the respondent and the child, to his house.  It is admitted by the appellant that while they were on their way to his house in the TSR, he got out mid way and left.  The explanation given by him is that the respondent had directed the TSR driver to go to the Police Station to get him arrested and because of the fear of getting arrested, he got off mid way.  The respondent on the other hand, has explained that after traveling barely 100 meters, the appellant got the TSR stopped and went away because he did not want to take her to his house. This is also corroborated by the fact that the appellant, had miserably failed to prove that he had taken separate premises on rent, as was asserted by him. 
40. The testimony of respondent that she persistently made efforts for reconciliation, emerges as truthful because it is an admitted fact that respondent never made any complaint to any Authority be it Police, Legal Aid or CAW Cell nor did she initiate any litigation till the divorce petition was filed.  
41. It is obvious from the overwhelming evidence as discussed above, that the appellant had no inclination whatsoever to take her back with him. While he had been compelled by Senior Officer to take her along with him, he immediately deserted her mid way by getting out of the TSR.  The admissions of the appellant clearly reflect that he never had any intention to take the respondent back to the matrimonial home and has not been able to explain any circumstance for his apprehension to let the respondent be with him in his house.
42. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation and to be able to go back to the matrimonial home did not end only with an endeavour to contact the superior Office of the appellant to intervene.  
43. She admittedly along with her father and brother, took a bus to Chandigarh to meet Mr. Kharbanda, maternal uncle of the appellant who had influence on the family of the appellant, as admitted by him in cross-examination.  Dr. Vinod Narang, cousin brother of appellant was also traveling on the same bus.  The respondent has deposed that she had talked to Dr. Vinod Narang on the way to Chandigarh, but he expressed his inability to be able to intervene in their matter because he felt that the family of the appellant would not pay heed to his advice.  She made all efforts by approaching the family members of the appellant, but did not meet any success.  
44. Her efforts for reconciliation did not end there.  Admittedly, she continued her efforts and eventually a meeting was organized on 31.07.1997 at the Clinic of Dr. Takkar, friend of the appellants father at Paschim Vihar, Delhi.  A second meeting at the Clinic took place on 11.09.1997 but it did not yield any result because as per the testimony of the respondent, the appellant and his father were absolutely adamant on not taking her to the matrimonial home.  
45. The entire evidence, which is essentially not disputed but is admitted by the appellant thus, proves that the appellant at every point of time resisted the reconciliatory efforts made by the respondent and despite persistent efforts of the respondent did not permit her to join him in the matrimonial home.  The appellant has also not been able to explain the reason why he never went to meet the respondent or make any effort to bring her back.
46. In order to be able to succeed to prove desertion, two ingredients are essential : Factum Deserdendi and Animus Deserendi i.e. the factum of separation, and the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end as held in the case of Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati 1956 SCC OnLine SC 15. 
47. In the present case, there is no evidence whatsoever to prove that the respondent had shifted out of the matrimonial home; without any reasonable excuse rather it is established that the appellant compelled her to shift out It is also not proved that the respondent had any animus or intention to leave the matrimonial home.  The appellant has miserably failed to prove that the respondent had deserted the appellant. The appellant was thus, rightly denied divorce on the ground of Desertion under S.13 (1) (ib) of HMA, 1955 by the Ld. ADJ, Delhi.  

Conclusion:-
48. We are conscious that this is a broken marriage where parties are residing separately for about 30 years and there is no possibility of reunion between the parties. It is a case where the marriage is dead but in recognition of the principle under S.23 (1)(a) HMA,1955, to grant a Divorce in the present case would be to add a premium to the recalcitrant and unreasonable conduct of the appellant in unilaterally refusing to discharge his matrimonial obligations and has indeed caused undefinable cruelty to the respondent by denying her the conjugality without any fault. 
49. We hereby conclude from the aforesaid discussion that the divorce petition of the appellant on the ground of cruelty and desertion under S.13(1)(ia) and (ib) HMA,1955 has been rightly dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge and does not call for any interference.
50. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with pending application(s), if any.

Chapter II, Rule 5 of Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read 
with Section 151 CPC for Recall/Setting Aside of the Order Dated 
31.05. 2022  closing the right of the def endants to file a Written Statement ) 
 
O.A.76/2022  (Chambers Appeal under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High 
Court Rules on behalf of Defendant NO.4 against the Order Dated 
31.05.2022 ) 
 
7. The Chamber Appeal  bearing  No. 38/2022  has been filed under 
Chapter II  Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read 
with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3  for 
recalling/modification/setting -aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which 
the learned Joint Registrar has closed the rig ht of the defendants to file a 
Written Statement,  by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the 
date of service, has already expired.  
8. It is asserted in the application that the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 
entered appearance in the captioned Suit o n 14.01.2022  however, due to the 
peak of Covid P andemic, the Written Statement could not be filed. Further, 
as per the Order dated 10.01.2022 passed by the Supreme Court in Suo Moto  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 3 of 9 
 Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020 , the period from 15.03.2020 to 
28.02. 2022 stood excluded for the purposes of limitation and a further 
period of 90 days was provided in cases where the limitation stood expired 
between 15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. Thus, the defendants Nos. 1,2 and 3 
believed that they had upto 30.05.2020 to fil ed their Written Statement.  
9. It is also submitted that on 31.05.2022, the Written Statement could 
not be filed on their behalf as defendant No.2 was out of town. The learned 
Counsel on their behalf had appeared on 31.05.2022 and requested the Court 
to grant  them three days time to file the Written Statement however, their 
right to file the same was closed by the learned Joint Registrar.  It is 
submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 14.07.2022 and the same 
may be permitted to be taken on record.  
10. Aggrieved by the O rder, the Appeal has been preferred.  
11. The Chamber Appeal bearing No. 76/2022   has been filed under 
Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read 
with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant No. 4 for 
recalling /modification/setting -aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which 
the learned Joint Registrar has closed the right of the defendant to file a 
Written Statement, by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the 
date of service, has already expired . 
12. It is asserted in the application that vide Order dated 14.01.2022, the 
defendant No.4 was directed to file the Written Statement within 4 weeks.  
However, due to the bad health of the applicant/defendant No.4, the same 
was not finalised in time and on 3 1.05.2022, the defendant No. 4 requested 
the learned Joint Registrar for a further time of four weeks to file the Written 
Statement. However, the same was declined and the right of the defendant  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 4 of 9 
 No.4 to file a Written Statement was closed vide Order dated 31.05.2022.  
13. It is submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 25.07.2022 
however the same was put under objection and the same was re -filed after 
removing the objections; the same may be permitted to be taken on record.  
14. Aggrieved by the Order dated 3 1.05.2022, the present Appeal has 
been preferred.  The medical record of defendant No4 has also been filed.  
15. Submissions heard.  
16. The moot issue which arises for determination  in both the applications 
is whether in a regular Civil Suit, the timeline of 120 day s as prescribed 
under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC, 1908 read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the 
Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 can be extended beyond the 
said timeline.  
17. Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC provides that the defendant shall file its 
Written Stat ement w ithin 30 days from the date of service of summons upon 
him which may be extended by 90 days for sufficient reasons.; i.e. defendant 
may be given a maximum of 120 days for filing the Written Statement.  
18. Likewise, Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High C ourt (Original Side) 
Rules, 2018 provides for the extension that can be granted by courts if the 
Written Statement is not filed within 30 days of being served. The provision 
reads as  under:  
“4. Extension of time for filing written statement .--If the 
Court is satisfied that the defendant was prevented by 
sufficient cause for exceptional and unavoidable reasons in 
filing the written statement within 30 days, it may extend the 
time for filing the same by a further period not exceeding 90 
days, but not thereaft er. For such extension of time, the party 
in delay shall be burdened with costs as deemed appropriate.  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 5 of 9 
 The written statement shall not be taken on record unless such 
costs have been paid/ deposited. In case the defendant fails to 
file the affidavit of admi ssion/ denial of documents filed by the 
plaintiff, the documents filed by the plaintiff shall be deemed to 
be admitted. In case, no written statement is filed within the 
extended time also, the Registrar may pass orders for closing 
the right to file the wr itten statement. ” 
 
19. The above provision  of Delhi High Court Rules also provide s that a 
total period of 120 days can be granted for filing a Written Statement.  
20. The entire gravamen rests on the interpretation of the words “ but not 
thereafter ” which finds a co nspicuous place of mention in Chapter VII Rule 
4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018.  
21. In the case of Gautam Gambir v. M/s. Jai Ambe Traders and Ors.  
273(2020) DLT 49 , this Court emphasized on the words “but not 
thereafter ” mentioned in the Rule 4, of Chapter VII of the Delhi High Court 
Rules, 2018, to observe that these words clearly indicate that a total of 120 
days granted for filing of written statement cannot be extended, and if the 
same is not complied with, then the Registrar may pass orders closing the 
right to file the same.  
22. In the case of  Ram Sarup Lugani  v. Nirmal Lugani  276 (2021) DLT 
681(DB ), the Division Bench of this Court upheld the Delhi High Court 
(Original) Rules, 2018 to hold that the said Rules shall prevail over the Code 
of Civil Procedure. The inherent powers contemplated in Chapter I Rule 16 
of the said Rules are not to be exercised over to overcome or circumvent the 
limitation expressly provided under Chapter VII of the Rules. The phrase 
“but not thereafter ”, though in the context of filing of a Replication, was 
interpreted and it was observed that the words  not thereafter  must clearly be  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 6 of 9 
 accorded due weight and the timeline provided could not be extended by the 
Courts or take the replication on record after the time has  been exhausted by 
the party.  
23. This aspect was comprehensively considered by the Coordinate Bench 
of this Court in the c ase of Ms Charu Agrawal v. Mr Alok Kalia & Ors.  
Neutra l Citation No. 2023/DHC/001454 . It was observed that neither Order 
VIII CPC nor any  other provisions in the Code employ the phrase “but not 
thereafter”. This expression stands enshrined in both Rules 4 and 5 of the 
Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018. It was further held that the 
usage of this expression was indicative of a term inal point beyond which it 
was impermissible to accept the Written Statement. The inherent powers of 
the Court cannot be invoked to condone any delay beyond 120 days, in light 
of the emphatic language of the provision itself. The court relied on the case 
of  Ram Sarup Lugani  (supra) to observe that the phrase “ but not thereafter ” 
must clearly be accorded due weight.  
24. The Co -ordinate Bench of this Court in Ms. Charu Agarwal  (supra), 
considered the entire compendium of the judgments on this aspect to 
reiterate  that there cannot be an extension of period of 120 days for the filing 
of the Written Statement.  
25. The Co -ordinate Bench in Col Ashish Khanna SM Retd vs. Delhi 
Gymkhana Club & Ors . CS(OS) 171/22, decided on 21.08.2023, while 
considering the similar controve rsy relied upon the case of Ms.Charu 
Agrawal (Supra); Ram Sarup Lugani  (Supra) and Harjyoti Singh vs. 
Manpreet Kaur , 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2629, to  observe  the inviolability of 
the hard stop period of 120 days prescribed in Chapter VII, Rule 4 of the 
Delhi H igh Court  Rules, 2018, for filing of Written Statement and concluded  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 7 of 9 
 that the debate of the power of the Court to condone the delay in filing the 
written statement beyond 120 days in a non - commercial suit, has been 
settled and the Courts have no power to condone this delay beyond 120 
days.  
26. In view of the above discussed law, it is evident that in view of Order 
VIII Rule 1 CPC read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court 
(Original Side) Rules, 2018, only a maximum extension of 90 days can be 
granted  beyond the initial 30 days, which however is not a matter of right. 
Further, the words ""but not thereafter”  makes it unequivocally clear that in 
no circumstance can an extension beyond 120 (30 + 90) days, can be 
granted.  
Analysis:  
27. Perusal of the record s hows that the Suit for Declaration, Specific 
Performance and Permanent and Perpetual Injunction was filed by the 
Plaintiffs on 15.11.2019. The summons in the Suit was served upon the 
defendant  Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on 10.12.2021 and on defendant No.4 on 
16.12.20 21. 
28. It is pertinent to note that defendant No.1 is the Ajay Kumar , HUF  
and the defendant No 2 is Mr. Ajay Gupta and their  summons was served 
upon   Defendant No.3, Mrs. Nina Gupta who is the wife of Defendant No.2 
Mr Ajay Gupta .  
29. Furthe r, the summons was se rved upon defendant No.4 through his 
wife Kiran Gupta.  
30.  Order 5 Rule 15, CPC , provides that if the defendant is absent from 
his residence at the time when the service of summons is sought to be 
effected on him at his residence, he may be served through any  adult  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 8 of 9 
 member of the family whether male or female, who is residing with him . 
31. There is no denial by defendant No. 1 and 2 that the summons were 
received by the wife or that they had no knowledge of the summons. In fact, 
the same counsel had appeared on beh alf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 
which shows that the summons was validly served upon them on 
10.12.2021 . Admittedly, all the three defendant  Nos. 1, 2 and 3  had put in 
appearance through their counsel for the first time on 14.01.2022. Having 
been serv ed on 10.12.2021 , they should have filed the Written Statem ent 
within 120 days i.e. upto 09.04.2021 .  
32. Similarly, the service has also not been disputed by defendant No.4 
and having been served on 16.12.2021, the Written Statement should have 
been filed on his behalf within 120 days as well i.e. upto 15.04.2021.  
33. However, t his period came within the COVID -19 Pandemic period 
and in view of the decision in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020  
(Supra),  the period of limitation for cases where limitation expired in 
between 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022  was extended by 90 days from  
01.03.2022, i.e. till 30.05.2022.  However , the Written Statement has not 
even been filed  in that extended period  by the defendant nos. 1,2,3, and 4 . 
34. Admittedly , the Written Statemen t had been filed on behalf of 
defendant nos. 1,2 and 3 only on 1 4.07.2022  but a perusal of the noting 
shows that the same was also returned under objections . Similarly,  the 
defendant No.4 has filed the Wr itten Statement on 21.07.2022 but the s ame 
was retur ned under objections .  
35. Evidently, t he applicant s/defendant No s. 1,2 3 and 4 have failed to file 
the Written Statement  within the period of 120 days which is not extendable 
beyond the def ined period , as discussed above.   
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 9 of 9 
 36. Therefore, the Application s are witho ut any merit and hereby 
dismissed.

O.A.76/2022 (Chambers Appeal under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court Rules on behalf of Defendant NO.4 against the Order Dated 31.05.2022)

7. The Chamber Appeal bearing No. 38/2022 has been filed under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for recalling/modification/setting-aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which the learned Joint Registrar has closed the right of the defendants to file a Written Statement, by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the date of service, has already expired.
8. It is asserted in the application that the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 entered appearance in the captioned Suit on 14.01.2022  however, due to the peak of Covid Pandemic, the Written Statement could not be filed. Further, as per the Order dated 10.01.2022 passed by the Supreme Court in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020, the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 stood excluded for the purposes of limitation and a further period of 90 days was provided in cases where the limitation stood expired between 15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. Thus, the defendants Nos. 1,2 and 3 believed that they had upto 30.05.2020 to filed their Written Statement.

14. Aggrieved by the Order dated 31.05.2022, the present Appeal has been preferred. The medical record of defendant No4 has also been filed.
15. Submissions heard.
16. The moot issue which arises for determination in both the applications is whether in a regular Civil Suit, the timeline of 120 days as prescribed under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC, 1908 read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 can be extended beyond the said timeline.
17. Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC provides that the defendant shall file its Written Statement within 30 days from the date of service of summons upon him which may be extended by 90 days for sufficient reasons.; i.e. defendant may be given a maximum of 120 days for filing the Written Statement.
18. Likewise, Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 provides for the extension that can be granted by courts if the Written Statement is not filed within 30 days of being served. The provision reads as under:
4. Extension of time for filing written statement.--If the Court is satisfied that the defendant was prevented by sufficient cause for exceptional and unavoidable reasons in filing the written statement within 30 days, it may extend the time for filing the same by a further period not exceeding 90 days, but not thereafter. For such extension of time, the party in delay shall be burdened with costs as deemed appropriate. The written statement shall not be taken on record unless such costs have been paid/ deposited. In case the defendant fails to file the affidavit of admission/ denial of documents filed by the plaintiff, the documents filed by the plaintiff shall be deemed to be admitted. In case, no written statement is filed within the extended time also, the Registrar may pass orders for closing the right to file the written statement.

19. The above provision of Delhi High Court Rules also provides that a total period of 120 days can be granted for filing a Written Statement.
20. The entire gravamen rests on the interpretation of the words but not thereafter which finds a conspicuous place of mention in Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018.
21. In the case of Gautam Gambir v. M/s. Jai Ambe Traders and Ors. 273(2020) DLT 49, this Court emphasized on the words but not thereafter mentioned in the Rule 4, of Chapter VII of the Delhi High Court Rules, 2018, to observe that these words clearly indicate that a total of 120 days granted for filing of written statement cannot be extended, and if the same is not complied with, then the Registrar may pass orders closing the right to file the same.
22. In the case of Ram Sarup Lugani v. Nirmal Lugani 276 (2021) DLT 681(DB), the Division Bench of this Court upheld the Delhi High Court (Original) Rules, 2018 to hold that the said Rules shall prevail over the Code of Civil Procedure. The inherent powers contemplated in Chapter I Rule 16 of the said Rules are not to be exercised over to overcome or circumvent the limitation expressly provided under Chapter VII of the Rules. The phrase but not thereafter, though in the context of filing of a Replication, was interpreted and it was observed that the words not thereafter must clearly be accorded due weight and the timeline provided could not be extended by the Courts or take the replication on record after the time has been exhausted by the party.
23. This aspect was comprehensively considered by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Ms Charu Agrawal v. Mr Alok Kalia & Ors. Neutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001454. It was observed that neither Order VIII CPC nor any other provisions in the Code employ the phrase but not thereafter. This expression stands enshrined in both Rules 4 and 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018. It was further held that the usage of this expression was indicative of a terminal point beyond which it was impermissible to accept the Written Statement. The inherent powers of the Court cannot be invoked to condone any delay beyond 120 days, in light of the emphatic language of the provision itself. The court relied on the case of  Ram Sarup Lugani (supra) to observe that the phrase but not thereafter must clearly be accorded due weight.
24. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ms. Charu Agarwal (supra), considered the entire compendium of the judgments on this aspect to reiterate that there cannot be an extension of period of 120 days for the filing of the Written Statement.
25. The Co-ordinate Bench in Col Ashish Khanna SM Retd vs. Delhi Gymkhana Club & Ors. CS(OS) 171/22, decided on 21.08.2023, while considering the similar controversy relied upon the case of Ms.Charu Agrawal (Supra); Ram Sarup Lugani (Supra) and Harjyoti Singh vs. Manpreet Kaur, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2629, to observe the inviolability of the hard stop period of 120 days prescribed in Chapter VII, Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court Rules, 2018, for filing of Written Statement and concluded that the debate of the power of the Court to condone the delay in filing the written statement beyond 120 days in a non- commercial suit, has been settled and the Courts have no power to condone this delay beyond 120 days.
26. In view of the above discussed law, it is evident that in view of Order VIII Rule 1 CPC read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018, only a maximum extension of 90 days can be granted beyond the initial 30 days, which however is not a matter of right. Further, the words ""but not thereafter makes it unequivocally clear that in no circumstance can an extension beyond 120 (30 + 90) days, can be granted. 
Analysis:
27. Perusal of the record shows that the Suit for Declaration, Specific Performance and Permanent and Perpetual Injunction was filed by the Plaintiffs on 15.11.2019. The summons in the Suit was served upon the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on 10.12.2021 and on defendant No.4 on 16.12.2021.
28. It is pertinent to note that defendant No.1 is the Ajay Kumar, HUF and the defendant No 2 is Mr. Ajay Gupta and their summons was served upon  Defendant No.3, Mrs. Nina Gupta who is the wife of Defendant No.2 Mr Ajay Gupta. 
29. Further, the summons was served upon defendant No.4 through his wife Kiran Gupta.
30.  Order 5 Rule 15, CPC, provides that if the defendant is absent from his residence at the time when the service of summons is sought to be effected on him at his residence, he may be served through any adult member of the family whether male or female, who is residing with him.
31. There is no denial by defendant No. 1 and 2 that the summons were received by the wife or that they had no knowledge of the summons. In fact, the same counsel had appeared on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 which shows that the summons was validly served upon them on 10.12.2021. Admittedly, all the three defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 had put in appearance through their counsel for the first time on 14.01.2022. Having been served on 10.12.2021, they should have filed the Written Statement within 120 days i.e. upto 09.04.2021. 
32. Similarly, the service has also not been disputed by defendant No.4 and having been served on 16.12.2021, the Written Statement should have been filed on his behalf within 120 days as well i.e. upto 15.04.2021.
33. However, this period came within the COVID-19 Pandemic period and in view of the decision in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020 (Supra), the period of limitation for cases where limitation expired in between 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 was extended by 90 days from 01.03.2022, i.e. till 30.05.2022. However, the Written Statement has not even been filed in that extended period by the defendant nos. 1,2,3, and 4.
34. Admittedly, the Written Statement had been filed on behalf of defendant nos. 1,2 and 3 only on 14.07.2022 but a perusal of the noting shows that the same was also returned under objections. Similarly, the defendant No.4 has filed the Written Statement on 21.07.2022 but the same was returned under objections. 
35. Evidently, the applicants/defendant Nos. 1,2 3 and 4 have failed to file the Written Statement within the period of 120 days which is not extendable beyond the defined period, as discussed above.
36. Therefore, the Applications are without any merit and hereby dismissed.

4.1 To be noted, the appellant/husband has instituted a petition for
divorce under Section 13 (1)(ia) of the HMA.
5. Ms. Shikha Kaushik, learned counsel, who appears on behalf of the
appellant/husband, says that the learned Additional Principal Judge did not
apply his mind independently. Ms Kaushik says that the impugned order is
pivoted on borrowed satisfaction drawn from the order of maintenance
ordered by the same Judge in proceedings instituted under Section 125 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [in short, “CrPC”]. Furthermore, Ms
Kaushik says that the appellant/husband has assailed the order passed under
Section 125 of the CrPC in a revision action.
5.1 It is, therefore, Ms. Kaushik’s submission that this appeal has been
filed to preserve the appellant’s/husband’s right to prosecute the revision
action.
6. We have perused the order passed by the learned Family Court. The
Family Court has recorded that the appellant/husband is earning
approximately Rs.14,40,000/- per month, excluding incentives and bonus.
6.1 Concededly, this fact emerged in the appellant /husband’s cross-
examination recorded on 26.08.2023.
6.2 Qua this aspect, it is Ms. Kaushik’s submission that the learned
Additional Principal Judge failed to take into account the corresponding
expenses that the appellant/husband has to incur at the place where he is
located.
7. We are informed that the appellant/husband is based in Singapore.
8. According to us, even if we were to factor in the expenses that theMAT.APP.(F.C.) 71/2024 Page 3 of 3appellant/husband may incur in Singapore, even then, the maintenance
awarded to the respondent/wife at the rate of Rs.75,000/- per month does not
seem to be unreasonable. Furthermore, the learned Additional Principal
Judge has also indicated in paragraph 7 of the impugned order that the
amount paid to the respondent/wife in any other proceedings shall stand
adjusted against the maintenance ordered by him viathe impugned order.
9. We find no reason to interfere with the impugned order.

  YASHWANT VARMA, J. (Oral)  
1. The writ petitioner has approached this Court aggrieved by  the 
adjustment of a disputed tax demand pertaining to Assessment Year1
                                           
1 AY  
2018 -19 against refunds which were due to it for AYs ’ 2010 -11, 2011 -
12 and 2020- 21. The challenge is principally raised in the backdrop of 
the aforesaid adjustment having been made des pite the petitioner 
having moved a rectification application pertaining to the final   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 2 of 19 
 assessment which was framed for AY 2018 -19 and an admitted failure 
on the part of the respondents to consider and dispose of the stay 
application which was moved and was r eferable to Section 220(6) of 
the Income Tax Act, 19612
2. The petitioner filed its Return of Income.  It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the 
petitioner has prayed for the refund being processed after adjustment of 
20% of the disputed demand for AY 2018- 19. For the purposes of 
examining the reliefs  which are claimed , we deem it apposite to notice 
the following facts.  
3 for AY 2018 -19 on 29 
September 2018 claiming a refund of INR 6,45,65,160/ - on account of 
excess Taxes Deducted at Source4
3. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner preferred an appeal 
before the Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals) , National 
Faceless Appeal Centre which was deducted during the 
course of the said yea r.  In the course of processing of that ROI, notices 
under Section 143(2) and 14 2(1) of the Act came to be issued on 22 
September 2019 and 09 January 2020 respectively. On 16 November 2019 , the petitioner received an intimation,  referable to Section 143(1)  
of the Act,  apprising it of an amount of INR 6, 42,30,413/- being 
refundable along with interest. However, when the assessment was 
ultimately framed and a formal order was passed under Section 143(3) 
read with Section 144B  of the Act, various additions came to be made 
to the income disclosed in the R OI and leading to the creation of a 
demand of INR 10, 26,85,633/-. 
5
                                           
2 Act , which is stated to be pending.

4 TDS  
5 CIT(A), NFAC    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 3 of 19 
 Simultaneously , it also moved an application purporting to be under 
Section 154 of the Act for correction of rectifiable mistakes which 
according to it were apparent on the face of the record.  Along with  the 
rectification application , the petitioner on 28 May 2021 also filed a stay 
application in respect of the demand so raised. The rectification 
application however came to be perfunctorily rejected in terms of an 
order dated 07 June 2021 which is reproduced hereinbelow:  
“Sub: Rectification in case of National Association of Software 
and Service Companies for A.Y. 2018- 19 – Reg.  
1. In this connection, it is stated while finalizing the assessment 
u/s 143(3), the FAO had denied exemption u/s 11 of  the I.T. Act 
and has also made some other addition on the account of interest 
income, donation, TDS etc. and assessed at a taxable income of 
Rs. 24,65,40,625/ -. 
2. The order of the FAO is a speaking order on each additions 
made by him/her. This order u/s 143(3) cannot be rectified u/s 
154 as the additions made are not mistakes apparent from the 
record
 .” 
4. It would appear that during the pendency of the appeal before 
CIT(A), NFAC, and without attending to the stay application which had 
been moved, the respon dents proceeded to adjust the demand that stood 
created by vir tue of the assessment order dated 29 April 2021 on 04 
March 2022, 07 March 2022 and 30 March 2022 against various 
refunds which were payable to the petitioner for AYs ’ 2010- 11, 2011 -
12 and 2020 -21. According to the writ petitioner it was entitled to 
receive the following  refunds for the aforenoted AYs:  
 AY 2010 -11  INR 2,27,44,597/ - 
AY 2011 -12   INR 30,3 9,000/ - 
AY 2020 -21   INR 9,14,63,710/ -   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 4 of 19 
 5. According to Mr. Kapoor, learned counsel who appeared in 
support of the writ petition, the action so initiated and the adjustments 
effected are wholly arbitrary and illegal in as much as there existed no justification for the adjustments being made without its application referable to Section 220(6) being either considered or examined.  
According to Mr. Kapoor , the very purpose of Section 220(6) has be en 
nullified by the action of the respondents who have proceeded to make 
the impugned adjustments without even examining the application of the petitioner for not being treated as an “ assessee in default”.  
6. Mr. Kapoor additionally submitted that as per the Central Board 
of Direct Taxes Office Memorandum No. 404/72/93 -ITCC
6
7. Appear ing for the respondents , Mr. Maratha, learned counsel 
submitted that they were clearly justified in effecting the adjustments in 
the absence of a declaration having been rendered in favour of the 
petitioner that it was not an “ assessee in default”. Learned  counsel 
submitted that although an application under Section 154 of the Act had 
been moved, the issues which were sought to be canvassed  thereon 
clearly did not qualify  as an error apparent and thus the same rightly 
came to be rejected.   dated 31 
July 2017, the respondents could have at best required the petitioner to 
deposit 20%  of the outstanding demand. According to learned counsel,  
despite the aforesaid binding prescription,  the entire outstanding 
demand illegally created for AY 2018- 19 had been adjusted against the 
refunds which were due and payable to the petitioner.  
8. It was the submission of Mr. Maratha that the application for stay 
which was moved by the writ petitioner was not accompanied by any 
                                           
6 OM   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 5 of 19 
 challan evidencing deposit of monies against the demand for AY 2018-
19 which was outstanding . Thus, and according to learned counsel, 
since a pre -condition as  specified in the  OM was not adhered to,  the 
application of the assessee was rightly not considered.    
9. Having noticed the rival submissions, we at the outset deem  it 
appropriate to extract the OM dated 31 July 2017 which reads as under:  
“OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC]  
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME -TAX ACT, 1961 - 
COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX -  WHEN  
TAX PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC], DATED 
31-7-2017  
 
Instruction No. 1914 dated 21- 3-1996 contains guidelines issued 
by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of 
outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of 
demand.  
Vide O.M. NO.404/72/93- ITCC dated 29- 2-2016 . revised 
guidelines were issued in partial modification of  Instruction No 
1914, wherein, inter alia, vide para 4(A) it had been laid  down 
that in a case where the outstanding  demand is disputed before 
CIT(A) , the Assessing Officer shall grant stay of demand till 
disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed 
demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B ) 
there under  Similar references to the standard rate of 15% have 
also been made in succeeding paragraphs therein . 
The matter has been reviewed by the Board in the light of 
feedback received from field authorities. In view of the  Board's 
efforts to contain over pitched assessments through several 
measures resulting in fairer and more reasonable assessment 
orders, the standard rate of 15% of the disputed demand is found 
to be on the lower side. Accordingly, it has been decided that the 
standard rate prescrib ed in O.M. dated 29- 2-2016 be revised to 
20% of  the disputed demand, where the demand is contested 
before CIT(A). Thus, all references to 15% of the disputed    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 6 of 19 
 demand in the aforesaid O.M dated 29- 2-2016 hereby stand 
modified to 20% of the disputed demand. Other guidelines 
contained in the O.M. dated 29- 2-2016 shall remain unchanged
These modifications may be immediately brought to the notice of 
all officers working in your jurisdiction for  proper compliance.”  . 
 
10. It would also be beneficial at this juncture to notice the earlier

SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME -TAX ACT, 1961 - 
COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX -  WHEN TAX 
PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN 
DEFAULT  - AMENDMENT OF INSTRUCTION NO.1914, 
DATED 21 -3-1996 TO PROVIDE FOR GUIDELINES FOR 
STAY OF DEMAND AT FIRST APPEAL STAGE  
 
OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93- ITCC], DATED 
29-2-2016  
 
Instruction No. 1914 dated 21- 3-1996 contains guidelines issued 
by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of 
outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of 
demand.  
 2. In part 'C' of the Instruction, it has been prescribed that a 
demand will be stayed only if there are valid reasons for doing so and that mere filing of an appeal against the assessment order will 
not be a sufficient reason to stay the recovery of demand. It has been further prescribed that while granting stay, the field officers may require the assessee to offer a suitable security (bank 
guarantee, etc.) and/ or require the assessee to pay a reasonable amount in lump sum or in instalments.   3. It has been reported that the field authorities often insist on 
payment of a very high proportion of the disputed demand before granting stay  of the balance demand. This often results in 
hardship for the taxpayers seeking stay of demand.   4. In order to streamline the process of grant of stay and 
standardize the quantum of lump sum payment required to be made by the assessee as a pre- condition for stay of demand 
disputed before CIT (A), the following modified guidelines are being issued in partial modification of Instruction No. 1914:    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 7 of 19 
  
(A) In a case where the outstanding demand is disputed 
before CIT (A), the assessing officer shall grant stay  of 
demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the 
disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category 
discussed in para (B) hereunder
 .  
(B) In a situation where,  
(a) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of 
addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that 
payment of a lump sum amount higher than 15% is 
warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same 
issue has been confirmed by appellate authorities in 
earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or 
jurisd ictional High Court is in favour of Revenue or 
addition is based on credible evidence collected in a 
search or survey operation, etc.) or
 ,  
(b) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of 
addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that 
payment of a lump sum amount lower than 15% is 
warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same 
issue has been deleted by appellate authorities in earlier 
years or the decision of the Supreme Court or 
jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the asses see, 
etc.), the assessing officer shall refer the matter to the 
administrative Pr. CIT/CIT, who after considering all 
relevant facts shall decide the quantum/proportion of 
demand to be paid by the assessee as lump sum payment 
for granting a stay of the bal ance demand
 .  
(C) In a case where stay of demand is granted by the 
assessing officer on payment of 15% of the disputed demand 
and the assessee is still aggrieved, he may approach the 
jurisdictional administrative Pr. CIT/CIT for a review of the 
decision of the assessing officer
 . 
(D) The assessing officer shall dispose of a stay petition 
within 2 weeks of filing of the petition. If a reference has been made to Pr. CIT/CIT under para 4 (B) above or a review petition has been filed by the assessee under para  4 (C) 
above, the same shall also be disposed of by the Pr. CIT/CIT within 2 weeks of the assessing officer making such reference or the assessee filing such review, as the case may be.     
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 8 of 19 
 (E) In granting stay, the Assessing Officer may impose such 
conditions as he may think fit. He may, inter alia, -  
 
(i) require an undertaking from the assessee that he will cooperate in the early disposal of appeal failing which the stay order will be cancelled;  
 (ii) reserve the right to review the order passed after expiry of reasonable period (say 6 months) or if the 
assessee has not co -operated in the early disposal of 
appeal, or where a subsequent pronouncement by a higher appellate authority or court alters the above situations;  
 (iii) reserve the right to adjust re funds arising, if any, 
against the demand, to the extent of the amount required for granting stay and subject to the provisions of section 245.   
5. These instructions/guidelines may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your juri sdiction for proper 
compliance. ” 
 
11. In our considered opinion , the respondents have proceeded on a 
wholly incorrect and untenable premise that the assessee was obliged to 
tender or place evidence of having deposited 20% of the dis puted 
demand before its appl ication for stay under Section 220(6)  of the Act  
could have been considered. The interpretation which is sought to be 
accorded to the aforesaid OM is clearly misconceived for the following 
reasons.  
12. It must at the outset be noted that the two OMs’ noticed a bove 
neither prescribe nor mandate 15% or 20% of the outstanding demand 
as the case may be,  being deposited as a pre -condition for grant of stay. 
The OM dated 29 February 2016 specifically spoke of a discretion 
vesting in the AO to grant stay subject to a deposit at a rate higher or 
lower than 15% dependent upon the facts of a particular case. The 
subsequent OM merely amended the rate to be 20%. In fact, while the   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 9 of 19 
 subsequent OM chose to describe the 20% deposit to be the “ standard 
rate”, the same would clea rly not sustain in light of the discussion 
which ensues.  
13. We note that while dealing with an identical question , we had in 
Avant ha Realty  Ltd. vs The Principal Commissioner of Income Tax 
Central Delhi 2 & Anr.7
“2. We note that the impu gned orders are principally based on the 
instructions of the Central Board of Direct Tax  [“CBDT ”] as 
encapsulated in the Office Memorandum  dated 31 July 2017 and 
which had while dealing with the manner in which the power 
under Section 220(6) of the Act is liable to be exercised had held that assessees’ may be accorded interim protection subject to deposit of 20% of the total outstanding demand failing which they would be treated as an “assessee in default ”.    observed as under:  
3. Insofar as the aforesaid Office Memorandum is concerned, 
suffice it to note that while considering its ambit the Supreme Court in Princip al Commissioner of Income Tax and Others 
vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited had held as follows: - 
“1. Delay condoned. Leave Granted.  
 2. Having heard Shri Vikr amjit Banerjee, learned ASG 
appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi- judicial authority, we 
only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will 
be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal.  
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending 
application, if any, shall stand disposed of.”  
 
14. As is manifest from the order passed by the Supreme Court in 
Principal Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. vs  LG Electronics

W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 10 of 19 
 India Pvt. Ltd.8, it had been emphasized that the administrative 
circular would not operate as a f etter upon the power other wise 
conferred on a quasi-judicial authority and that it would be wholly 
incorrect to view the OM as mandating the deposit of 20% , irrespective 
of the facts of an individual case.  This would also flow from the clear 
and express la nguage employed in sub -section (6) of Section 220 which 
speaks of the Assessing Officer9
15. The issue of a grant of stay pending appellate remedies be ing 
pursued arose for the consideration of a Division Bench of th e Court in  
Dabur India Limited vs Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) & 
Anr. being empowered “ in his discretion 
and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to impose in the 
circumstances of the case ”.  The discretion thus vested in the hands of 
the AO is one which cannot possibly be viewed as being cabine d by the 
terms of the O M.  
10
“6. , where it was pertinently observed as under:  
Having heard learned counsel for the parties and 
having perused the two Office Memorandums, in 
question, this Court is of the view that the requirement 
of payment of tw enty percent of disputed tax demand is 
not a pre -requisite for putting in abeyance recovery of 
demand pending first appeal in all cases. The said pre -
condition of deposit of twenty percent of the demand 
can be relaxed in appropriate cases. Even the Office 
Memorandum dated 29 February, 2016 gives instances 
like where addition on the same issue has been deleted 
by the appellate authorities in earlier years or where the 
decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High 
Court is in favour of the assessee

8. In the present case, the impugned order is non-
reasoned. The three basic principles i.e. the prima facie 
case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury have 
not been considered while deciding the stay 
application
 .” 
16. More recently  in Indian National Congress vs Deputy 
Commissioner of Income Tax Central –  19 & Ors.11
“22. However, as we read the order impugned, the matter does not 
appear to have proceeded along those lines before the ITAT. The 
tone and tenor of submissions clearly appear to have been concentrated upon the merits of the assessment order.  we had an 
occasion to examine the scope of the power conferred by Section 
220(6) of the Act and which was explained in the following terms:  
Although 
the issue of payment of 20% of the outstanding demand appears 
to have been raised, the same came to be summarily rejected by 
the ITAT in cryptic terms. Notwithstanding the above, it becomes 
pertinent to observe that the 20% deposit which is spoken of in 
the OM dated 31 July 2017 is not liable to be viewed as a 
condition etched in stone or one which is inviolable. The OM 
merely seeks to provide guidance to the authorities to bear in 
mind certain aspects while considering applications for stay of 
demand pending an appeals remedy being pursued. The OM is 
not liable to be read as conferring an indefeasible right upon the 
assessee to claim a stay of a tax liability by merely offering or 
consenting to deposit 20% of the outstanding liability. Ultimately, 
it is for the authorities to examine and con sider what amount 
would be sufficient to securitise the interest of the Revenue and 
thus a just balance being struck. The quantum of the deposit tha t 
would be required to be made would ultimately depend upon the 
facts and circumstances of each case
“1. Delay condoned. Leave granted.  . This i s evident from the 
order of the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of 
Income Tax and others Vs. LG Electronics India Private 
Limited and which is extracted hereunder: -

11 Neutral Citation –  2024:DHC:2016- DB Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learn ed ASG 
appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence 
to the fact that he has argued before us that the   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 12 of 19 
 administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the 
Commissioner since it is a quasi- judicial authority, we 
only need to clarify that  in all cases like the present, it will 
be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, 
to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, 
pending appeal
 . 
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending 
application, if any, shall stand disposed of.”  
 
23. The position which thus emerges is that while 20% is not 
liable to be viewed as an entrenched or inflexible rule, there could 
be circumstances where the respondents may be justified in 
seeking a deposit in excess of the above dependent upon the facts 
and circumstances that may obtain. This would have to 
necessarily be left to the sound exercise of discretion by the 
respondents based upon a consideration of issues such as prima 
facie, financial hardship and the likelihood of success. This 
observation we render being conscious of the indisputable 
position that the OM applies only upto the stage of the appeal 
pending before the CIT(A) and being of little significance when it 
comes to the ITAT
 .”  
17. As explained in Indian National Congress , the 20% which is 
spoken of in the OM cannot possibly be viewed as being an inviolate o r 
inflexible condition. The extent of the deposit which an assessee may 
be called upon to make would have to be examined and answered 
bearing in mind factors such as prima fac ie case, undue hardship and 
likelihood of success. We note that while dealing with the question of 
the claim of stay as made by an assessee and the competing obligation 
to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Supreme Court in Benara 
Valves Ltd. & Ors. Vs Commissioner of Central Excise & Anr.12
“6. Principles relating to grant of stay pending disposal of the 
matters before the forums concerned have been considered in  
had elucidated the legal position in the following words : 
                                           
12 (2006) 1 3 SCC 347    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 13 of 19 
 several cases. It is to be noted that in such matters though 
discretion is available, the same has to be exercised judicially.  
7. The applicable principles have been set out succinctly 
in Silliguri Municipality v. Amalendu Das  and Samarias Trading 
Co. (P) Ltd. v. S. Samuel  and CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd.  
8. It is true that on merely establishing a prima facie case, interim 
order of p rotection should not be passed. But if on a cursory 
glance it appears that the demand raised has no leg to stand  on, it 
would be undesirable to require the assessee to pay full or 
substantive part of the demand. Petitions for stay should not be 
disposed of  in a routine matter unmindful of the consequences 
flowing from the order requiring the assessee to deposit full or 
part of the demand. There can be no rule of universal application 
in such matters and the order has to be passed keeping in view the 
factual  scenario involved. Merely because this Court has indicated 
the principles that does not give a license to the forum/authority 
to pass an order which cannot be sustained on the touchstone of 
fairness, legality and public interest. Where denial of interim 
relief may lead to public mischief, grave irreparable private injury  
or shake a citizen ’s faith in the impartiality of public 
administration, interim relief can be given
9. It has become an unfortunate trend to casually dispose of stay 
applications by refe rring to decisions in Siliguri Municipality  and 
Dunlop India cases without analysing factual scenario involved in 
a particular case.  . 
xxxx   xxxx    xxxx 
11. Two significant expressions used in the provisions are ""undue 
hardship to such person"" and ""safegua rd the interests of 
Revenue "". Therefore, while dealing with the application twin 
requirements of considerations i.e. consideration of undue 
hardship aspect and imposition of conditions to safeguard the 
interest of Revenue have to be kept in view
12. As no ted above there are two important expressions in . 
Section 
35-F. One is undue hardship. This is a matter within the special 
knowledge of the applicant for waiver and has to be established by him. A mere  assertion about undue hardship would not be 
sufficient. It was noted by this Court in S. Vasudeva v. State of Karnataka that under  Indian conditions expression ""undue 
hardship"" is normally related to e conomic hardship. 
""Undue"" 
which means  something which is not merited by the conduct of 
the claimant, or is very much disproportionate to it. Undue 
hardship is caused when the hardship is not warranted by the 
circumstances.    
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 14 of 19 
 13. For a hardship to be 'undue' it must be shown that the 
particular burden to observe or perform the requirement is out of 
proportion to the nature of the requirement itself, and the benefit 
which the applicant would derive from compliance with it.  
14. The word ""undue"" adds something more than just hardship. It 
means an excessive hardship or a hardship greater than the 
circumstances warrant
15. . 
The other aspect relates to imposition of condition to 
safeguard the interest of Revenue . This is an aspect which the 
Tribunal has to bring into focus. It is for the Tribunal to impose 
such conditions as are deemed proper to safeguard the interest s of 
the Revenue . Therefore, the Tribunal while dealing with the 
application has to consider materials to be placed by the assessee 
relating to undue har dship and also to stipulate condition as 
required to safeguard the interest of the Revenue
 .” 
The aforesaid principles were reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in 
Monotosh Saha vs Special Director, Enforcement Directorate & 
Anr.13
18. We find a lucid explanation of  the legal position with respect to 
pre-deposit and the grant of stay  in a decision rendered by a Division  
Bench of the Allahabad High Court in ITC Ltd v. Commissioner 
(Appeals), Customs & Central Excise 
14
“18. In Income- tax Officer  v. M.K. Mohammad Kunhi , AIR 1969 
SC 430, the Apex Court held that stay should be granted if a 
strong  prima facie case  has been made out and in the most 
deserving and appropriate cases where entire purpose of the 
appeal will be frustrated or re ndered nugatory by allowing the 
recovery proceedings to continue, during the pendency of the 
appeal.   where the Court had held as

21. In Mehsana District Cooperative Milk P.U. Ltd. v. Union of 
India, 2003 (154) E.L.T. 347 (S.C.), the Hon'ble Supreme Court 
considered the case of dispensation of pre -deposit condition and 
held that the Appellate Authority must address to itself to the 
prima  facie  merits of the appellant's case and upon being satisfied 
of the same, determine the quantum of deposit taking int o 
consideration the financial hardship and other such related factors
xxxx   xxxx   xxxx . 
 23. 
In J.N. Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. CEGAT , 1991 (53) E.L.T. 543, 
the Calcutta High Court while considering the provisions of pre -
deposit of duty and penalty, observed that where the authority 
concerned comes to the conclusion that the appellant has a 
good prima facie case  so as to justify the dispensation of 
requirement of pre -deposit of the disputed amount on duty and 
penalty, the authority must exercise its discretio n to dispense with 
such requirement particularly in a case where the appellant 
satisfies the authority concerned that its case is squarely covered 
by the decision of a competent Court binding on it. In such an 
eventuality, asking the appellant to deposit t he duty demanded 
and penalty levied would undoubtedly cause undue hardship to 
the appellant. While deciding the said case, Calcutta High Court 
placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court 
in L. Hirday Narain v. Income -Tax Officer, Bareilly , (1970) 2 
SCC 355 : AIR 1971 SC 33, wherein the Court observed as 
under
“If a statute invests a public officer with authority to do an act in a specified set of circumstances, it is imperative upon him to exercise his authority in a manner appropriate to t he 
case when a party interested and having a right to apply moved in that behalf and circumstances for exercise of authority are shown to exist. Even if the words used in the statute  prima facie  enabling, the courts will readily infer a 
duty to exercise po wer which is invested in aid of 
enforcement of a right -public or private -of a citizen.”  : 
 24. 
Thus, even where enabling or discretionary power is conferred 
on a public authority, the words which are permissive in 
character, require to be constituted, involving a duty to exercise 
that power, if some legal right or entitlement is conferred or 
enjoyed, and for the effectuating the such right or entitlement, the 
exercise of such power is essential. The aforesaid view stands   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 16 of 19 
 fortified in view of that fact that ev ery power is coupled with a 
duty to act reasonably and the Court/Tribunal/Authority has to 
proceed having strict adherence to the provisions of law.

Central Excise (A) , 1994 (69) E.L.T. 193 (Cal.), the Calcutta High 
Court, while examining a similar issue and placed reliance upon a large number of judgments  and held that the phrase “undue 
hardship” would cover a case where the appellant has a strong  prima facie case . The phrase also covers a situation where 
there is an arguable case in the appeal. If the Appellate Authority forms the opinion that appellant has a strong  prima facie case , it 
should dispense with the pre -deposit condition altogether. 
However, where it is of the opinion that the appellant has no 
arguable case, the Appellate Authority must safeguard the interest 
of the Revenue, as the same also cannot be jeopardised.  27
. In Sri Krishna v. Union of India, 1998 (104) E.L.T. 305, 
Delhi High Court considered the issue of dispensation of pre -
deposit condition and the concept of undue hardship while 
considering the provisions of Section 129E of the Cust oms Act, 
1962 and Section 35 of the Act and held that the Court while 
considering the case of the appellant should examine as to 
whether the Appellate Authority or Tribunal have dealt with the 
plea raised by the appellant before it and have considered as t o 
whether the appellant has a prima facie case  on merit. In case the 
appellant has a strong  prima facie case , as is most likely to 
exonerate him from liability and the Appellate Authority/Tribunal 
insists on the deposit of the amount, it would amount to undue 
hardship
 . 
28. In Hoogly Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 
637, the Calcutta High Court again reiterated the view that if the appellant has a strong  prima facie case , he is entitled of waiving 
the pre -deposit condition and in case the  Appellate Authority 
insists to deposit the amount so assessed or penalty so levied, it will cause undue hardship to the assessee. While considering the said case, the Court placed reliance upon the large number of   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 17 of 19 
 judgments including  Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner

Fertilizer  v. Union of India, 1985 (22) E.L.T. 301 (All.);  Re.

Sea Foods  v. Collector of Customs , 1989 (42) E.L.T. 220 (Ker.), 
wherein the Courts had expressed the similar view.  29. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs 
(Appeals) ILR 2000 KAR 25, while examining the issue of pre -
deposit under Section 35 of the Act, after considering a large number  of judgments of the Apex Court and various High Courts, 
it was held as under:  
“
While considering the case of ‘undue hardship’, the 
authority is required to examine the  prima facie  on merits 
of the dispute as well. Pleading of financial disability 
would not be the only consideration. Where the case is 
fully covered in favour of the assessee by a biding 
precedent like that of the judgment of the Supreme Court, 
jurisdictional High Court or a Special Bench of the 
Tribunal, then to still insist upon the deposit  of duty and 
penalty levied would certainly cause undue hardship to the 
assessee. Absence of the financial hardship in such a case 
would be no ground to decline the dispensation of pre -
deposit under the proviso to Section 35F. The power to 
dispense with such deposit is conferred under the 
authorities has to be exercised precisely in cases like this 
type and if it is not exercised under such circumstances 
then this Court will require it to be exercised. Such like 
cases where two views are not possible then t he condition 
of pre -deposit before the appeal is heard on merits, can be 
dispensed with. In case two views are possible on 
interpretation, based on conflicting judgments of the 
Tribunal or different High Courts in the absence of the 
judgment of the jurisdi ctional High Court then the 
authorities may pass the order under proviso to Section 
35F of the Act keeping in view the facts of the case in 
hand
xxxx   xxxx   xxxx .” 
 35. 
In view of the above, the aforesaid authorities make it clear 
that the Court should not grant interim relief/stay of the recovery 
merely by asking of a party. It has to maintain a balance between 
the rights of an individual and the State so far as the recovery of 
sovereign dues is concerned. While considering the application 
for stay/waive r of a pre -deposit, as required under the law, the 
Court must apply its mind as to whether the appellant has a   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 18 of 19 
 strong  prima facie case on merit. In case it is covered by the 
judgment of a Court/Tribunal binding upon the Appellate 
Authority, it should apply  its mind as to whether in view of the 
said judgment, the appellant is likely to succeed on merit. If an 
appellant having strong  prima facie case , is asked to deposit the 
amount of assessment so made or penalty so levied, it would 
cause undue hardship to him, though there may be no financial 
restrain on the appellant running in a good financial condition . 
The arguments that appellant is in a position to deposit or if he 
succeeds in appeal, he will be entitled to get the refund, are not the considerations fo r deciding the application. The order of the 
Appellate Authority itself must show that it had applied its mind to the issue raised by the appellant and it has been considered in accordance with the law
. The expression “undue hardship” has a 
wider connotati on as it takes within its ambit the case where the 
assessee is asked to deposit the amount even if he is likely to 
exonerate from the total liability on disposal of his appeal. 
Dispensation of deposit should also be allowed where two views 
are possible. While considering the application for interim relief, 
the Court must examine all pros and cons involved in the case and 
further examine that in case recovery is not stayed, the right of 
appeal conferred by the legislature and refusal to exercise the 
discreti onary power by the authority to stay/waive the predeposit 
condition, would be reduced to nugatory/illusory. Undoubtedly, 
the interest of the Revenue cannot be jeopardized but that does 
not mean that in order to protect the interest of the Revenue, the 
Cour t or authority should exercise its duty under the law to take 
into consideration the rights and interest of an in dividual. It is 
also clear that before any goods could be subjected to duty, it has 
to be established that it has been manufactured and it is 
marketable and to prove that it is marketable, the burden is on the 
Revenue and not on the manufacturer
 .” 
19. Though some of the decisions noticed by us hereinabove 
pertained to pre -deposit prescriptions placed by  a statute , the principles 
enunciated therein would clearly be of relevance while examining the 
extent of the power that stands placed in the hands of the AO in terms of Section 220(6)  of the Act . In our considered opinion , the respondents 
have clearly erred in proceeding on the assumption that the ap plication 
for consideration of outstanding demands being placed in abeyance could not have even been entertained without a 20% pre -deposit. The   
  
W.P.(C) 9310/2022              Page 19 of 19 
 aforesaid stand as taken is thoroughly misconceived and wholly 
untenable in law.  
20. Undisputedly , and on the date when the impugned adjustments 
came to be made , the application moved by the petitioner referable to 
Section 220(6) of the Act had neither been considered nor disposed of . 
The respondents have thus in our considered opinion clearly acted 
arbitrarily in proc eeding to adjust the demand for AY 2018 -19 against 
available refunds without attending to th at application.  This action of 
the respondents is wholly arbitrary and unfair. The intimation of 
adjustments being proposed would hardly be of any relevance or 
consequence once it is found that the application for stay remained 
pending and the said fact is not an issue of contestation.  21. We consequently allow the instant writ petition and remit the 
matter to the respondents for considering the application of the 
petitioner under Section 220(6) in accordance with the observations 
made hereinabove. The issue of the amount of refund liable to be 
released shall abide by the decision which the respondents shall now take pursuant to the directions framed hereinabove.

1. The writ petitioner has approached this Court aggrieved by the adjustment of a disputed tax demand pertaining to Assessment Year1 2018-19 against refunds which were due to it for AYs 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2020-21. The challenge is principally raised in the backdrop of the aforesaid adjustment having been made despite the petitioner having moved a rectification application pertaining to the final assessment which was framed for AY 2018-19 and an admitted failure on the part of the respondents to consider and dispose of the stay application which was moved and was referable to Section 220(6) of the Income Tax Act, 19612.  It is in the aforesaid backdrop that the petitioner has prayed for the refund being processed after adjustment of 20% of the disputed demand for AY 2018-19. For the purposes of examining the reliefs which are claimed, we deem it apposite to notice the following facts.
2. The petitioner filed its Return of Income3 for AY 2018-19 on 29 September 2018 claiming a refund of INR 6,45,65,160/- on account of excess Taxes Deducted at Source4 which was deducted during the course of the said year.  In the course of processing of that ROI, notices under Section 143(2) and 142(1) of the Act came to be issued on 22 September 2019 and 09 January 2020 respectively. On 16 November 2019, the petitioner received an intimation, referable to Section 143(1) of the Act, apprising it of an amount of INR 6,42,30,413/- being refundable along with interest. However, when the assessment was ultimately framed and a formal order was passed under Section 143(3) read with Section 144B of the Act, various additions came to be made to the income disclosed in the ROI and leading to the creation of a demand of INR 10,26,85,633/-.
3. Aggrieved by the aforesaid, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax(Appeals), National Faceless Appeal Centre5, which is stated to be pending.  Simultaneously, it also moved an application purporting to be under Section 154 of the Act for correction of rectifiable mistakes which according to it were apparent on the face of the record. Along with the rectification application, the petitioner on 28 May 2021 also filed a stay application in respect of the demand so raised. The rectification application however came to be perfunctorily rejected in terms of an order dated 07 June 2021 which is reproduced hereinbelow:
Sub: Rectification in case of National Association of Software and Service Companies for A.Y. 2018-19  Reg.
1. In this connection, it is stated while finalizing the assessment u/s 143(3), the FAO had denied exemption u/s 11 of the I.T. Act and has also made some other addition on the account of interest income, donation, TDS etc. and assessed at a taxable income of Rs. 24,65,40,625/-.
2. The order of the FAO is a speaking order on each additions made by him/her. This order u/s 143(3) cannot be rectified u/s 154 as the additions made are not mistakes apparent from the record.

4. It would appear that during the pendency of the appeal before CIT(A), NFAC, and without attending to the stay application which had been moved, the respondents proceeded to adjust the demand that stood created by virtue of the assessment order dated 29 April 2021 on 04 March 2022, 07 March 2022 and 30 March 2022 against various refunds which were payable to the petitioner for AYs 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2020-21. According to the writ petitioner it was entitled to receive the following refunds for the aforenoted AYs:
 AY 2010-11		INR 2,27,44,597/-
     AY 2011-12			INR 30,39,000/-
     AY 2020-21			INR 9,14,63,710/-
5. According to Mr. Kapoor, learned counsel who appeared in support of the writ petition, the action so initiated and the adjustments effected are wholly arbitrary and illegal in as much as there existed no justification for the adjustments being made without its application referable to Section 220(6) being either considered or examined.  According to Mr. Kapoor, the very purpose of Section 220(6) has been nullified by the action of the respondents who have proceeded to make the impugned adjustments without even examining the application of the petitioner for not being treated as an assessee in default. 
6. Mr. Kapoor additionally submitted that as per the Central Board of Direct Taxes Office Memorandum No. 404/72/93-ITCC6 dated 31 July 2017, the respondents could have at best required the petitioner to deposit 20% of the outstanding demand. According to learned counsel, despite the aforesaid binding prescription, the entire outstanding demand illegally created for AY 2018-19 had been adjusted against the refunds which were due and payable to the petitioner. 
7. Appearing for the respondents, Mr. Maratha, learned counsel submitted that they were clearly justified in effecting the adjustments in the absence of a declaration having been rendered in favour of the petitioner that it was not an assessee in default. Learned counsel submitted that although an application under Section 154 of the Act had been moved, the issues which were sought to be canvassed thereon clearly did not qualify as an error apparent and thus the same rightly came to be rejected. 
8. It was the submission of Mr. Maratha that the application for stay which was moved by the writ petitioner was not accompanied by any challan evidencing deposit of monies against the demand for AY 2018-19 which was outstanding. Thus, and according to learned counsel, since a pre-condition as specified in the OM was not adhered to, the application of the assessee was rightly not considered.  
9. Having noticed the rival submissions, we at the outset deem it appropriate to extract the OM dated 31 July 2017 which reads as under:
OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC]
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX - WHEN
TAX PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN DEFAULT - RECOVERY OF OUTSTANDING
TAX DEMANDS - PARTIAL MODIFICATION OF INSTRUCTION N0.1914, DATED 21-3-1996 TO
PROVIDE FOR GUIDELINES FOR STAY OF DEMAND AT FIRST APPEAL STAGE

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC], DATED 31-7-2017

Instruction No. 1914 dated 21-3-1996 contains guidelines issued by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of demand.
Vide O.M. NO.404/72/93-ITCC dated 29-2-2016. revised guidelines were issued in partial modification of Instruction No 1914, wherein, inter alia, vide para 4(A) it had been laid down that in a case where the outstanding demand is disputed before CIT(A), the Assessing Officer shall grant stay of demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B) there under Similar references to the standard rate of 15% have also been made in succeeding paragraphs therein.
The matter has been reviewed by the Board in the light of feedback received from field authorities. In view of the Board's efforts to contain over pitched assessments through several measures resulting in fairer and more reasonable assessment orders, the standard rate of 15% of the disputed demand is found to be on the lower side. Accordingly, it has been decided that the standard rate prescribed in O.M. dated 29-2-2016 be revised to 20% of the disputed demand, where the demand is contested before CIT(A). Thus, all references to 15% of the disputed demand in the aforesaid O.M dated 29-2-2016 hereby stand modified to 20% of the disputed demand. Other guidelines contained in the O.M. dated 29-2-2016 shall remain unchanged.
These modifications may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your jurisdiction for proper compliance.

10. It would also be beneficial at this juncture to notice the earlier OM dated 29 February 2016 and the same is reproduced hereinbelow:-

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC]
SECTION 220 OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961 - COLLECTION AND RECOVERY OF TAX - WHEN TAX PAYABLE AND WHEN ASSESSEE DEEMED IN DEFAULT - AMENDMENT OF INSTRUCTION NO.1914, DATED 21-3-1996 TO PROVIDE FOR GUIDELINES FOR STAY OF DEMAND AT FIRST APPEAL STAGE 

OFFICE MEMORANDUM [F.NO.404/72/93-ITCC], DATED 29-2-2016

Instruction No. 1914 dated 21-3-1996 contains guidelines issued by the Board regarding procedure to be followed for recovery of outstanding demand, including procedure for grant of stay of demand. 

2. In part 'C' of the Instruction, it has been prescribed that a demand will be stayed only if there are valid reasons for doing so and that mere filing of an appeal against the assessment order will not be a sufficient reason to stay the recovery of demand. It has been further prescribed that while granting stay, the field officers may require the assessee to offer a suitable security (bank guarantee, etc.) and/ or require the assessee to pay a reasonable amount in lump sum or in instalments. 

3. It has been reported that the field authorities often insist on payment of a very high proportion of the disputed demand before granting stay of the balance demand. This often results in hardship for the taxpayers seeking stay of demand. 

4. In order to streamline the process of grant of stay and standardize the quantum of lump sum payment required to be made by the assessee as a pre-condition for stay of demand disputed before CIT (A), the following modified guidelines are being issued in partial modification of Instruction No. 1914: 

(A) In a case where the outstanding demand is disputed before CIT (A), the assessing officer shall grant stay of demand till disposal of first appeal on payment of 15% of the disputed demand, unless the case falls in the category discussed in para (B) hereunder. 

    (B) In a situation where, 
(a) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that payment of a lump sum amount higher than 15% is warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same issue has been confirmed by appellate authorities in earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of Revenue or addition is based on credible evidence collected in a search or survey operation, etc.) or, 

(b) the assessing officer is of the view that the nature of addition resulting in the disputed demand is such that payment of a lump sum amount lower than 15% is warranted (e.g. in a case where addition on the same issue has been deleted by appellate authorities in earlier years or the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the assessee, etc.), the assessing officer shall refer the matter to the administrative Pr. CIT/CIT, who after considering all relevant facts shall decide the quantum/proportion of demand to be paid by the assessee as lump sum payment for granting a stay of the balance demand. 

(C) In a case where stay of demand is granted by the assessing officer on payment of 15% of the disputed demand and the assessee is still aggrieved, he may approach the jurisdictional administrative Pr. CIT/CIT for a review of the decision of the assessing officer.

(D) The assessing officer shall dispose of a stay petition within 2 weeks of filing of the petition. If a reference has been made to Pr. CIT/CIT under para 4 (B) above or a review petition has been filed by the assessee under para 4 (C) above, the same shall also be disposed of by the Pr. CIT/CIT within 2 weeks of the assessing officer making such reference or the assessee filing such review, as the case may be. 

(E) In granting stay, the Assessing Officer may impose such conditions as he may think fit. He may, inter alia,- 

(i) require an undertaking from the assessee that he will cooperate in the early disposal of appeal failing which the stay order will be cancelled; 

(ii) reserve the right to review the order passed after expiry of reasonable period (say 6 months) or if the assessee has not co-operated in the early disposal of appeal, or where a subsequent pronouncement by a higher appellate authority or court alters the above situations; 

(iii) reserve the right to adjust refunds arising, if any, against the demand, to the extent of the amount required for granting stay and subject to the provisions of section 245. 

5. These instructions/guidelines may be immediately brought to the notice of all officers working in your jurisdiction for proper compliance.

11. In our considered opinion, the respondents have proceeded on a wholly incorrect and untenable premise that the assessee was obliged to tender or place evidence of having deposited 20% of the disputed demand before its application for stay under Section 220(6) of the Act could have been considered. The interpretation which is sought to be accorded to the aforesaid OM is clearly misconceived for the following reasons.
12. It must at the outset be noted that the two OMs noticed above neither prescribe nor mandate 15% or 20% of the outstanding demand as the case may be, being deposited as a pre-condition for grant of stay. The OM dated 29 February 2016 specifically spoke of a discretion vesting in the AO to grant stay subject to a deposit at a rate higher or lower than 15% dependent upon the facts of a particular case. The subsequent OM merely amended the rate to be 20%. In fact, while the subsequent OM chose to describe the 20% deposit to be the standard rate, the same would clearly not sustain in light of the discussion which ensues. 
13. We note that while dealing with an identical question, we had in Avantha Realty Ltd. vs The Principal Commissioner of Income Tax Central Delhi 2 & Anr.7  observed as under:
2. We note that the impugned orders are principally based on the instructions of the Central Board of Direct Tax [CBDT] as encapsulated in the Office Memorandum dated 31 July 2017 and which had while dealing with the manner in which the power under Section 220(6) of the Act is liable to be exercised had held that assessees may be accorded interim protection subject to deposit of 20% of the total outstanding demand failing which they would be treated as an assessee in default. 
3. Insofar as the aforesaid Office Memorandum is concerned, suffice it to note that while considering its ambit the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and Others vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited had held as follows:-
1. Delay condoned. Leave Granted.
 2. Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi-judicial authority, we only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal. 
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of.

14. As is manifest from the order passed by the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors. vs LG Electronics India Pvt. Ltd.8, it had been emphasized that the administrative circular would not operate as a fetter upon the power otherwise conferred on a quasi-judicial authority and that it would be wholly incorrect to view the OM as mandating the deposit of 20%, irrespective of the facts of an individual case. This would also flow from the clear and express language employed in sub-section (6) of Section 220 which speaks of the Assessing Officer9 being empowered in his discretion and subject to such conditions as he may think fit to impose in the circumstances of the case.  The discretion thus vested in the hands of the AO is one which cannot possibly be viewed as being cabined by the terms of the OM. 
15. The issue of a grant of stay pending appellate remedies being pursued arose for the consideration of a Division Bench of the Court in  Dabur India Limited vs Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) & Anr.10, where it was pertinently observed as under:
6. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the two Office Memorandums, in question, this Court is of the view that the requirement of payment of twenty percent of disputed tax demand is not a pre-requisite for putting in abeyance recovery of demand pending first appeal in all cases. The said pre-condition of deposit of twenty percent of the demand can be relaxed in appropriate cases. Even the Office Memorandum dated 29 February, 2016 gives instances like where addition on the same issue has been deleted by the appellate authorities in earlier years or where the decision of the Supreme Court or jurisdictional High Court is in favour of the assessee.

xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

8. In the present case, the impugned order is non-reasoned. The three basic principles i.e. the prima facie case, balance of convenience and irreparable injury have not been considered while deciding the stay application.

16. More recently in Indian National Congress vs Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Central  19 & Ors.11 we had an occasion to examine the scope of the power conferred by Section 220(6) of the Act and which was explained in the following terms:
22. However, as we read the order impugned, the matter does not appear to have proceeded along those lines before the ITAT. The tone and tenor of submissions clearly appear to have been concentrated upon the merits of the assessment order. Although the issue of payment of 20% of the outstanding demand appears to have been raised, the same came to be summarily rejected by the ITAT in cryptic terms. Notwithstanding the above, it becomes pertinent to observe that the 20% deposit which is spoken of in the OM dated 31 July 2017 is not liable to be viewed as a condition etched in stone or one which is inviolable. The OM merely seeks to provide guidance to the authorities to bear in mind certain aspects while considering applications for stay of demand pending an appeals remedy being pursued. The OM is not liable to be read as conferring an indefeasible right upon the assessee to claim a stay of a tax liability by merely offering or consenting to deposit 20% of the outstanding liability. Ultimately, it is for the authorities to examine and consider what amount would be sufficient to securitise the interest of the Revenue and thus a just balance being struck. The quantum of the deposit that would be required to be made would ultimately depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. This is evident from the order of the Supreme Court in Principal Commissioner of Income Tax and others Vs. LG Electronics India Private Limited and which is extracted hereunder: -
1. Delay condoned. Leave granted.

2. Having heard Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the appellant, and giving credence to the fact that he has argued before us that the administrative circular will not operate as a fetter on the Commissioner since it is a quasi-judicial authority, we only need to clarify that in all cases like the present, it will be open to the authorities, on the facts of individual cases, to grant deposit orders of a lesser amount than 20%, pending appeal.

3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly. Pending application, if any, shall stand disposed of.

23. The position which thus emerges is that while 20% is not liable to be viewed as an entrenched or inflexible rule, there could be circumstances where the respondents may be justified in seeking a deposit in excess of the above dependent upon the facts and circumstances that may obtain. This would have to necessarily be left to the sound exercise of discretion by the respondents based upon a consideration of issues such as prima facie, financial hardship and the likelihood of success. This observation we render being conscious of the indisputable position that the OM applies only upto the stage of the appeal pending before the CIT(A) and being of little significance when it comes to the ITAT. 

17. As explained in Indian National Congress, the 20% which is spoken of in the OM cannot possibly be viewed as being an inviolate or inflexible condition. The extent of the deposit which an assessee may be called upon to make would have to be examined and answered bearing in mind factors such as prima facie case, undue hardship and likelihood of success. We note that while dealing with the question of the claim of stay as made by an assessee and the competing obligation to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Supreme Court in Benara Valves Ltd. & Ors. Vs Commissioner of Central Excise & Anr.12 had elucidated the legal position in the following words:
6. Principles relating to grant of stay pending disposal of the matters before the forums concerned have been considered in several cases. It is to be noted that in such matters though discretion is available, the same has to be exercised judicially.
7. The applicable principles have been set out succinctly in Silliguri Municipality v. Amalendu Das and Samarias Trading Co. (P) Ltd. v. S. Samuel and CCE v. Dunlop India Ltd. 
8. It is true that on merely establishing a prima facie case, interim order of protection should not be passed. But if on a cursory glance it appears that the demand raised has no leg to stand on, it would be undesirable to require the assessee to pay full or substantive part of the demand. Petitions for stay should not be disposed of in a routine matter unmindful of the consequences flowing from the order requiring the assessee to deposit full or part of the demand. There can be no rule of universal application in such matters and the order has to be passed keeping in view the factual scenario involved. Merely because this Court has indicated the principles that does not give a license to the forum/authority to pass an order which cannot be sustained on the touchstone of fairness, legality and public interest. Where denial of interim relief may lead to public mischief, grave irreparable private injury or shake a citizens faith in the impartiality of public administration, interim relief can be given.
9. It has become an unfortunate trend to casually dispose of stay applications by referring to decisions in Siliguri Municipality and Dunlop India cases without analysing factual scenario involved in a particular case.
xxxx			xxxx				xxxx
11. Two significant expressions used in the provisions are ""undue hardship to such person"" and ""safeguard the interests of Revenue"". Therefore, while dealing with the application twin requirements of considerations i.e. consideration of undue hardship aspect and imposition of conditions to safeguard the interest of Revenue have to be kept in view.
12. As noted above there are two important expressions in Section 35-F. One is undue hardship. This is a matter within the special knowledge of the applicant for waiver and has to be established by him. A mere assertion about undue hardship would not be sufficient. It was noted by this Court in S. Vasudeva v. State of Karnataka that under Indian conditions expression ""undue hardship"" is normally related to economic hardship. ""Undue"" which means something which is not merited by the conduct of the claimant, or is very much disproportionate to it. Undue hardship is caused when the hardship is not warranted by the circumstances.
13. For a hardship to be 'undue' it must be shown that the particular burden to observe or perform the requirement is out of proportion to the nature of the requirement itself, and the benefit which the applicant would derive from compliance with it.
14. The word ""undue"" adds something more than just hardship. It means an excessive hardship or a hardship greater than the circumstances warrant.
15. The other aspect relates to imposition of condition to safeguard the interest of Revenue. This is an aspect which the Tribunal has to bring into focus. It is for the Tribunal to impose such conditions as are deemed proper to safeguard the interests of the Revenue. Therefore, the Tribunal while dealing with the application has to consider materials to be placed by the assessee relating to undue hardship and also to stipulate condition as required to safeguard the interest of the Revenue.

The aforesaid principles were reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in Monotosh Saha vs Special Director, Enforcement Directorate & Anr.13
18. We find a lucid explanation of the legal position with respect to pre-deposit and the grant of stay in a decision rendered by a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in ITC Ltd v. Commissioner (Appeals), Customs & Central Excise14 where the Court had held as follows:
18. In Income-tax Officer v. M.K. Mohammad Kunhi, AIR 1969 SC 430, the Apex Court held that stay should be granted if a strong prima facie case has been made out and in the most deserving and appropriate cases where entire purpose of the appeal will be frustrated or rendered nugatory by allowing the recovery proceedings to continue, during the pendency of the appeal.

19. In B.P.L. Sanyo Utilities and Appliances Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 621, the Karnataka High Court held that in the matter of grant of waiver of pre-deposit, each case has to be examined on its own merit and no hard and fast rule can be formulated.
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

21. In Mehsana District Cooperative Milk P.U. Ltd. v. Union of India, 2003 (154) E.L.T. 347 (S.C.), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the case of dispensation of pre-deposit condition and held that the Appellate Authority must address to itself to the prima facie merits of the appellant's case and upon being satisfied of the same, determine the quantum of deposit taking into consideration the financial hardship and other such related factors.
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

23. In J.N. Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. v. CEGAT, 1991 (53) E.L.T. 543, the Calcutta High Court while considering the provisions of pre-deposit of duty and penalty, observed that where the authority concerned comes to the conclusion that the appellant has a good prima facie case so as to justify the dispensation of requirement of pre-deposit of the disputed amount on duty and penalty, the authority must exercise its discretion to dispense with such requirement particularly in a case where the appellant satisfies the authority concerned that its case is squarely covered by the decision of a competent Court binding on it. In such an eventuality, asking the appellant to deposit the duty demanded and penalty levied would undoubtedly cause undue hardship to the appellant. While deciding the said case, Calcutta High Court placed reliance upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in L. Hirday Narain v. Income-Tax Officer, Bareilly, (1970) 2 SCC 355 : AIR 1971 SC 33, wherein the Court observed as under:
If a statute invests a public officer with authority to do an act in a specified set of circumstances, it is imperative upon him to exercise his authority in a manner appropriate to the case when a party interested and having a right to apply moved in that behalf and circumstances for exercise of authority are shown to exist. Even if the words used in the statute prima facie enabling, the courts will readily infer a duty to exercise power which is invested in aid of enforcement of a right-public or private-of a citizen.

24. Thus, even where enabling or discretionary power is conferred on a public authority, the words which are permissive in character, require to be constituted, involving a duty to exercise that power, if some legal right or entitlement is conferred or enjoyed, and for the effectuating the such right or entitlement, the exercise of such power is essential. The aforesaid view stands fortified in view of that fact that every power is coupled with a duty to act reasonably and the Court/Tribunal/Authority has to proceed having strict adherence to the provisions of law. [Vide Julius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford, (1880) 5 Appeal Cases 214; Commissioner of Police, Bombay v. Gordhandas Bhanji, 1951 SCC 1088 : AIR 1952 SC 16; K.S. Sriniva-san v. Union of India, AIR 1958 SC 419; Yogeshwar Jaiswal v. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, (1985) 1 SCC 725 : AIR 1985 SC 516; Ambica Quarry Works etc. v. State of Gujarat, (1987) 1 SCC 213 : AIR 1987 SC 1073].
xxxx			xxxx			xxxx

26. In Bongaigaon Refinery & Petrochem Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise (A), 1994 (69) E.L.T. 193 (Cal.), the Calcutta High Court, while examining a similar issue and placed reliance upon a large number of judgments and held that the phrase undue hardship would cover a case where the appellant has a strong prima facie case. The phrase also covers a situation where there is an arguable case in the appeal. If the Appellate Authority forms the opinion that appellant has a strong prima facie case, it should dispense with the pre-deposit condition altogether. However, where it is of the opinion that the appellant has no arguable case, the Appellate Authority must safeguard the interest of the Revenue, as the same also cannot be jeopardised.

27. In Sri Krishna v. Union of India, 1998 (104) E.L.T. 305, Delhi High Court considered the issue of dispensation of pre-deposit condition and the concept of undue hardship while considering the provisions of Section 129E of the Customs Act, 1962 and Section 35 of the Act and held that the Court while considering the case of the appellant should examine as to whether the Appellate Authority or Tribunal have dealt with the plea raised by the appellant before it and have considered as to whether the appellant has a prima facie case on merit. In case the appellant has a strong prima facie case, as is most likely to exonerate him from liability and the Appellate Authority/Tribunal insists on the deposit of the amount, it would amount to undue hardship.

28. In Hoogly Mills Co. Ltd. v. Union of India, 1999 (108) E.L.T. 637, the Calcutta High Court again reiterated the view that if the appellant has a strong prima facie case, he is entitled of waiving the pre-deposit condition and in case the Appellate Authority insists to deposit the amount so assessed or penalty so levied, it will cause undue hardship to the assessee. While considering the said case, the Court placed reliance upon the large number of judgments including Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner (Appeals), Central Excise, 1998 (98) E.L.T. 50; Hari Fertilizer v. Union of India, 1985 (22) E.L.T. 301 (All.); Re. American Refrigeration Co. Ltd., 1986 (23) E.L.T. 74; and V.I.T. Sea Foods v. Collector of Customs, 1989 (42) E.L.T. 220 (Ker.), wherein the Courts had expressed the similar view.

29. In I.T.C. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise and Customs (Appeals)ILR 2000 KAR 25, while examining the issue of pre-deposit under Section 35 of the Act, after considering a large number of judgments of the Apex Court and various High Courts, it was held as under:
While considering the case of undue hardship, the authority is required to examine the prima facie on merits of the dispute as well. Pleading of financial disability would not be the only consideration. Where the case is fully covered in favour of the assessee by a biding precedent like that of the judgment of the Supreme Court, jurisdictional High Court or a Special Bench of the Tribunal, then to still insist upon the deposit of duty and penalty levied would certainly cause undue hardship to the assessee. Absence of the financial hardship in such a case would be no ground to decline the dispensation of pre-deposit under the proviso to Section 35F. The power to dispense with such deposit is conferred under the authorities has to be exercised precisely in cases like this type and if it is not exercised under such circumstances then this Court will require it to be exercised. Such like cases where two views are not possible then the condition of pre-deposit before the appeal is heard on merits, can be dispensed with. In case two views are possible on interpretation, based on conflicting judgments of the Tribunal or different High Courts in the absence of the judgment of the jurisdictional High Court then the authorities may pass the order under proviso to Section 35F of the Act keeping in view the facts of the case in hand.

35. In view of the above, the aforesaid authorities make it clear that the Court should not grant interim relief/stay of the recovery merely by asking of a party. It has to maintain a balance between the rights of an individual and the State so far as the recovery of sovereign dues is concerned. While considering the application for stay/waiver of a pre-deposit, as required under the law, the Court must apply its mind as to whether the appellant has a strong prima facie case on merit. In case it is covered by the judgment of a Court/Tribunal binding upon the Appellate Authority, it should apply its mind as to whether in view of the said judgment, the appellant is likely to succeed on merit. If an appellant having strong prima facie case, is asked to deposit the amount of assessment so made or penalty so levied, it would cause undue hardship to him, though there may be no financial restrain on the appellant running in a good financial condition. The arguments that appellant is in a position to deposit or if he succeeds in appeal, he will be entitled to get the refund, are not the considerations for deciding the application. The order of the Appellate Authority itself must show that it had applied its mind to the issue raised by the appellant and it has been considered in accordance with the law. The expression undue hardship has a wider connotation as it takes within its ambit the case where the assessee is asked to deposit the amount even if he is likely to exonerate from the total liability on disposal of his appeal. Dispensation of deposit should also be allowed where two views are possible. While considering the application for interim relief, the Court must examine all pros and cons involved in the case and further examine that in case recovery is not stayed, the right of appeal conferred by the legislature and refusal to exercise the discretionary power by the authority to stay/waive the predeposit condition, would be reduced to nugatory/illusory. Undoubtedly, the interest of the Revenue cannot be jeopardized but that does not mean that in order to protect the interest of the Revenue, the Court or authority should exercise its duty under the law to take into consideration the rights and interest of an in dividual. It is also clear that before any goods could be subjected to duty, it has to be established that it has been manufactured and it is marketable and to prove that it is marketable, the burden is on the Revenue and not on the manufacturer.

19. Though some of the decisions noticed by us hereinabove pertained to pre-deposit prescriptions placed by a statute, the principles enunciated therein would clearly be of relevance while examining the extent of the power that stands placed in the hands of the AO in terms of Section 220(6) of the Act. In our considered opinion, the respondents have clearly erred in proceeding on the assumption that the application for consideration of outstanding demands being placed in abeyance could not have even been entertained without a 20% pre-deposit. The aforesaid stand as taken is thoroughly misconceived and wholly untenable in law. 
20. Undisputedly, and on the date when the impugned adjustments came to be made, the application moved by the petitioner referable to Section 220(6) of the Act had neither been considered nor disposed of. The respondents have thus in our considered opinion clearly acted arbitrarily in proceeding to adjust the demand for AY 2018-19 against available refunds without attending to that application. This action of the respondents is wholly arbitrary and unfair. The intimation of adjustments being proposed would hardly be of any relevance or consequence once it is found that the application for stay remained pending and the said fact is not an issue of contestation. 
21. We consequently allow the instant writ petition and remit the matter to the respondents for considering the application of the petitioner under Section 220(6) in accordance with the observations made hereinabove. The issue of the amount of refund liable to be released shall abide by the decision which the respondents shall now take pursuant to the directions framed hereinabove.

Mar ital bonds are delicate emotional human relationship s and 
involvement of any third pe rson could result in complete collapse of 
trust, faith, and tranquillity. Any sort of influence by a third person can 
just be a silent destroyer of the bond , leading to prolonged 
irreconcilable differences. Such relations eventually become a ticking 
time b omb,  where feelings of anguish, despair, rejection and 
disappointment get trapped and post explosion , the shrapnel  of these 
suppressed feelings  causes injur y to everyone  involved , whether directly 
or indirectly.  
1. The present  Appeal under Order 41 Rule 1 CP C, 1908 has been filed 
on behalf of the appellant/ husband  against the Judgment dated 21.12.1999  of 
the learned Additional District Judge, denying the  divorce  on the ground of  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 2 of 11 
 cruelty in a petition filed by the appellant /husband  (Petitioner in the Divorce 
Petition)  unde r Section 13(1)  (ia) of HMA .  
2. Briefly stated , the parties got married on 06.12.1982 and were 
blessed with a da ughter and a son on 26 .09.1984 and 26.08.1991 
respectively.  
3. The appellant/petitioner  (husband)  had asserted in his Divorce 
Petition  that the respondent was disrespectful and refused to take care of 
him and even assaulted him physically.  She was in a habit of extracting 
money and forced him to give expensive gifts to her relatives and had no 
affection towards him or his family members.  It was asserted that the 
respondent went to Patiala on 16.06.1992 on a false pretext of illness of her 
mother while the appellant had to go to Kaza for his office work.  
Subsequently, he came to know that her younger sister had gone missing for 
the last t hree days and a false pretext of illness of mother had been told to 
him.  On return from Kaza, he stopped at the house of respondent’s family 
in Patiala and tried to coun sel the family  to let the sister marry the man with 
whom she had gone, but he was not appreciated for his concern and was 
threatened with divorce and ridiculed in filthy language by the resp ondent 
and the family members.  
4. On a pervious occasion , she quarreled with him when his sister got 
married on 03.01.198 7 at Arya Samaj Mandir, Vasant Vi har, and advised 
him to not  attend the wedding  of his own sister.  
5. The appellant had further asserted that while he was operated in G.M. 
Modi Hospital on 15.07.1993 for Appendicitis, the respondent quarreled 
with him despite him being in terrible pain and w as forced by the ward staff 
to leave the hospit al.  She made false allegations  of appellant leading an  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 3 of 11 
 immoral life and even made  false and baseless allegations of him having an 
illicit relationship with one Ms. B.S.,  in her complaint dated 04.07.1994 
filed before Women Cell, P.S. Hauz Khas, Delhi.  
6. The appellant asserted that on 02.07.1994 while he returned from 
Bhopal, the respondent along with her parents and sister came to his house 
and they threatened him with his life.  The respondent thereafter , stopped 
performing her conjugal duties for more than two years and they started 
living separately in the room , though in the same house.  
7. The appellant asserted that because of s uch conduct of the respondent 
his peace of mind was shattere d and he was compelled  to do all the 
household work including cooking and taking care  of the children.  He thus, 
sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.  
8. The respondent /wife  in her Written Statement  asserted that by 
filing the Divorce Petition, he was seeking to take advantage of his own 
wrongs.  Essentially, it is asserted that their relationship was cordial till the 
appellant  allegedly got into an illegitimate relationship with his colleague 
Ms. B.S. When she came to know about it in 1993, differences cropped up 
between them . It is asserted that because of this illegitimate affair the 
appellant himself started living in a separate room and started ill treating her 
and made her life miserable since December, 1993.   
9. The resp ondent further asserted that Shri N.R.S, father of Ms. B.S., 
also made various representations to the Director of NIEPA, where the 
appellant was employed aside from representation to Secretary, Department 
of Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Police and also 
to Legal Aid and Advice Board, Pati ala House Courts, New Delhi about the 
appellant ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.   
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 4 of 11 
 10. Thereafter, the appellant left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 and 
started residing with  Ms. B.S. and the two children at Malviya Nagar, New 
Delhi.  It is claimed that they were living as husband and wife and the 
children were forced to address Ms. B.S. as mother.  The respondent even 
came to know that Ms. B.S.  was in family way.  
11. The respondent denied all the allegations of being quarrelsome that 
were made by the app ellant against her.  She asserted that she discharged all 
her matrimonial duties with sincerity, but the discord was only on account of 
the illegitimate affair of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  She admitted making a 
compl aint on 04.07.1994 to CAW Cell, howev er, she  mentioned that it was 
made because her  children had been removed from her custody in a 
clandestine manner.  She further clarified that it was the appellant who 
stopped maintaining conjugal relationship and he finally left the matrimonial 
home on 11 .08.1994 on account of his illegitimate relationship.  In fact, on 
the same day he and Ms. B.S.  also left their job at NIEPA.  It was therefore 
claimed that appellant was not entitled to Divorce.  
12. The appellant in his replication  denied all the allegations o f illicit 
relationship and claimed them to be defamatory.   He submitted that he even 
filed a complaint under Section 500 IPC which was pending disposal before 
the learned Metropolitan Magistrate , Delhi.  He further asserted that the 
parents of   Ms. B.S had  come to the hostel where Ms. B.S. was residing and 
gave public beating to her at the bus stop of Ganga Hostel and was dragged 
to the parked vehicle.  The appellant had tried to intervene and pacified the 
parents of Ms. B.S. on which they got upset and mad e wild allegations 
against his character.   He explained that Ms. B.S. had been engaged by him 
only as a governess to the children.  He reiterated his allegations of cruelty  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 5 of 11 
 against the respondent/wife.  
13. Issues  were framed on 04.12.1996  as under : 
“(i) Whethe r the respondent has treated the 
petitioner with cruelty after solemnization of marriage?  
(ii) Relief.” 
 
14. The appellant appeared as PW1  and Ms. B.S. as PW2  as well as  Mr. 
N.C. S ., father of Ms. B.S as CW1. The respondent appeared as RW1  and 
also examined Ms . Bharti as RW2 , H.C. Dal Chand as RW3 , Shri Prem Pal 
official of Syndicate Bank as RW4 , Mr. G.S. Bhardwaj, Administrative 
Officer of NIEPA as RW5 , Mrs. Kusum, Ahlmad from the Court of learned 
Metropolitan Magistrate as RW6 , Ms. Saroj Bala Sub Inspector of  Delhi 
Police as RW7 , Ms. Surbi Sarkar, sister of Ms. B.S. as RW8 , Ramesh 
Chand, LDC from the Office of Delhi Legal Aid & Advice Board as RW9  
and  Mrs. Bindu Khandelwa l as RW10.    
15. The learned ADJ  after referring to the evidence and documents 
concluded  that the relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. was in 
the nature that would cause one to believe that they had a relationship of 
husband and wife , which was unlawful, unauthorized and not sanctioned by 
rule and custom  and the possibility of sexual re lationship between them 
could not be over ruled. Hence, the suspicion of the respondent was not held 
to be baseless and her conduct towards the appellant was not found to be 
cruel entitling him to a decree of divorce.  The divorce petition was 
accordingly dismissed.  
16. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Divorce Petition, the appellant/ 
husband has preferred the present Appeal.  
17. Learned counsel for the appellant , in support of his averments in the  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 6 of 11 
 present appeal, has placed reliance  upon the judgment of Shilpa S hailesh vs. 
Varun Sreenivasan  Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1118 of 214, Naveen Kohli 
vs. Neelu Kohli  Appeal (Civil) 812 of 2004 of the Apex Court, Dishad 
Kushwaha vs. Rituraj Singh  FAONO.653/2016 of High Court of Madhya 
Pradesh XXXX vs. XXXX  MAT Appeal No. 513/2021 of High Court of 
Keral a and K. Mallikarjuna vs. H.A. Sudha Mallikarjuna  Misc. FAO 
No.4314 of 2012 of High Court of Karnataka, and sought a prayer for setting 
aside of decree dated 21.12.1999 and for grant of divorce under 13 (1) (ia) 
of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  
18. Submissions heard  and record perus ed. 
19. It has emerged from the testimony of the respondent that she and the 
appellant met while they were studying in JNU together for about a year and 
half prior to their marriage on 08.12.1982.  They wer e both blessed with a 
son and a daughter and apparently lived cordially and had a happy married 
life till about 1993.  Apparently, major differences started emerging between 
them in the year 1994.  
20. It is one of those unfortunate cases where after the marria ge of the 
parties on 06.12.1982 , the relation inter se  them could remain stable till 
about December, 1993.   Life in all its uncertainties , unfolded when despite 
having a cordial married life for sufficiently long period of 10 years, 
apparently the appellan t developed affection for his colleague Ms. B.S. who 
was working in the same office , and that was the point when the entire world 
of the respondent came down shattering.  The appellant himself has stated 
that the respondent started making allegations of il licit relationship with Ms. 
B.S.  However, these allegations were not unfounded, as is borne out from 
the evidence on record.     
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 7 of 11 
 21. The appellant was admittedly admitted in G.M. Modi Hospital on 
15.07.1993 and was operated for acute Appendicitis.  According to  him, the 
respondent arrived in the hospital and had a quarrel because of which she 
was forced out of the Ward by the hospital staff.  The respondent has denied 
this incident vehemently in her testimony who has rather deposed that she 
took full care of the  appellant while he was admitted in the hospital . 
22. It is evide nt from the respective testimonies  of the  parties that  the 
dispute inter -se the parties had the genesis in the association of the appellant 
with Ms. B.S. She admittedly came to be known to the ap pellant while she 
was working in Indian Institute of Statistics in which the appellant himself 
admits he had an association.  Sub sequently, Ms. B.S. got appointed in 
NIEPA, where the appellant was also working.  Their intimacy became more 
while working tog ether, which is evident from the admission of the 
appellant that he used to  take her along with him on the official tours and 
had even taken her to Kaza along with the children.  He while returning 
from Kaza had gone with her and the children to the parent -in-law’s house 
in Patiala.  He has also admitted that many a times she used to accompany 
him for various official tours , but has tried to explain it by asserting that she 
had accompanied him only as Junior Associate.  
23. The appellant  has denied vehemently th at he had any illicit 
relationship with her, but his own contentions get defeated by his own 
admission in the petition that she came to live with him in his house in 
Malviya Nagar . The appellant gave a fantastic explanation that she had 
shifted with him as  a governess to take care of the children.  According to 
the appellant, he had paid her Rs.15,000/ - per month for the job.  
Interestingly, Ms. B.S. was herself a government employee working in  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 8 of 11 
 NEIPA and she being employed as a governess and even been alleg edly paid 
Rs.15,000/ - is an explanation, which can  be only termed as absurd as it can 
be.   
24. In this context it would also be pertinent to refer to the testimony of 
RW2 , Ms. Bharti , a family friend who had also deposed that when she had 
visited the house of  the appellant in the year 1994 -95, she not only saw Ms. 
B.S. present in the house maintaining it like a housewife, but the children 
were addressing her as ""mother "".  
25.  Another material witness examined by the respondent was RW8 
Surbhi Sarkar , elder sister of Ms. B.S. who also had deposed that her 
younger sister , Ms. B.S. , had been residing in the house of the appellant with 
him since 1994.  She also deposed that it was this relationship between the 
appellant and Ms. B.S. which became a cause of trouble in t heir family as 
was reflected in the various letters and complaints sent by her father to 
various Authorities.  The relationship had perturbed the family a lot.  
26. Aside from the admissions made in the petition as well as the 
testimony by the appellant  and oth er witnesses , there is other overwhelming 
documentary evidence.  The appellant  has admitted that while he was 
residing in Malviya Nagar, complaints had been made by the neighbors  
questioning the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  A complaint was 
made by the neighbors  to the police vide Diary No.1966 of 30.11.1994 
which is 'Mark A ' and had been produced by PW3 H .C. Daal Chand.   
Subsequently, the  appellant  had sought to explain this complaint by claiming 
that this was withdrawn vide letter Ex.PW1/R1 .  The complaint may have 
been  withdrawn subsequently and the appellant may have tried to explain 
that the neighbors  eventually were convinced about his association with Ms.  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 9 of 11 
 B.S and had withdrawn their apprehension , but the fact remains that Ms. 
B.S. admit tedly came to reside with the appellant at Malviya Nagar to which 
there was an objection taken by the neighbors .   
27. The second set of documentary evidence , which is revealing about the 
relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S. , are the complaints written by 
none other than Mr. N.C.S.,  father of Ms. B.S. , to the Department of NEIPA,  
the Police,  the Delhi Legal Aid  Board  and other Agencies alleging that the 
appellant was ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.   Interestingly, Mr. 
N.C.S was present in the C ourt at that time when the testimony of RPW2 
Ms. B.S. was recorded at the instance of the appellant,  and his testimony 
was also recorded as CW1.  Pertinently, he admitted having writte n the letter 
Ex.RW5/1  to NEIPA and Ex.RW8/6  as well as document Ex.RW8/P 1 to 
Delhi Legal Services Authority . Additionally,  Ex.RW6/1  and Ex.RW6/2, 
which are his statement s recorded in FIR No. 313/94 revea l that Ms. B.S. 
was made hostile to her family and was being influenced by the appellant . In 
all these letters /documents , not only had he taken an objection of his 
daughter who was much younger , having unacceptable friendship with the 
appellant  but has  also stated that the appellant has mislead her and even 
proposed to marry Ms. B.S.  However, in his cross -examination, he tried  to 
back track by asserting that all those complaints were made due to 
misunderstanding.  
28. All these complaints which are contemporary to the incidents 
happening , have been written from 04.03.1994  onwards .  It is quite apparent 
that subsequently, the appella nt was able to prevail upon not only Ms. B.S. 
but also on her father who were examined as RPW -1 as the witness of the 
appellant  and CW -1 as the witness by the Court,  on 31.08.1998.   
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 10 of 11 
 29.  The very fact that the complaints are all admitted by CW1 , Mr. 
N.C.S ,  clearly corroborate the averments of the respondent about the 
appellant having developed affection with Ms. B.S. outside his marriage 
with the respondent.  The appellant may have been able to win over the 
father of Ms. B.S. during the pendency of the divorce  proceedings, but the 
claim of the respondent of appellant having developed relationship outside 
the marriage is fully corroborated and supported not only by the oral 
testimony, but also by the documents.   
30. The overwhelming evidence on record reflects that  indeed the 
appellant who got i nvolved with Ms. B.S. since 1994  and left the house in 
August , 1994 was the one who had committed the cruelty upon the 
respondent.  The respondent wife cannot be penalized for making such 
allegations and protesting about the relationship which have a strong basis 
and foundation.  In fact, she had a justification to complain about the 
conduct of the appellant and to take any view otherwise would indeed b e 
committing cruelty upon the respondent.  
31. It becomes apposite to mention th at an FIR No.313/1992 under 
Section 498A/406 IPC had been registered against the appellant, his sister 
and brother -in-law and while the sister and brother -in-law were discharged 
at the time of framing of charge s, the appellant has been subsequently 
acquitt ed vide judgment dated 03.05.2013. However, considering the 
overwhelming evidence revealing the relationship with Ms. B.S., this   
acquittal  subsequent to the divorce  itself , cannot be a ground to say in the 
peculiar facts of this case , that any kind of cru elty had been committed upon 
him by the respondent.  Merely because there is an acquittal by a Criminal 
Court, does not wash away the cruelty  committed by the appellant  of being  
MAT.APP.(F.C.) 2 41/2023 Page 11 of 11 
 involved with a young girl during the subsistence of his marriage with the 
respondent ; mere acquittal in a criminal case cannot be a ground to grant 
divorce.  
32. We, in the light of blatant conduct of the appellant is showing scant 
regard to his matrimonial relationship, are compelled to observe that despite 
it being a failed marriage o f over 40 years, granting Divorce would be 
adding a premium to the wrong acts of the appellant. While the human 
emotions  know no bounds and rules, but definitely the human sensibilities 
emanating from the mind should have prevailed for an educated person like 
the appellant to have reigned his affections for a third person, with scant 
regard for the respondent who had reposed complete faith by entering into 
the vows of marriage with him.  This is one case where S. 23(1)(a) of the  
HMA, 1955 , which provides th at no person can take advantage of its own

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J. 
Marital bonds are delicate emotional human relationships and involvement of any third person could result in complete collapse of trust, faith, and tranquillity. Any sort of influence by a third person can just be a silent destroyer of the bond, leading to prolonged irreconcilable differences. Such relations eventually become a ticking time bomb, where feelings of anguish, despair, rejection and disappointment get trapped and post explosion, the shrapnel of these suppressed feelings causes injury to everyone involved, whether directly or indirectly. 
1. The present Appeal under Order 41 Rule 1 CPC, 1908 has been filed on behalf of the appellant/husband against the Judgment dated 21.12.1999 of the learned Additional District Judge, denying the divorce on the ground of cruelty in a petition filed by the appellant/husband (Petitioner in the Divorce Petition) under Section 13(1) (ia) of HMA. 
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married on 06.12.1982 and were blessed with a daughter and a son on 26.09.1984 and 26.08.1991 respectively.
3. The appellant/petitioner (husband) had asserted in his Divorce Petition that the respondent was disrespectful and refused to take care of him and even assaulted him physically.  She was in a habit of extracting money and forced him to give expensive gifts to her relatives and had no affection towards him or his family members.  It was asserted that the respondent went to Patiala on 16.06.1992 on a false pretext of illness of her mother while the appellant had to go to Kaza for his office work.  Subsequently, he came to know that her younger sister had gone missing for the last three days and a false pretext of illness of mother had been told to him.  On return from Kaza, he stopped at the house of respondents family in Patiala and tried to counsel the family to let the sister marry the man with whom she had gone, but he was not appreciated for his concern and was threatened with divorce and ridiculed in filthy language by the respondent and the family members. 
4. On a pervious occasion, she quarreled with him when his sister got married on 03.01.1987 at Arya Samaj Mandir, Vasant Vihar, and advised him to not attend the wedding of his own sister.
5. The appellant had further asserted that while he was operated in G.M. Modi Hospital on 15.07.1993 for Appendicitis, the respondent quarreled with him despite him being in terrible pain and was forced by the ward staff to leave the hospital.  She made false allegations of appellant leading an immoral life and even made  false and baseless allegations of him having an illicit relationship with one Ms. B.S.,  in her complaint dated 04.07.1994 filed before Women Cell, P.S. Hauz Khas, Delhi.
6. The appellant asserted that on 02.07.1994 while he returned from Bhopal, the respondent along with her parents and sister came to his house and they threatened him with his life.  The respondent thereafter, stopped performing her conjugal duties for more than two years and they started living separately in the room, though in the same house.
7. The appellant asserted that because of such conduct of the respondent his peace of mind was shattered and he was compelled to do all the household work including cooking and taking care of the children.  He thus, sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.
8. The respondent/wife in her Written Statement asserted that by filing the Divorce Petition, he was seeking to take advantage of his own wrongs.  Essentially, it is asserted that their relationship was cordial till the appellant allegedly got into an illegitimate relationship with his colleague Ms. B.S. When she came to know about it in 1993, differences cropped up between them. It is asserted that because of this illegitimate affair the appellant himself started living in a separate room and started ill treating her and made her life miserable since December, 1993.  
9. The respondent further asserted that Shri N.R.S, father of Ms. B.S., also made various representations to the Director of NIEPA, where the appellant was employed aside from representation to Secretary, Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resources Development, Police and also to Legal Aid and Advice Board, Patiala House Courts, New Delhi about the appellant ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.
10. Thereafter, the appellant left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 and started residing with Ms. B.S. and the two children at Malviya Nagar, New Delhi.  It is claimed that they were living as husband and wife and the children were forced to address Ms. B.S. as mother. The respondent even came to know that Ms. B.S. was in family way.
11. The respondent denied all the allegations of being quarrelsome that were made by the appellant against her.  She asserted that she discharged all her matrimonial duties with sincerity, but the discord was only on account of the illegitimate affair of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  She admitted making a complaint on 04.07.1994 to CAW Cell, however, she mentioned that it was made because her children had been removed from her custody in a clandestine manner.  She further clarified that it was the appellant who stopped maintaining conjugal relationship and he finally left the matrimonial home on 11.08.1994 on account of his illegitimate relationship.  In fact, on the same day he and Ms. B.S. also left their job at NIEPA. It was therefore claimed that appellant was not entitled to Divorce.
12. The appellant in his replication denied all the allegations of illicit relationship and claimed them to be defamatory.  He submitted that he even filed a complaint under Section 500 IPC which was pending disposal before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.  He further asserted that the parents of  Ms. B.S had come to the hostel where Ms. B.S. was residing and gave public beating to her at the bus stop of Ganga Hostel and was dragged to the parked vehicle.  The appellant had tried to intervene and pacified the parents of Ms. B.S. on which they got upset and made wild allegations against his character.  He explained that Ms. B.S. had been engaged by him only as a governess to the children.  He reiterated his allegations of cruelty against the respondent/wife.
13. Issues were framed on 04.12.1996 as under:
(i)	Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty after solemnization of marriage?
(ii)	Relief.

14. The appellant appeared as PW1 and Ms. B.S. as PW2 as well as Mr. N.C. S., father of Ms. B.S as CW1. The respondent appeared as RW1 and also examined Ms. Bharti as RW2, H.C. Dal Chand as RW3, Shri Prem Pal official of Syndicate Bank as RW4, Mr. G.S. Bhardwaj, Administrative Officer of NIEPA as RW5, Mrs. Kusum, Ahlmad from the Court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate as RW6, Ms. Saroj Bala Sub Inspector of Delhi Police as RW7, Ms. Surbi Sarkar, sister of Ms. B.S. as RW8, Ramesh Chand, LDC from the Office of Delhi Legal Aid & Advice Board as RW9 and  Mrs. Bindu Khandelwal as RW10.  
15. The learned ADJ after referring to the evidence and documents concluded that the relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. was in the nature that would cause one to believe that they had a relationship of husband and wife, which was unlawful, unauthorized and not sanctioned by rule and custom and the possibility of sexual relationship between them could not be over ruled. Hence, the suspicion of the respondent was not held to be baseless and her conduct towards the appellant was not found to be cruel entitling him to a decree of divorce.  The divorce petition was accordingly dismissed.
16. Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Divorce Petition, the appellant/ husband has preferred the present Appeal. 
17. Learned counsel for the appellant, in support of his averments in the present appeal, has placed reliance upon the judgment of Shilpa Shailesh vs. Varun Sreenivasan Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1118 of 214, Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli Appeal (Civil) 812 of 2004 of the Apex Court, Dishad Kushwaha vs. Rituraj Singh FAONO.653/2016 of High Court of Madhya Pradesh XXXX vs. XXXX MAT Appeal No.513/2021 of High Court of Kerala and K. Mallikarjuna vs. H.A. Sudha Mallikarjuna Misc. FAO No.4314 of 2012 of High Court of Karnataka, and sought a prayer for setting aside of decree dated 21.12.1999 and for grant of divorce under 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.
18. Submissions heard and record perused.
19. It has emerged from the testimony of the respondent that she and the appellant met while they were studying in JNU together for about a year and half prior to their marriage on 08.12.1982.  They were both blessed with a son and a daughter and apparently lived cordially and had a happy married life till about 1993.  Apparently, major differences started emerging between them in the year 1994.
20. It is one of those unfortunate cases where after the marriage of the parties on 06.12.1982, the relation inter se them could remain stable till about December, 1993.  Life in all its uncertainties, unfolded when despite having a cordial married life for sufficiently long period of 10 years, apparently the appellant developed affection for his colleague Ms. B.S. who was working in the same office, and that was the point when the entire world of the respondent came down shattering.  The appellant himself has stated that the respondent started making allegations of illicit relationship with Ms. B.S.  However, these allegations were not unfounded, as is borne out from the evidence on record.  
21. The appellant was admittedly admitted in G.M. Modi Hospital on 15.07.1993 and was operated for acute Appendicitis.  According to him, the respondent arrived in the hospital and had a quarrel because of which she was forced out of the Ward by the hospital staff.  The respondent has denied this incident vehemently in her testimony who has rather deposed that she took full care of the appellant while he was admitted in the hospital.
22. It is evident from the respective testimonies of the parties that the dispute inter-se the parties had the genesis in the association of the appellant with Ms. B.S. She admittedly came to be known to the appellant while she was working in Indian Institute of Statistics in which the appellant himself admits he had an association.  Subsequently, Ms. B.S. got appointed in NIEPA, where the appellant was also working.  Their intimacy became more while working together, which is evident from the admission of the appellant that he used to take her along with him on the official tours and had even taken her to Kaza along with the children.  He while returning from Kaza had gone with her and the children to the parent-in-laws house in Patiala.  He has also admitted that many a times she used to accompany him for various official tours, but has tried to explain it by asserting that she had accompanied him only as Junior Associate.
23. The appellant has denied vehemently that he had any illicit relationship with her, but his own contentions get defeated by his own admission in the petition that she came to live with him in his house in Malviya Nagar. The appellant gave a fantastic explanation that she had shifted with him as a governess to take care of the children.  According to the appellant, he had paid her Rs.15,000/- per month for the job.  Interestingly, Ms. B.S. was herself a government employee working in NEIPA and she being employed as a governess and even been allegedly paid Rs.15,000/- is an explanation, which can be only termed as absurd as it can be.  
24. In this context it would also be pertinent to refer to the testimony of RW2, Ms. Bharti, a family friend who had also deposed that when she had visited the house of the appellant in the year 1994-95, she not only saw Ms. B.S. present in the house maintaining it like a housewife, but the children were addressing her as ""mother"". 
25.  Another material witness examined by the respondent was RW8 Surbhi Sarkar, elder sister of Ms. B.S. who also had deposed that her younger sister, Ms. B.S., had been residing in the house of the appellant with him since 1994.  She also deposed that it was this relationship between the appellant and Ms. B.S. which became a cause of trouble in their family as was reflected in the various letters and complaints sent by her father to various Authorities.  The relationship had perturbed the family a lot.
26. Aside from the admissions made in the petition as well as the testimony by the appellant and other witnesses, there is other overwhelming documentary evidence.  The appellant has admitted that while he was residing in Malviya Nagar, complaints had been made by the neighbors questioning the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S.  A complaint was made by the neighbors to the police vide Diary No.1966 of 30.11.1994 which is 'Mark A' and had been produced by PW3 H.C. Daal Chand.  Subsequently, the appellant had sought to explain this complaint by claiming that this was withdrawn vide letter Ex.PW1/R1.  The complaint may have been withdrawn subsequently and the appellant may have tried to explain that the neighbors eventually were convinced about his association with Ms. B.S and had withdrawn their apprehension, but the fact remains that Ms. B.S. admittedly came to reside with the appellant at Malviya Nagar to which there was an objection taken by the neighbors.  
27. The second set of documentary evidence, which is revealing about the relationship of the appellant with Ms. B.S., are the complaints written by none other than Mr. N.C.S., father of Ms. B.S., to the Department of NEIPA, the Police, the Delhi Legal Aid Board and other Agencies alleging that the appellant was ruining the life of his daughter Ms. B.S.  Interestingly, Mr. N.C.S was present in the Court at that time when the testimony of RPW2 Ms. B.S. was recorded at the instance of the appellant, and his testimony was also recorded as CW1.  Pertinently, he admitted having written the letter Ex.RW5/1 to NEIPA and Ex.RW8/6 as well as document Ex.RW8/P1 to Delhi Legal Services Authority. Additionally, Ex.RW6/1 and Ex.RW6/2, which are his statements recorded in FIR No. 313/94 reveal that Ms. B.S. was made hostile to her family and was being influenced by the appellant. In all these letters/documents, not only had he taken an objection of his daughter who was much younger, having unacceptable friendship with the appellant but has  also stated that the appellant has mislead her and even proposed to marry Ms. B.S.  However, in his cross-examination, he tried to back track by asserting that all those complaints were made due to misunderstanding.
28. All these complaints which are contemporary to the incidents happening, have been written from 04.03.1994 onwards.  It is quite apparent that subsequently, the appellant was able to prevail upon not only Ms. B.S. but also on her father who were examined as RPW-1 as the witness of the appellant and CW-1 as the witness by the Court, on 31.08.1998. 
29.  The very fact that the complaints are all admitted by CW1, Mr. N.C.S,  clearly corroborate the averments of the respondent about the appellant having developed affection with Ms. B.S. outside his marriage with the respondent.  The appellant may have been able to win over the father of Ms. B.S. during the pendency of the divorce proceedings, but the claim of the respondent of appellant having developed relationship outside the marriage is fully corroborated and supported not only by the oral testimony, but also by the documents.  
30. The overwhelming evidence on record reflects that indeed the appellant who got involved with Ms. B.S. since 1994 and left the house in August, 1994 was the one who had committed the cruelty upon the respondent.  The respondent wife cannot be penalized for making such allegations and protesting about the relationship which have a strong basis and foundation.  In fact, she had a justification to complain about the conduct of the appellant and to take any view otherwise would indeed be committing cruelty upon the respondent.
31. It becomes apposite to mention that an FIR No.313/1992 under Section 498A/406 IPC had been registered against the appellant, his sister and brother-in-law and while the sister and brother-in-law were discharged at the time of framing of charges, the appellant has been subsequently acquitted vide judgment dated 03.05.2013. However, considering the overwhelming evidence revealing the relationship with Ms. B.S., this  acquittal subsequent to the divorce itself, cannot be a ground to say in the peculiar facts of this case, that any kind of cruelty had been committed upon him by the respondent.  Merely because there is an acquittal by a Criminal Court, does not wash away the cruelty committed by the appellant of being involved with a young girl during the subsistence of his marriage with the respondent; mere acquittal in a criminal case cannot be a ground to grant divorce.
32. We, in the light of blatant conduct of the appellant is showing scant regard to his matrimonial relationship, are compelled to observe that despite it being a failed marriage of over 40 years, granting Divorce would be adding a premium to the wrong acts of the appellant. While the human emotions  know no bounds and rules, but definitely the human sensibilities emanating from the mind should have prevailed for an educated person like the appellant to have reigned his affections for a third person, with scant regard for the respondent who had reposed complete faith by entering into the vows of marriage with him.  This is one case where S.23(1)(a) of the HMA, 1955, which provides that no person can take advantage of its own wrong, comes into play, in full force. 
33. We hereby conclude that the learned Additional District Judge has rightly concluded that it is the appellant who is responsible for acts of cruelty towards the respondent and had rejected the divorce petition.
34. Accordingly, there is no merit in the present Appeal, which is hereby dismissed along with pending application(s), if any.

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.  
1. The present appeal  under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 
has been preferred by the appellant against the Judgment dated 15.03.2017 , 
passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Delhi vide which the divorce 
Petition bearing HMA No. 61511/2016/04 under Section 13(1) ( ia) of the 
Hindu Marriage Act, 1955  (hereinafter referred to as the “Act, 1955”) , filed 
by the appellant/husband, has been dismissed.  
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married, according to Hindu Customs 
and Rites on 15.03.1983, when the appellant was 24 years and the 
respondent was 20 years of age. They resi ded as husband and wife at 
Kutopur,  Rewari (Haryana)  and from their wedlock, three sons were born on  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 2 of 19 
 07.06.1984, 16.07.1985 and 17.03.1987 , respectively . 
3. The case of the appellant is that  he treated his wife with love and 
affection and provided her with all the comforts of life  but within 2 to 3 
months  of the marriage, the appellant discovered that she had indifferent 
habits , was of a temperamental nature  and would get instigated on petty 
matters  at the instance of her parents, who caused unnecessary interference 
in their marri ed life. She insulted, abused and misbehaved with him and his 
parents, in the presence of relatives, friends and neighbours , despit e the fact 
that he always treated her with great affection . He took care o f her during 
the three pregnancies  and made all efforts to persuade the respondent to live 
as a devote d wife, but all his efforts went in vain. The respondent used to 
extort money fr om him at the behest of her parents and when he did not 
fulfil her demands , she  lodge d false complaints against him , based on 
concocted facts , only to harass him and to compel him to accede to her 
motivated demands.  
4. The appellant had asserted that they ha d a simple marriage, after 
which they started residing in his native village home  in Kutopur, Rewari 
(Haryana)  till 1986. The respondent had no interest in resi ding in the village 
and upon her  insistence, the appellant  shifted to her parents ’ hous e at Naga l 
Raya, Delhi Cantt. along with their  entire belongings.  
5. Admittedly, the father of the respondent had been living separately 
from his wife, since prior to the marriage of the appellant with respondent . 
He had been residing with the two younger brothers of the respondent , at 
Delhi Cantt. Sagarpur , while the mother of the respondent  was residing   
with her elder brother, at Kalu Sarai Begum Pur, Near LIT., New Delhi . The 
appellant had asserted that because of the pressure tactics of the respondent,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 3 of 19 
 he was co mpelled to remain at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., in the parental 
home of the respondent, till 1988.  
6. According to the appellant, he continued to bear the entire household 
expenses, despite which the respondent misbehaved and manhandled  the 
appellant and made his life a hell.  
7. The appellant further asserted that the respondent had no interest in 
his relatives and had refused to attend the marriage of his younger brother , at 
the native village.  Piqued  by the insistence  of the appellant, the respondent 
left the ho use at Nagal Raya and went to live with her mother at Begum Pur, 
Delhi, without  giving  any information  and without the knowledge of the 
appellant. She even made a false complaint against him , at his village 
address.  
8. The appellant has asserted that on retu rning from his native village 
after attending his brother’s marriage, he shifted to rented accommodation at 
Chirag Delhi, in the year 1988, where he stayed for about one and a half 
years  till 1990 . It was only after great persuasion that the respondent joi ned 
his company , even though an inquiry was conducted against him on the 
complaint that had been filed  by her . However, the complaint was eventually 
closed.  
9. The appellant had further disclosed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat 
of DDA was booked by his fat her which was allotted to him and the 
possession was delivered in the year 1990. The appellant shifted with the 
respondent to the said flat but on the instigation of her family, he was forced 
to sell the flat and buy two plots of land measuring 100 square yards and 50 
square yards, in Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai , Delhi . 
10. The appellant has further asserted that while he was residing in Chirag  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 4 of 19 
 Delhi, the mother of the respondent was constructing her house and the 
appellant was compelled to contribute Rs.15,000/ -, in order to maintain 
cordial relationship  with the respondent as the mother -in-law was not 
financially sound. However, despite doing all this, the respondent and her 
mother, without any prior information, took their belongings from the rented 
house and s hifted to the house of the mother. Even thereafter, t he appellant 
along with the respondent resided in the mother’s house for about two 
months  till March 1991 . 
11. He further asserted that from time to time, he was compelled t o give 
money to the brother of the  respondent and her family. On 02.04.1996 , he 
was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/ - to Kanh aya Lal, brother of the 
respondent, on the occasion of his marriage . He also transferred Rs.30,000/ - 
in the account of her elder brother, Som  Dutt alias Gopal, to help hi m in 
meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his 
plot of land.  He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/ - to Kanhaya Lal, 
to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the 
respondent. In the year 2000, h e was also asked to pay  Rs.50,000/ - to Sona 
Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of 
the engagement of her daughter  but when t he appellant refused to give 
money , it infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, wh en the 
appellant returned from G uwahati , he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/ -, at the 
time of the marriage of another  daughter . Even though he again refused  to 
give the money, he was illegally detained when he came to Delhi on 
29.07.2001 and was forced to give  a sum of Rs.1,00,000/ - through cheque , 
to the respondent .  
12. The appellant  has further submitted that he was transferred to  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 5 of 19 
 Guwahati  in August, 1988, where he resided till March 2001.  Meanwhile, 
the appellant came to Delhi in March , 2000, for a few days but  was shocked  
to learn that the respondent was having contact and relations with one 
Mahesh Kumar, who had earlier assaulted the appellant and against whom, 
the FIR had been registered . Upon being confronted, the respondent  
extended threats to the appellant  that he would face serious consequences.  
13. The appellant had further asserted that the respondent had pressurised 
him to transfer the house/plot measuring 50 square yards , with a structure 
thereon , in the name of the respondent and when he refused, she thr eatened 
him with implication in false case and also made a false complaint 
containing baseless and fabr icated allegations against him, his parents and 
other relatives in Crime against Women Cell , Nanakpura , Delhi , though, it 
was subsequently consigned to t he Record Room .  
14. On 18.10.2001, Padam Singh , the brother of the respondent along 
with his associate s, entered the house of the appellant and physically 
assaulted him and damaged the property , since he was not willing to yield to 
the uncalled demands and dictates  of the respondent.  It is asserted that 
because of such cruelties  committed upon him by the respondent and her 
family members, he became completely depressed and tried to commit 
suicide by consuming poison  and was taken to Safdarjung Hospital, where 
he was admitted.  
15. It is further asserted that the appellant continued to discharge his 
obligations and paid substantial amount of his salary to the respondent , for 
the expenses of the household and also paid various household items. He 
paid various amounts  to the respondent regularly , since December, 2003 and 
aside from such regular payments, he deposited Rs.50,000/ - by way of Fixed

 Deposit, in her name. He even earlier had being depositing cash in her 
account in the year 2001. He even purchased the LIC pol ices, in the name of 
the respondent and their sons for Rs.1,00,000/ - each, for which he has been 
regularly paying the premium . The appellant paid the entire salary to the 
respondent but requested her to give him Rs.200/ - for the pocket expenses 
but she cre ated a scene and abused and manhandled the appellant and lodged 
a false complaint in Police Post Maidan garhi, Police Station;  Mehrauli. The 
appellant was detained in the Police Post for the whole night and was let off 
in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. 
On 24.03.20 04, when he returned from the Police Post , the respondent left 
him.  
16. According to the appellant, in May 2004, on two to three occasion, a n 
attempt was made by the respondent , to force him to accompany her to  a 
nearb y jungle but the appellant fearing from foul play desisted from going 
with her, which antagonised  the respondent. On 29.05.2004, a nother attempt 
to murder and kidnap him was made by her along with the brothers, namely, 
Padam Singh and Kanhiya Lal , which again caused immense mental cruelty, 
tension and agony to him.  
17. He asserted that he had been treated with utmost physical and mental 
cruelty for the last 20 years. She even lodged a false complaint in CAW 
Cell, New Delhi and made b aseless allegations  against him. He filed his 
detailed reply and endeavour was also made by the respondent to get him 
thrown out of his house, which he had built with his heart and all the money.  
The respon dent also made complaints in his  Department to the superior 
officers  and colleagues only with an intention to defame him.        
18. The appellant , thus sought divorce on the ground of cruelty.   
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 7 of 19 
 19. The petition was contested by the respondent , who denied all the 
allegations made against her by the appellant. The respondent had cla imed 
in her Written S tatement that the entire case of the appellant, was based on 
false allegations. She denied that she ever treated the appellant with cruelty 
and asserted that  it was  she, who has been deserted by the appellant , on 
03.05.2004. She claime d that the divorce petition was liable to be dismissed.  
20. The issues from the pleadings, were framed on 19.12.2007 , as 
under: - 
“(i)  Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner 
with cruelty, as alleged, after the solemnization of 
the marriage OPP  
 
(ii) Relief. ” 
 
21. The appellant  appeared as PW-1. He also examined PW -2, Ms. 
Meena Kumari, Record Keeper from Delhi Commission for Women, Vikas 
Bhawan, ITO, Delhi , CAW Cell, to prove the complaints dated 27.07.2001, 
02.04.2004 and the Letter dated 08.08.2001, pu rportedly written by the 
Delhi Legislator, forwarding the complaints to the DCW for enquiries. PW-
3 Sh. Sukesh Kumar, H.G.A.  from LIC of India, produced the records of the 
LIC Policies, taken for the benefit of the children, in the name of the 
respondent.  PW-4, Sh. Ajaib Singh, Engineer Asstt. to S.S.W. (Civil I) 
CCW All India Radio , produced the nomination form, submitted by the 
appellant, with the Department. PW-5 Sh. Raj Kumar Barwal, Deputy 
Manager, PNB IGNOU Branch , produced the statement of account of  the 
appellant.  
22. The respondent appeared as RW -1 and examined her son as RW-2,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 8 of 19 
 Sh. Kulbhushan Kumar . 
23. The learned Principal Judge, Family Courts,  on the basis of the 
entire evidence, concluded that the appellant was unable to discharge the 
burden to prove t hat he had been subjected to such form of cruelty that gave 
a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or 
detrimental  for him to reside with the respondent.  It was observed  that in the 
first seven years of their marriage, they were bles sed with three sons and 
there  was no evidence whatsoever to show how the appellant was being 
subjected to cruelty by the respondent. There was no cogent evidence to 
prove that the respondent had failed to discharge her duties as a wife or as a 
mother. Bald allegations were made by the appellant, which were found to 
be not substantiated by any cogent evidence. The averments of the appellant 
that she used to make sarcastic remarks and called him ‘chasmuddin ‟, 
„andha ‟ (blind)  and „githu ‟, were also found to be  of no consequence. It was 
observed  that such allegations were for the first time made in the                    
cross -examination by the appellant.  
24. It was further observed that there was no cogent evidence of the 
money having been given to the mother -in-law or the brother -in-law.  
25. The complaint dated 15.02.1998 Ex -PW-2/D lodged by the 
respondent with DCP Women Cell, Delhi, wherein the respondent had 
alleged that the appellant had tried to kill her and her three children by 
pouring kerosene, was held to be  not proved. Likewise , the second 
complaint dated 27.10.2001, made in DCW and the third complaint dated 
02.04.2004 in DCW, Delhi, were found to have not been pursued and 
closed.  
26. It was also held that the story of attempted suicide by the appellant on  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 9 of 19 
 25.10.2001, cannot be attributed to any act or omission of the respondent.  
Ld. Judge, Family Court thus,  concluded  that the appellant had failed to 
prove that the respondent had committed any kind of cruelty and the petition 
for divorce was dismissed.  
27. Aggrie ved, the appellant/husband has preferred the present Appeal.   
28. Submissions heard  and the record perused.  
29. The first aspect which emerges from the testimony of the parties, is 
that the appellant, who was  a Civil Engineer  in the Government service , had 
been pr oviding for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, 
throughout the period , that they were together.  
30. Pertinently, the respondent had filed an affidavit of evidence, where 
she had merely claimed that the appellant had not paid anything to m aintain 
the family and miserably neglected to perform his duties as husband and a 
disciplined father and that the future of the three sons got spoiled because of 
the negligence of the appellant. The respondent  has however, admitted in her 
cross -examination  that the appellant provided money for their livelihood, 
though she claimed that it was only a minimum amount to meet their daily 
expenses. She has further admitted that the appellant used to give money for 
her personal expenses, though again , she tried to  qualify by saying that he 
used to take back the money. She also admitted that he had taken LIC 
Policies in her name  as well a s their children, for which he was paying the 
instalments and also admitted that she had received Rs.40,000/ -, for the two 
LIC Pol icies. All her admissions , show that the appellant had been a caring 
husband and had provided for all the requirements of the respondent and the 
children, as per his means.  
31. It is further not in dispute that,  for the first three years of the marriage,  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 10 of 19 
 1983  till 1986, the parties resided at the parental home of the appellant in 
Rewari .  The appellant has explained that since his job was in Delhi, he was 
commuting on the regular basis  to his place of work.  According to the 
appellant, the respondent wanted to reside in Delhi and had no interest to 
reside in a village and because of her constant insistence, they shifted to her 
parents’ house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt. , where the father  was residing 
along with his two sons i.e. the brothers of the respondent. Th e mother, 
however, had been living separately with the third brother of the respondent 
at Kalu Sarai Begampur, New Delhi . There is no challenge that the parties 
resided at Nagal Raya, till 1988.  
32. The appellant had asserted that in the year 1988, he had gon e to attend 
the wedding of his younger brother at the native village, to which the 
respondent refused to accompany. However, on his return, he was shocked 
to find that  without informing him,  the respondent had shifted to her 
mother’s house at Begumpur, Del hi.  
33. She also filed a false complaint against him at the native village 
address. Pertinently, the respondent has deposed nothing about this incident 
in her affidavit of evidence but has admitted in her cross -examination that 
she had a quarrel with the appe llant and that he had beaten her with the fry 
pan and that she suffered injury on her teeth. However, she admits that she 
did not file any complaint to the Police , in regard to this incident. Though 
the respondent claimed to have been beaten up by the appe llant but aside 
from her b ald claims in her cross -examination, there is no other evidence of 
mal-treatment by the appellant, on record.  
34. The respondent in her cross -examination , admitted having made a 
complaint Ex -PW-2/D, to DCP Women Cell, Delhi, in the y ear 1988.  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 11 of 19 
 Significantly, she narrates nothing in her testimony about the alleged cruelty 
which compelled her to make this complaint , but the perusal of the 
complaint shows that she made serious allegations  of the appellant 
attempting to kill her and the th ree son s by pouring kerosene on them. There 
is no evidence that any follow -up action got taken on the said complaint. 
Though serious allegations have been made against the appellant but the 
same have not only been denied by the appellant but also not prove d by the 
respondent.   
35. Though the parties continued to reside together despite their 
differences , but the respondent admittedly made another complaint dated 
27.07.2001, which is exhibited as Ex -PW2/A , wherein she made allegations 
of illicit relationship of the appellant  with some woman  while he was posted 
in Assam. She  volunteered in her cross -examination  that t hese facts were 
disclosed to her by the appellant himself  who stated that earlier the woman 
was in volved with h is boss Mr. D.K. Mishra, but thereaft er, he had passed 
her on to the appellant.   
36. The backdrop of this allegation is that undisputedly,  the appellant was 
a Central Government employee working with the Ministry of Information 
& Broadcasting as a Civil Engineer  and had remained at  Guwahati , from  
1988 to 2001 . The respondent in her cross -examination , claimed that she had 
made the said complaint because the appellant had beaten her seriously . 
From the admissions of the respondent herself, it is evident that she had no 
basis for making such allegati ons but she has been consistent in levelling 
such allegations against the appellant, without any basis. Even in her 
complaint to the police, she had been persistent in making these allegations.  
37. In addition to being beaten up by stick and danda  out of the house at  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 12 of 19 
 gali and mohalla,  with threats to kill her , she even made allegation that the 
appellant with the support of Laxmi Narain Sagar, his mamaji and 
Dharamvati Sagar, mamiji , conspired to kill her. She went on to state that 
many a times, he left the gas  cylinder open in the kitchen while he himself 
came out , with an intent  to burn her. So much so, he did not sleep in the 
house but forced her to sleep, which gave rise to an apprehension in her 
mind that he wanted to kill her , in her sleep. She even made a llegations 
against the Mama and Mami of the appellant by asserting that they used to 
claim about the ir daughter and son -in-law being lawyers and  their in -laws 
being Magistrate and that whatever she may do, she would be thrown on the 
fork of the road.  All these allegations made in the complaint, have not been 
even mentioned by her, in her Written Statement or in her testimony. She 
has also miserably failed to prove the truth of any of these serious 
allegations made against the appellant.  
38. The matter did not end here because she made a third complaint dated 
02.04.20 04, Ex -PW-2/B, to Delhi Commission for Women, Delhi, alleging 
that while the appellant was in Guwahati, one con tractor , Sh. Damodar 
Aggarwal and some people residing in Assam, together started black mailing 
her and she wrote to the Department to transfer him back to Delhi. However, 
her husband started fighting with her regularly and ha d been telling her that 
the colony where they were residing, was not good and that they would sell 
the house and shift  to some other area. On 24th March,  2004  he in the middle 
of the night, demanded the documents of the property and started breaking 
the lock of the almirah with the  hammer and when she tried to prevent the 
appellant, he tried to hit her with the hammer on her head but was prevented 
by their elder son. He even tried to strangulate her but she was able to  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 13 of 19 
 escape and g et out of the house. She then called the Police at Number 100 
and the police arrived and they were taken to police post Maidangarhi . 
While she a nd her son w ere sent back , the appellant was detained in the 
Police Post . She felt that she had not got any justice and therefore, made the 
complaint.  
39.  Significantly, here also not only has she made allegations of physical 
beatings by the appellant but als o of his greed for the property documents . 
But again, in her affidavit of evidence, not a word has been spoken by her. 
While the appellant had deposed about this complaint in his testimony , but 
pertinently , there is no cogent cross -examination done on this  complaint by 
the respondent. In her own testimony as well, she has not explained any of 
the allegations that have been made in the said complaint.  
40. It is more than evident from the evidence on record that the 
respondent has been making irresponsible compl aints not only of being 
subjected to physical cruelty by the appellant but even of illicit relationship 
of the appellant , with some woman.  
41. In the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita  X (2014) SLT 126. the 
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false c omplaint against the 
husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the 
purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act.   
42. Along si milar lines, the Supreme Court in the case of  Ravi Kumar vs. 
Julmidevi  (2010) 4 SCC 476 has categ orically held that  “reckless, false and 
defamatory allegations against the husband and family members would have 
an effect of lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society and it 
amounts to cruelty.”  Similar observations were made by the  Coordinate 
Bench of this Court in the case of Rita vs. Jai Solanki  (2017)  SCC OnLine  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 14 of 19 
 Del 9078 and Nishi vs. Jagdish Ram  233 (2016) DLT 50.  
43. Thus, m aking of such false complaints can be termed as nothing but 
acts of mental cruelty.  
44. The persistent conduct of the respond ent has been repressive and 
oppressive towards the appellant, who in order to make the ir marriage work , 
had tolerated this behaviour for no less than 20 years. He made every 
endeavour to be able to cope with the cir cumstances ; to make the marriage 
work but  this long cruel conduct of the respondent, became unbearable for 
him when he admittedly attempted suicide on 25.10.2001 , by consuming 
poison. The respondent has also admitted that the appellant was taken to  
Safdarjung hospital , where he remain admitted.  
45. Independently, the individual incidents may seem to be innocuous and 
make it termed as a normal wear and tear  but when considered 
whol istically , it is evident  that such conduct created such pressure on the 
appellant  that eventually, he felt so co rnered an d unable to escape from this 
situation , that he even a ttempted  suicide. There could not have been a more 
blatant manifestation of his inability to sustain himself in such repressive 
and toxic environment  which was being suffered by the appellant . Such is 
the conduct of the respondent that no  person can reasonably be expected to 
put up with such conduct and to continue to live with the other party , as has 
been held in the Case of Veer Bhagat vs. Dheer Bhagat  (1994) 1 SCC 337.   
46. It is evident that the pervasi ve, blatant and latent conduct of the 
respondent , has had an injurious impact on the life of the appellant and 
caused trauma and mental agony to the mind of the appellant , entitling him 
to Divorce,  as has been held in the Case of Shobha Rani vs. Madhukar 
Reddy (1988) 1 SCC 105.         
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 15 of 19 
 47. The appellant had also deposed that he , from time to time, was 
compelled by the respondent , to give money to his brothers and mother. He 
had deposed that on 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/ - to 
Kanh aya Lal, broth er of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He 
also transferred Rs.30,000/ - in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt 
alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction 
that he was doing on his plot of land. He was c ompelled to give a sum of 
Rs.12,000/ - to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at 
Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also 
asked to pay Rs.50,000/ - to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother 
of the responde nt, at the time of the engagement of her daughter. The 
appellant refused to give money, which infuriated the respondent. Likewise, 
in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from G uwahati , he was forced 
to pay Rs.50,000/ -, at the time of the marriage of  another daughter, though 
he again refused. When the appellant came to Delhi on 29.07.2001, he was 
illegally detained and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/ -, through 
cheque.  
48. Another significant aspect which needs mention is that it is not 
disputed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat being No. 263, Pocket -3, 
Madhipur, New Delhi, was booked by the father of the appellant in his  
name, which was eventually allotted and possession  handed -over in the year 
1990 . The appellant along with the respondent, shi fted to the said flat but 
because of the respondent had been influenced by her mother and family 
members, did not stay in the flat and forced the appellant to sell the flat , to 
purchase the plot near her mother’s house. The appellant eventually sold the 
flat in the year 1992 and two adjoining plots measuring 100 square yards  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 16 of 19 
 and 50 square yards respectively , were purchased by the respondent , which 
were at a distance of about five kilometres , from the parental home of the 
respondent . The location and the cir cumstances as deposed by the appellant , 
reinforce his testimony of he being compelled to sell the flat , to be nearer to 
the parental home of the respondent.  
49. The appellant had deposed that he raised construction on the plot  and 
shifted there in the year 19 92. The appellant had further deposed that in the 
year 1997, the respondent insisted that the house constructed on 100 square 
yards plot , be transferred in her name. When the appellant refused, he was 
threatened with false implication in criminal case by leaving a note 
implicating him by blaming him for her committing suicide.  
50.  The respondent significantly has admitted that a portion of the 
property bearing No. C -46, Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, near IGNOU , Delhi, 
was transferred in her name. She tried to giv e an explanation that the 
appellant had done the same to save income -tax and denied the suggestion 
that the appellant transferred the said property in her name on her threat of 
false implication in a criminal case . The admissions of the respondent in her 
cross-examination further reinforce s the testimony of the appellant that he 
had been compelled to transfer a portion of his property , in the name of the 
respondent.  
51. In the circumstances, one can only appreciate  the resilience and the 
tenacity  of the appell ant who continue d to endeavour to live in this 
matrimonial relationship though he was subjected to such anguish and 
mental cruelty on a regular basis because of the conduct of the respondent.  
52. The parties have separated in the year 2004 ; the appellant has 
explained that the respondent left the matrimonial home in March, 2004  but  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 17 of 19 
 she came back in May, 2004 and threw out the appellant from his own 
house. To the contrary, t he respondent has asserted that the appellant himself 
left the matrimonial home in May , 2004. While she has asserted  so, she has 
failed to give any explanation s of the circumstances of separation in the year 
2004 , either in her affidavit of evidence or by way of suggestion to the 
appellant, in the cross -examination. On the other hand , the appe llant has 
been categorical in stating that the respondent herself left the matrimonial 
home in March, 2004  after she had filed a false complaint against him in 
Police Station , Mehrauli  in which he  was detained by the police for the 
whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on 
two to three blank  papers . There is not a whisper of word on behalf of the 
respondent , to explain the circumstances of separation.  
53. Her testimony has been conspicuous by silence in explaining if she 
ever made any endeavour  or effort to join back the company of the 
appellant.  On the other hand, the appellant has explained the conduct of the 
respondent over a period of about twenty years , which had made it 
extremely  oppressive for him to continue in the matrimonial  relationship.  
The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is the respondent, who has 
not been able to explain the circumstances as to why the appellant  left the 
house. Rather, the evidence and the admissions of the respondent establish 
that t he appellant has always discharged his matrimonial obligations towards 
the respondent and her family.  Such deprivation  of conjugal relationship by 
the respondent since the year 2004 , with no effort of re -conciliation , is the 
ultimate act of rejection of th e matrimonial relationship amounting to the 
extreme cruelty  to which a man can be subjected , warranting dissolution of 
the marriage , as held by the Apex Court in the case of Samar Ghogh v. Jaya  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 18 of 19 
 Ghosh  (2007) 4 SCC 511.  
54. In the recent case of Rakesh Raman vs.  Kavita , 2023 SCC OnLine SC 
497, it was observed that long separation and absence of cohabitation along 
with the complete breakdown of meaningful bonds of matrimony, has to be 
read as cruelty. It was further observed that the continuation of such a 
marriag e would only mean giving a sanction of cruelty which the respondent 
has been inflicting on the appellant.   
55.   From the aforesaid discussion, it  may be concluded that the 
respondent since the day of the marriage, had initially a problem of settling 
in the vi llage . Subsequently, on shifting to Delhi, she under the influence of 
her mother and family members, compelled the appellant  from time to time , 
to give money to her and the family members. It has also emerged that the 
appellant  had been prevailed to sell h is flat to buy property, clos er to the 
house of the respondent’s parents. Such was the influence of the family of 
the respondent on her that she essentially was dicta ted in her conduct by the 
family members. She went to the extent of lodging three complain ts in a 
span of 20 years , against the appellant  but has not been able to prove even 
an iota of truth in her complaints. Despite such adversity, the appellant had 
admittedly all throughout discharge d his obligations as a husband and a 
father and had provide d for  all the financial and other needs of the 
respondent  and his sons and had supported  them all thr ough  out. In these 
circumstances, it has to be concluded that the appellant made all endeavours, 
which lasted for 20 years to bring in matrimonial harmony and peace , but 
failed miserably.  
56. In view of above, we are of the considered opinion that the  acts of 
respondent can only be termed as acts of cruelty entitling the appellant to a  
MAT. APP. (F.C.) 84/2017           Page 19 of 19 
 decree of divorce , on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) ( ia) of the  
Hindu Marriage Act.   
57. We hereby set aside the impugned judgment dated  15.03.2017 . The 
Appeal is hereby allowed and the divorce on the ground of cruelty under 
Section 13 (1) ( ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act , is granted . 
58. The decree sheet be prepared accordingl y.

HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURESH KUMAR KAIT
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA

     J U D G M E N T  
NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
1. The present appeal under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 has been preferred by the appellant against the Judgment dated 15.03.2017, passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Delhi vide which the divorce Petition bearing HMA No. 61511/2016/04 under Section 13(1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, 1955), filed by the appellant/husband, has been dismissed. 
2. Briefly stated, the parties got married, according to Hindu Customs and Rites on 15.03.1983, when the appellant was 24 years and the respondent was 20 years of age. They resided as husband and wife at Kutopur, Rewari (Haryana) and from their wedlock, three sons were born on 07.06.1984, 16.07.1985 and 17.03.1987, respectively.
3. The case of the appellant is that he treated his wife with love and affection and provided her with all the comforts of life but within 2 to 3 months of the marriage, the appellant discovered that she had indifferent habits, was of a temperamental nature and would get instigated on petty matters at the instance of her parents, who caused unnecessary interference in their married life. She insulted, abused and misbehaved with him and his parents, in the presence of relatives, friends and neighbours, despite the fact that he always treated her with great affection. He took care of her during the three pregnancies and made all efforts to persuade the respondent to live as a devoted wife, but all his efforts went in vain. The respondent used to extort money from him at the behest of her parents and when he did not fulfil her demands, she lodged false complaints against him, based on concocted facts, only to harass him and to compel him to accede to her motivated demands. 
4. The appellant had asserted that they had a simple marriage, after which they started residing in his native village home in Kutopur, Rewari (Haryana) till 1986. The respondent had no interest in residing in the village and upon her insistence, the appellant shifted to her parents house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt. along with their entire belongings. 
5. Admittedly, the father of the respondent had been living separately from his wife, since prior to the marriage of the appellant with respondent. He had been residing with the two younger brothers of the respondent, at Delhi Cantt. Sagarpur, while the mother of the respondent was residing   with her elder brother, at Kalu Sarai Begum Pur, Near LIT., New Delhi. The appellant had asserted that because of the pressure tactics of the respondent, he was compelled to remain at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., in the parental home of the respondent, till 1988.
6. According to the appellant, he continued to bear the entire household expenses, despite which the respondent misbehaved and manhandled the appellant and made his life a hell.
7. The appellant further asserted that the respondent had no interest in his relatives and had refused to attend the marriage of his younger brother, at the native village. Piqued by the insistence of the appellant, the respondent left the house at Nagal Raya and went to live with her mother at Begum Pur, Delhi, without giving any information and without the knowledge of the appellant. She even made a false complaint against him, at his village address. 
8. The appellant has asserted that on returning from his native village after attending his brothers marriage, he shifted to rented accommodation at Chirag Delhi, in the year 1988, where he stayed for about one and a half years till 1990. It was only after great persuasion that the respondent joined his company, even though an inquiry was conducted against him on the complaint that had been filed by her. However, the complaint was eventually closed. 
9. The appellant had further disclosed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat of DDA was booked by his father which was allotted to him and the possession was delivered in the year 1990. The appellant shifted with the respondent to the said flat but on the instigation of her family, he was forced to sell the flat and buy two plots of land measuring 100 square yards and 50 square yards, in Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, Delhi.
10. The appellant has further asserted that while he was residing in Chirag Delhi, the mother of the respondent was constructing her house and the appellant was compelled to contribute Rs.15,000/-, in order to maintain cordial relationship with the respondent as the mother-in-law was not financially sound. However, despite doing all this, the respondent and her mother, without any prior information, took their belongings from the rented house and shifted to the house of the mother. Even thereafter, the appellant along with the respondent resided in the mothers house for about two months till March 1991.
11. He further asserted that from time to time, he was compelled to give money to the brother of the respondent and her family. On 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, brother of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He also transferred Rs.30,000/- in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his plot of land. He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also asked to pay Rs.50,000/- to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of the engagement of her daughter but when the appellant refused to give money, it infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from Guwahati, he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/-, at the time of the marriage of another daughter. Even though he again refused to give the money, he was illegally detained when he came to Delhi on 29.07.2001 and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- through cheque, to the respondent. 
12. The appellant has further submitted that he was transferred to Guwahati in August, 1988, where he resided till March 2001. Meanwhile, the appellant came to Delhi in March, 2000, for a few days but was shocked to learn that the respondent was having contact and relations with one Mahesh Kumar, who had earlier assaulted the appellant and against whom, the FIR had been registered. Upon being confronted, the respondent extended threats to the appellant that he would face serious consequences. 
13. The appellant had further asserted that the respondent had pressurised him to transfer the house/plot measuring 50 square yards, with a structure thereon, in the name of the respondent and when he refused, she threatened him with implication in false case and also made a false complaint containing baseless and fabricated allegations against him, his parents and other relatives in Crime against Women Cell, Nanakpura, Delhi, though, it was subsequently consigned to the Record Room. 
14. On 18.10.2001, Padam Singh, the brother of the respondent along with his associates, entered the house of the appellant and physically assaulted him and damaged the property, since he was not willing to yield to the uncalled demands and dictates of the respondent. It is asserted that because of such cruelties committed upon him by the respondent and her family members, he became completely depressed and tried to commit suicide by consuming poison and was taken to Safdarjung Hospital, where he was admitted. 
15. It is further asserted that the appellant continued to discharge his obligations and paid substantial amount of his salary to the respondent, for the expenses of the household and also paid various household items. He paid various amounts to the respondent regularly, since December, 2003 and aside from such regular payments, he deposited Rs.50,000/- by way of Fixed Deposit, in her name. He even earlier had being depositing cash in her account in the year 2001. He even purchased the LIC polices, in the name of the respondent and their sons for Rs.1,00,000/- each, for which he has been regularly paying the premium. The appellant paid the entire salary to the respondent but requested her to give him Rs.200/- for the pocket expenses but she created a scene and abused and manhandled the appellant and lodged a false complaint in Police Post Maidangarhi, Police Station; Mehrauli. The appellant was detained in the Police Post for the whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. On 24.03.2004, when he returned from the Police Post, the respondent left him. 
16. According to the appellant, in May 2004, on two to three occasion, an attempt was made by the respondent, to force him to accompany her to a nearby jungle but the appellant fearing from foul play desisted from going with her, which antagonised the respondent. On 29.05.2004, another attempt to murder and kidnap him was made by her along with the brothers, namely, Padam Singh and Kanhiya Lal, which again caused immense mental cruelty, tension and agony to him. 
17. He asserted that he had been treated with utmost physical and mental cruelty for the last 20 years. She even lodged a false complaint in CAW Cell, New Delhi and made baseless allegations against him. He filed his detailed reply and endeavour was also made by the respondent to get him thrown out of his house, which he had built with his heart and all the money. The respondent also made complaints in his Department to the superior officers and colleagues only with an intention to defame him.       
18. The appellant, thus sought divorce on the ground of cruelty. 
19. The petition was contested by the respondent, who denied all the allegations made against her by the appellant. The respondent had claimed in her Written Statement that the entire case of the appellant, was based on false allegations. She denied that she ever treated the appellant with cruelty and asserted that it was she, who has been deserted by the appellant, on 03.05.2004. She claimed that the divorce petition was liable to be dismissed. 
20. The issues from the pleadings, were framed on 19.12.2007, as under:-
(i)		Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty, as alleged, after the solemnization of the marriage OPP

(ii)	Relief.

21. The appellant appeared as PW-1. He also examined PW-2, Ms. Meena Kumari, Record Keeper from Delhi Commission for Women, Vikas Bhawan, ITO, Delhi, CAW Cell, to prove the complaints dated 27.07.2001, 02.04.2004 and the Letter dated 08.08.2001, purportedly written by the Delhi Legislator, forwarding the complaints to the DCW for enquiries. PW-3 Sh. Sukesh Kumar, H.G.A. from LIC of India, produced the records of the LIC Policies, taken for the benefit of the children, in the name of the respondent. PW-4, Sh. Ajaib Singh, Engineer Asstt. to S.S.W. (Civil I) CCW All India Radio, produced the nomination form, submitted by the appellant, with the Department. PW-5 Sh. Raj Kumar Barwal, Deputy Manager, PNB IGNOU Branch, produced the statement of account of the appellant. 
22. The respondent appeared as RW-1 and examined her son as RW-2, Sh. Kulbhushan Kumar.
23. The learned Principal Judge, Family Courts, on the basis of the entire evidence, concluded that the appellant was unable to discharge the burden to prove that he had been subjected to such form of cruelty that gave a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it would be harmful or detrimental for him to reside with the respondent. It was observed that in the first seven years of their marriage, they were blessed with three sons and there was no evidence whatsoever to show how the appellant was being subjected to cruelty by the respondent. There was no cogent evidence to prove that the respondent had failed to discharge her duties as a wife or as a mother. Bald allegations were made by the appellant, which were found to be not substantiated by any cogent evidence. The averments of the appellant that she used to make sarcastic remarks and called him chasmuddin, andha (blind) and githu, were also found to be of no consequence. It was observed that such allegations were for the first time made in the                    cross-examination by the appellant. 
24. It was further observed that there was no cogent evidence of the money having been given to the mother-in-law or the brother-in-law. 
25. The complaint dated 15.02.1998 Ex-PW-2/D lodged by the respondent with DCP Women Cell, Delhi, wherein the respondent had alleged that the appellant had tried to kill her and her three children by pouring kerosene, was held to be not proved. Likewise, the second complaint dated 27.10.2001, made in DCW and the third complaint dated 02.04.2004 in DCW, Delhi, were found to have not been pursued and closed. 
26. It was also held that the story of attempted suicide by the appellant on 25.10.2001, cannot be attributed to any act or omission of the respondent. Ld. Judge, Family Court thus, concluded  that the appellant had failed to prove that the respondent had committed any kind of cruelty and the petition for divorce was dismissed. 
27. Aggrieved, the appellant/husband has preferred the present Appeal. 
28. Submissions heard and the record perused.
29. The first aspect which emerges from the testimony of the parties, is that the appellant, who was a Civil Engineer in the Government service, had been providing for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, throughout the period, that they were together. 
30. Pertinently, the respondent had filed an affidavit of evidence, where she had merely claimed that the appellant had not paid anything to maintain the family and miserably neglected to perform his duties as husband and a disciplined father and that the future of the three sons got spoiled because of the negligence of the appellant. The respondent has however, admitted in her cross-examination that the appellant provided money for their livelihood, though she claimed that it was only a minimum amount to meet their daily expenses. She has further admitted that the appellant used to give money for her personal expenses, though again, she tried to qualify by saying that he used to take back the money. She also admitted that he had taken LIC Policies in her name as well as their children, for which he was paying the instalments and also admitted that she had received Rs.40,000/-, for the two LIC Policies. All her admissions, show that the appellant had been a caring husband and had provided for all the requirements of the respondent and the children, as per his means. 
31. It is further not in dispute that, for the first three years of the marriage, 1983 till 1986, the parties resided at the parental home of the appellant in Rewari.  The appellant has explained that since his job was in Delhi, he was commuting on the regular basis to his place of work. According to the appellant, the respondent wanted to reside in Delhi and had no interest to reside in a village and because of her constant insistence, they shifted to her parents house at Nagal Raya, Delhi Cantt., where the father was residing along with his two sons i.e. the brothers of the respondent. The mother, however, had been living separately with the third brother of the respondent at Kalu Sarai Begampur, New Delhi. There is no challenge that the parties resided at Nagal Raya, till 1988. 
32. The appellant had asserted that in the year 1988, he had gone to attend the wedding of his younger brother at the native village, to which the respondent refused to accompany. However, on his return, he was shocked to find that without informing him, the respondent had shifted to her mothers house at Begumpur, Delhi. 
33. She also filed a false complaint against him at the native village address. Pertinently, the respondent has deposed nothing about this incident in her affidavit of evidence but has admitted in her cross-examination that she had a quarrel with the appellant and that he had beaten her with the fry pan and that she suffered injury on her teeth. However, she admits that she did not file any complaint to the Police, in regard to this incident. Though the respondent claimed to have been beaten up by the appellant but aside from her bald claims in her cross-examination, there is no other evidence of mal-treatment by the appellant, on record. 
34. The respondent in her cross-examination, admitted having made a complaint Ex-PW-2/D, to DCP Women Cell, Delhi, in the year 1988. Significantly, she narrates nothing in her testimony about the alleged cruelty which compelled her to make this complaint, but the perusal of the complaint shows that she made serious allegations of the appellant attempting to kill her and the three sons by pouring kerosene on them. There is no evidence that any follow-up action got taken on the said complaint. Though serious allegations have been made against the appellant but the same have not only been denied by the appellant but also not proved by the respondent.  
35. Though the parties continued to reside together despite their differences, but the respondent admittedly made another complaint dated 27.07.2001, which is exhibited as Ex-PW2/A, wherein she made allegations of illicit relationship of the appellant with some woman while he was posted in Assam. She volunteered in her cross-examination that these facts were disclosed to her by the appellant himself who stated that earlier the woman was involved with his boss Mr. D.K. Mishra, but thereafter, he had passed her on to the appellant. 
36. The backdrop of this allegation is that undisputedly, the appellant was a Central Government employee working with the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting as a Civil Engineer and had remained at Guwahati, from 1988 to 2001. The respondent in her cross-examination, claimed that she had made the said complaint because the appellant had beaten her seriously. From the admissions of the respondent herself, it is evident that she had no basis for making such allegations but she has been consistent in levelling such allegations against the appellant, without any basis. Even in her complaint to the police, she had been persistent in making these allegations. 
37. In addition to being beaten up by stick and danda out of the house at gali and mohalla, with threats to kill her, she even made allegation that the appellant with the support of Laxmi Narain Sagar, his mamaji and Dharamvati Sagar, mamiji, conspired to kill her. She went on to state that many a times, he left the gas cylinder open in the kitchen while he himself came out, with an intent to burn her. So much so, he did not sleep in the house but forced her to sleep, which gave rise to an apprehension in her mind that he wanted to kill her, in her sleep. She even made allegations against the Mama and Mami of the appellant by asserting that they used to claim about their daughter and son-in-law being lawyers and their in-laws being Magistrate and that whatever she may do, she would be thrown on the fork of the road. All these allegations made in the complaint, have not been even mentioned by her, in her Written Statement or in her testimony. She has also miserably failed to prove the truth of any of these serious allegations made against the appellant. 
38. The matter did not end here because she made a third complaint dated 02.04.2004, Ex-PW-2/B, to Delhi Commission for Women, Delhi, alleging that while the appellant was in Guwahati, one contractor, Sh. Damodar Aggarwal and some people residing in Assam, together started blackmailing her and she wrote to the Department to transfer him back to Delhi. However, her husband started fighting with her regularly and had been telling her that the colony where they were residing, was not good and that they would sell the house and shift to some other area. On 24th March, 2004 he in the middle of the night, demanded the documents of the property and started breaking the lock of the almirah with the hammer and when she tried to prevent the appellant, he tried to hit her with the hammer on her head but was prevented by their elder son. He even tried to strangulate her but she was able to escape and get out of the house. She then called the Police at Number 100 and the police arrived and they were taken to police post Maidangarhi. While she and her son were sent back, the appellant was detained in the Police Post. She felt that she had not got any justice and therefore, made the complaint.
39.  Significantly, here also not only has she made allegations of physical beatings by the appellant but also of his greed for the property documents. But again, in her affidavit of evidence, not a word has been spoken by her. While the appellant had deposed about this complaint in his testimony, but pertinently, there is no cogent cross-examination done on this complaint by the respondent. In her own testimony as well, she has not explained any of the allegations that have been made in the said complaint. 
40. It is more than evident from the evidence on record that the respondent has been making irresponsible complaints not only of being subjected to physical cruelty by the appellant but even of illicit relationship of the appellant, with some woman. 
41. In the case of K. Srinivas Vs. K. Sunita X (2014) SLT 126. the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that filing of the false complaint against the husband and his family members also constitutes mental cruelty for the purpose of Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 
42. Along similar lines, the Supreme Court in the case of Ravi Kumar vs. Julmidevi (2010) 4 SCC 476 has categorically held that reckless, false and defamatory allegations against the husband and family members would have an effect of lowering their reputation in the eyes of the society and it amounts to cruelty. Similar observations were made by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Rita vs. Jai Solanki (2017) SCC OnLine Del 9078 and Nishi vs. Jagdish Ram 233 (2016) DLT 50.
43. Thus, making of such false complaints can be termed as nothing but acts of mental cruelty.
44. The persistent conduct of the respondent has been repressive and oppressive towards the appellant, who in order to make their marriage work, had tolerated this behaviour for no less than 20 years. He made every endeavour to be able to cope with the circumstances; to make the marriage work but this long cruel conduct of the respondent, became unbearable for him when he admittedly attempted suicide on 25.10.2001, by consuming poison. The respondent has also admitted that the appellant was taken to Safdarjung hospital, where he remain admitted. 
45. Independently, the individual incidents may seem to be innocuous and make it termed as a normal wear and tear but when considered wholistically, it is evident  that such conduct created such pressure on the appellant that eventually, he felt so cornered and unable to escape from this situation, that he even attempted suicide. There could not have been a more blatant manifestation of his inability to sustain himself in such repressive and toxic environment which was being suffered by the appellant. Such is the conduct of the respondent that no  person can reasonably be expected to put up with such conduct and to continue to live with the other party, as has been held in the Case of Veer Bhagat vs. Dheer Bhagat (1994) 1 SCC 337. 
46. It is evident that the pervasive, blatant and latent conduct of the respondent, has had an injurious impact on the life of the appellant and caused trauma and mental agony to the mind of the appellant, entitling him to Divorce, as has been held in the Case of Shobha Rani vs. Madhukar Reddy (1988) 1 SCC 105.       
47. The appellant had also deposed that he, from time to time, was compelled by the respondent, to give money to his brothers and mother. He had deposed that on 02.04.1996, he was compelled to pay Rs.20,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, brother of the respondent, on the occasion of his marriage. He also transferred Rs.30,000/- in the account of her elder brother, Som Dutt alias Gopal, to help him in meeting the expenses of additional construction that he was doing on his plot of land. He was compelled to give a sum of Rs.12,000/- to Kanhaya Lal, to help him to purchase a plot of land at Dehradun, in the name of the respondent. In the year 2000, he was also asked to pay Rs.50,000/- to Sona Devi, wife of Som Dutt, deceased brother of the respondent, at the time of the engagement of her daughter. The appellant refused to give money, which infuriated the respondent. Likewise, in the year 2001, when the appellant returned from Guwahati, he was forced to pay Rs.50,000/-, at the time of the marriage of another daughter, though he again refused. When the appellant came to Delhi on 29.07.2001, he was illegally detained and was forced to give a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-, through cheque. 
48. Another significant aspect which needs mention is that it is not disputed that in the year 1979, a LIG Flat being No. 263, Pocket-3, Madhipur, New Delhi, was booked by the father of the appellant in his  name, which was eventually allotted and possession  handed-over in the year 1990. The appellant along with the respondent, shifted to the said flat but because of the respondent had been influenced by her mother and family members, did not stay in the flat and forced the appellant to sell the flat, to purchase the plot near her mothers house. The appellant eventually sold the flat in the year 1992 and two adjoining plots measuring 100 square yards and 50 square yards respectively, were purchased by the respondent, which were at a distance of about five kilometres, from the parental home of the respondent. The location and the circumstances as deposed by the appellant, reinforce his testimony of he being compelled to sell the flat, to be nearer to the parental home of the respondent. 
49. The appellant had deposed that he raised construction on the plot and shifted there in the year 1992. The appellant had further deposed that in the year 1997, the respondent insisted that the house constructed on 100 square yards plot, be transferred in her name. When the appellant refused, he was threatened with false implication in criminal case by leaving a note implicating him by blaming him for her committing suicide.
50.  The respondent significantly has admitted that a portion of the property bearing No. C-46, Indira Enclave, Neb Sarai, near IGNOU, Delhi, was transferred in her name. She tried to give an explanation that the appellant had done the same to save income-tax and denied the suggestion that the appellant transferred the said property in her name on her threat of false implication in a criminal case. The admissions of the respondent in her cross-examination further reinforces the testimony of the appellant that he had been compelled to transfer a portion of his property, in the name of the respondent. 
51. In the circumstances, one can only appreciate the resilience and the tenacity of the appellant who continued to endeavour to live in this matrimonial relationship though he was subjected to such anguish and mental cruelty on a regular basis because of the conduct of the respondent.
52. The parties have separated in the year 2004; the appellant has explained that the respondent left the matrimonial home in March, 2004 but she came back in May, 2004 and threw out the appellant from his own house. To the contrary, the respondent has asserted that the appellant himself left the matrimonial home in May, 2004. While she has asserted so, she has failed to give any explanations of the circumstances of separation in the year 2004, either in her affidavit of evidence or by way of suggestion to the appellant, in the cross-examination. On the other hand, the appellant has been categorical in stating that the respondent herself left the matrimonial home in March, 2004 after she had filed a false complaint against him in Police Station, Mehrauli in which he was detained by the police for the whole night and was let off in the next morning, after being made to sign on two to three blank papers. There is not a whisper of word on behalf of the respondent, to explain the circumstances of separation. 
53. Her testimony has been conspicuous by silence in explaining if she ever made any endeavour or effort to join back the company of the appellant. On the other hand, the appellant has explained the conduct of the respondent over a period of about twenty years, which had made it extremely oppressive for him to continue in the matrimonial relationship. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is the respondent, who has not been able to explain the circumstances as to why the appellant left the house. Rather, the evidence and the admissions of the respondent establish that the appellant has always discharged his matrimonial obligations towards the respondent and her family. Such deprivation of conjugal relationship by the respondent since the year 2004, with no effort of re-conciliation, is the ultimate act of rejection of the matrimonial relationship amounting to the extreme cruelty to which a man can be subjected, warranting dissolution of the marriage, as held by the Apex Court in the case of Samar Ghogh v. Jaya Ghosh (2007) 4 SCC 511.
54. In the recent case of Rakesh Raman vs. Kavita, 2023 SCC OnLine SC 497, it was observed that long separation and absence of cohabitation along with the complete breakdown of meaningful bonds of matrimony, has to be read as cruelty. It was further observed that the continuation of such a marriage would only mean giving a sanction of cruelty which the respondent has been inflicting on the appellant. 
55.   From the aforesaid discussion, it may be concluded that the respondent since the day of the marriage, had initially a problem of settling in the village. Subsequently, on shifting to Delhi, she under the influence of her mother and family members, compelled the appellant from time to time, to give money to her and the family members. It has also emerged that the appellant had been prevailed to sell his flat to buy property, closer to the house of the respondents parents. Such was the influence of the family of the respondent on her that she essentially was dictated in her conduct by the family members. She went to the extent of lodging three complaints in a span of 20 years, against the appellant but has not been able to prove even an iota of truth in her complaints. Despite such adversity, the appellant had admittedly all throughout discharged his obligations as a husband and a father and had provided for all the financial and other needs of the respondent and his sons and had supported them all through out. In these circumstances, it has to be concluded that the appellant made all endeavours, which lasted for 20 years to bring in matrimonial harmony and peace, but failed miserably. 
56. In view of above, we are of the considered opinion that the acts of respondent can only be termed as acts of cruelty entitling the appellant to a decree of divorce, on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act. 
57. We hereby set aside the impugned judgment dated 15.03.2017. The Appeal is hereby allowed and the divorce on the ground of cruelty under Section 13 (1) (ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act, is granted.
58. The decree sheet be prepared accordingly.

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.  
Unfortunate are the matrimonial disputes where the fountain head of 
friction inter se  the spouses is mere lack of adjustment, unders tanding 
and the will to stay together. These factors are the wheels of the char iot 
of a workable marriage and if either spouse becomes   averse  to mov e 
together  and chooses to abandon the relationship, then extensive 
reconciliatory efforts by one spouse, would also not yield any results.   
1. The present Appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 
1955 (hereinafter referred to as “HMA, 1955” ) has been filed on behalf of 
the appellant/husband assailing the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01 .2009

2. The facts in brief as narrated by the appellant/husband  (who was 
the petitioner in the Divorce Petition ), are that the ap pellant/husband got 
married to the respondent/wife according to the Hind u customs and rites on 
16.04. 1994  at Delhi . One daughter was born from their wedlock on 
12.08.1995.   
3. According to the appellant  the respondent/wife (who was the 
respondent in the Divor ce Petition ) started misbehaving within 2 -3 days of 
the marriage and started making demands  for a separate accommodation.  It 
is claimed that the appellant/husband was subjected to various acts of cruelty 
by the respondent by refusing to participate in the  festivals such as 
Janamasthmi  and rejecting the gifts given by the appellant claiming them to 
be cheap.  The appellant/husband has further asserted that the 
respondent/wife again made a demand for a separate kitchen on 12.02.1995 
and an oral settlement was  entered into between the parties on 13.02.1995  
4. In March, 1995, the respondent/wife locked herself in the room and 
refused to open the door and such erratic behaviour caused grave mental 
agony to the appellant/husband.  
5. The appellant/husband has asserted t hat the father of the 
respondent/ wife called him to this office and questioned him as to why the 
respondent/wife was not wearing ornaments at the time of Kirtan  held in the 
house of the appellant/husband.    
6. It was further asserted that the  respondent/wife  was employed as a 
Teacher in the Municipal Corporation School at Patel Nagar, New Delhi  and 
he made every effort to get the transfer of the respondent/wife to Geeta 
Colony. She  had left the matrimonial home and had gone to her parental  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 3 of 14 
 home for enjoying s ummer vacations in May,1995 while she  was in family 
way.  The respondent/wife was admitted in the St. Stephan Hospital  on 10 -
11.06.1995 , where she misbehaved with the appellant/husband and his 
family members in the Hospital . Post discharge from the Hospita l after 3 -4 
days, she went  to the parental home instead of coming back to the 
matrimonial home.  
7. On 29.06.1995, the respondent/wife rejoined her school after the 
summer vacations were over, but instead of returning to the matrimonial 
home, she went to resid e with her Mausi , where she resided till 15.07.1995 . 
During that period, both the appellant/husband and the respondent/wife were 
searching for a rental accommodation, but she did not approve of any 
accommodation. Ultimately, the respondent/wife left her Mausi’s  house and 
went  to reside in her parental home and since then she refused to entertain 
the phone calls of the appellant/husband.   
8. The respondent/wife got admitted at St. Stephan Hospital where she 
gave birth to a daughter on 12.08.1995.  The appellan t/husband and his 
family members visited the respondent/wife in the Hospital, but the brother 
of the respondent/wife misbehaved with them.  It was mutually agreed  that 
post her delivery, she would  resid e in her parental home for 40 days and 
thereafter, she  would join  the appellant/husband in their separate 
accommodation.  Thus, t he appellant/husband took a rented accommodation 
in September, 1995 at Krishan Nagar, Delhi. However, t he respondent/wife 
joined her duty after her maternity leave, but still she did  not join the 
company of the appellant/husband at the rented accommodation.  
9. It is submitted that the respondent/wife and her father in the first week 
of November, 1995 even went to the house of the matrimonial home of the  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 4 of 14 
 appellant/husband ’s sister and th ey misbehaved with the appellant/husband 
which caused great mental agony  to him.  
10. The appellant/husband has also asserted that the respondent/wife had 
visited the office of appellant/husband and shouted at him in the presence of 
his boss.    On 24.11.1995,  the respondent/wife again came to the office of 
appellant/husband and met the Joint Secretary , Ms. Rewa Nayyar  and on h er 
request, the appellant/husband accompanied the respondent/wife  in a TSR  to 
go to their home , but the respondent/wife directed the  TSR to Police Station , 
Tilak Nagar to get the appellant/husband arrested.  In order to save himself, 
the appellant/husband had to jump out of the TSR  and escape . 
11. The appellant/husband thus contended that the respondent/wife has 
been residing away from him since May , 1995 and has refused to join his 
company even in the rented accommodation.  Hence, the divorce was sought 
on the ground of cruelty and desertion.   
12. The respondent/wife has contested the Divorce Petition  and in her 
Written Statement  took the prelimi nary objections that the Divorce Petition 
did not disclose any cause of action and that the appellant/husband himself 
was guilty of cruelty towards the respondent/wife.  
13. The respondent/wife, on merits , denied all the allegations made 
against  her and asserte d that she has always been a sincere and dutiful Hindu 
wife.  She claimed that while she was in advance stage of pregnancy, she 
was not permitted to l ive in her matrimonial home by her   in-laws and 
because out of the compulsion, the respondent/wife went t o stay in the house 
of her Mausi  temporarily.  
14. The respondent/wife often called the appellant/husband to take her 
back to the matrimonial home, but the appellant/husband had no interest.   
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 5 of 14 
 Therefore, the respondent/wife submitted that the Divorce Petition w as 
liable to be dismissed.  
15. On the pleadings, the issues were framed on  26.05.2003  which read as 
under: - 
“(i) Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with 
cruelty as alleged?  OPP  
 
(ii) Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner for 
conti nuous period of not less than two years immediately 
preceding the presentation of petition?  OPP  
 
(iii) Whether the petitioner is trying to take advantage of his 
own wrongs, if so, its effect?  OPR.  
 
(iv) Relief.”   
 
16. The appellant/husband appeared as PW1  and also examined 
PW2/ Rajinder Shah Singh, his family friend and PW3 /K.L. Sikka, the 
landlord of the premises which were taken on rent by the appellant/husband 
from October,  2000 till he came to seek divorce in the Court.  
17. The respondent/wife examined herself as RW1 . 
18. The learned Additional District Judge, referred  to the various 
incidents as narrated by the appellant/husband to conclude that it was the 
appellant/husband who compelled the respondent/wife to live separately and 
made no efforts whatsoever to bring  her back to the matrimonial home.  
Thus, it was concluded that the husband has not been able to substantiate 
any of the allegations and it was the appellant/husband who had committed 
the matrimonial wrong of d eserting his wife without any sufficient cause . 
Therefore, the Divorce Petition was dismissed.  
19. Aggrieved by the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009, the present 
Appeal has been preferred by the appellant/husband.   
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 6 of 14 
 20. Submissions heard from learned counsels for the parties and the 
documents as well as t he record perused.  
Cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia ) of HMA, 1955 :- 
21. Admitted ly, the parties got married on 1 6.04.1994 and from the 
pleading s, it is apparent that the differences arose inter se  the parties soon 
after their marriage.  
22. The respondent/wife ha d been living separately from 26.05 .1995 
which implies that the parties resid ed together for about 13  months and have 
been living separately for the last 30 years. Essentially, the acts of cruelty 
that were alleged by the appellant/husband to have been commit ted by the 
respondent/wife were that she had scant regard for the gifts that the 
appellant/husband gave on her birthday. The respondent/wife refused to 
participate in the festivals like Janmastami  and that she was insisting on a 
separate accommodation.   
23. None of these allegations as claimed by the appellant/husband were 
substantiated  and neither has he made any serious allegation, grave and 
weighty enough to grant divorce on the ground of cruelty which could cause 
reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant/husband that living 
with the wife is unsafe and harmful for him . The Learned Additional District 
Judge has rightly concluded that no acts of cruelty as envisaged under 
Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955 were proved by the appellant/husband ; 
rather th ey were incidents of normal wear and tear and minor initial 
adjustments.  
24. Accordingly, we concur with the findings of the Learned 
Additional District Judge and do find any infirmit y in the conclusions 
so arrived. T herefore , we observe that divorce petition  has rightly  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 7 of 14 
 dismissed by the Ld. ADJ under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955.  
 
Desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955 :- 
25. The appellant/husband had also sought the Divorce on the ground of 
desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955.  
26. The appellant had alleged that after their marriage on 16.04.1994 
there were adjustment issues and alleged cruelties ( though not proved as 
held above ) by the respondent.   
27. The appellant in his testimony had deposed that the respondent who 
was a teacher in MCD School , had gone to her parental home during her 
Summer vacations on 26.05.1995.  The respondent has countered it by 
asserting that in fact on that day she had gone along with the appellant for 
her regular check up to St. Stephens  Hospital, but the appellant instead  of 
bringing her back home after the check up , compelled her to go to her 
parental home.  While she was in her parental home, she was admitted in the 
St. Stephens Hospital on 10/11.6.1995, where she remained admitted for 3 -4 
days but neither the appellant nor his family members came to visit her.  She 
after being discharged, had no option but to go back to her parental home.  
Pertinently, all these facts have been admitted by the appellant in his cross -
examination.  
28.  It further emerges from the respective testimon y of the parties  that 
the school of the respondent re -opened on 29.06.1995 and admittedly she 
went to stay in the house of her maternal aunt.  The respondent had deposed 
that she was compelled to go to her maternal aunt’s house since the 
appellant w as not forthcoming in taking her to the matrimonial home.  
Whereas, t he appellant had asserted in his testimony that respondent herself  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 8 of 14 
 did not return to the matrimonial home , which in fact lends credence to the 
testimony of the respondent that appellant h ad no inclination to take her to 
the matrimonial home. Thus,  it is difficult to accept the contention of the 
appellant that the respondent voluntarily and without their being compelling 
circumstances, would prefer to go to stay in the house of her mausi  instead 
of coming to her matrimonial home.  
29. The respondent had further asserted that on 12.08.1995, on the birth 
of the daughter, neither the appellant nor his family members visited her and 
the hospital expenditure was also borne by her.  The appellant has admitted  
that he was not present in the hospital on the day she was discharged from 
the hospital.  The appellant in his cross -examination has admitted that he 
went to visit her only once in the Hospital and also that the hospital 
expenditure was borne by t he respondent , though he asserted that the same 
was reimbursed by her Department.  It thereby implies that he admittedly 
did not bear the hospital expenditure.   
30. Clearly, the circumstances support the truthfulness of the testimony of 
the respondent.  Admitte dly, since 26.05. 1995 the respondent has been 
staying either at the house of her mausi  and after the delivery she shifted to 
her parental home.  
31. Further, it is admitted by the appellant that prior to delivery of the 
child on 12.08.1995, the respondent alon g with one Mr. Malhotra had visited 
the office of the appellant where Mr. Sourabh, brother and Mr. Sanjay, 
brother -in-law of appellant were already present.  She has deposed that she 
was told by them in clear words that she would not be permitted to live i n 
the matrimonial home which caused her great mental agony resulting in pre -
mature delivery of the child on 12.08.1995 when in fact the date of delivery  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 9 of 14 
 was 26.08.1995.  
32.  That the  appellant  never had any inclination for the respondent to 
return to the matr imonial home is further reinforced from his blatant  
admis sion  in his cross -examination that  he never went to the house of the 
respondent after she was discharged from the hospital post delivery of the 
daughter .  His explanation for the respondent having g one to her parental 
home was that it was agreed that she would stay in her parental home post 
delivery for 40 days and thereafter they would shift to a rented 
accommodation.  While the appellant has claimed that there was an 
understanding of respondent goi ng to live in the parental home, but his own 
admissions that he was not present at the time of discharge of the respondent 
from the hospital , again corroborates the assertions of the respondent that 
appellant had  no interest, whatsoever, in  taking her ba ck to the matrimonial 
home.  
33. The appellant had tried to create a story of having taken the premises 
at Krishna Nagar on rent in September, 1995.  In support of his assertions , 
he has relied on a Rent  Deed Ex.PW1/C  executed between the landlord 
Manjeet Singh  and him self.  Interestingly , while according to the testimony 
of the appellant, he had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995, but 
this Rent  Deed is of November, 1999.  There is no mention in this Rent 
Deed that the appellant  had been in his premis es as a tenant since 1995.   
34. Pertinently, in his cross -examination he was asked to produce a proof 
of having paid rent for the accommodation allegedly taken on rent by him  
pursuant to the insistence of the respondent for separate residence , but he 
had no d ocument whatsoever in support thereof.  His Income Tax Returns 
were put to him where there was no mention of any rent having been paid by  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 10 of 14 
 him.  He also admitted that he had not given any intimation to his 
Department about taking of premises on rent.  The a ppellant has, therefore, 
not been able to establish that the respondent was insisting on a separate 
accommodation or that he to honour her wish , had taken the premises on 
rent in September, 1995.  Once, it is held that the appellant has not been able 
to pr ove that he ever taken any premises on rent in September, 1995, his 
further assertion that despite his intention of taking the respondent to the 
rented accommodation, she herself did not join him , becomes untruthful .  
The appellant has been only creating e vidence by producing a Rent 
Agreement which is also dated 18.11.1999 i.e. of almost four years since 
1995.   
35. Another interesting aspect which emerges from this Lease Deed 
Ex.PW1/C is Clause 7, which reads as under:  
“7. That it has been further agreed betwee n the parties that 
only the tenant/second party himself shall use the said 
tenanted premises under his occupation and no other person 
including his wife , mother, son or any other relation of the 
2nd party shall be entitled to use the said premises without the 
written permission of the 1st party/ landlord -owner.”  
 
36. The appellant has himself conceded to not taking his wife to the 
rented premises.  This further reinforces the testimony of the respondent that 
he never had any intention to take her to the matrimo nial home.  
37. The appellant himself has further deposed that in the first week of 
November, 1995 the respondent along with her father , visited the house of 
in-laws of his sister.  According to the respondent she had gone there with 
an endeavour to seek their intervention for reconciliation of inter -se 
differences between the appellant and the respondent and to convince the  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 11 of 14 
 appellant to take her back in the matrimonial home.  This incident has been 
explained by the respondent in her evidence wherein she has dep osed that as 
soon as she reached the house of the father -in-law of the sister of the 
appellant, the appellant and his brother reached there  and threw out the 
respondent and her father and even abused them.  
38. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation continued further 
when on 18.11.1995 , she met the Head of the Union of which the mother of 
the appellant was a member, but there also she did not succeed.   
39. The appellant in his affidavit of evidence has denied the visit of the 
respondent in the office on 11.08.1995, but admitted  that she with the small 
child , had come  to his office on 24.11.1995 and had met his Officer Ms. 
Reva Nayyar , Joint Secretary who counseled them both and told the 
appellant to take the respondent and the child , to his house.  It is admitted by 
the appellant that while they were on their way to his house in the TSR, he 
got out mid way and left.  The explanation given by him is that the 
respondent had directed the TSR driver to go to the Police Station to get him 
arrested and because o f the fear of getting arrested , he got off mid way.  The 
respondent on the other hand , has explained that after traveling barely 100 
meters , the appellant got the TSR stopped and went away because he did not 
want to take her to his house. This is also corr oborated by the fact that the 
appellant, had miserably failed to prove that he had taken separate premises 
on rent, as was asserted by him.   
40. The testimony of respondent that she persistently made efforts for 
reconciliation, emerges as  truthful because it i s an admitted fact that 
respondent never made any complaint to any Authority be it Police, Legal 
Aid or CAW Cell nor did she initiate any litigation till the divorce petition  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 12 of 14 
 was filed.   
41. It is obvious from the overwhelming evidence as discussed above, 
that the appellant had no inclination whatsoever to take her back with him . 
While he had been compelled by Senior Officer to take her along with him, 
he immediately deserted her mid way by getting out of the TSR.  The 
admissions of the appellant clearly refle ct that he never had any intention to 
take the respondent back to the matrimonial home and has not been able to 
explain any circumstance for his apprehension to le t the respondent be with 
him in his house.  
42. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation a nd to be able to go 
back to the matrimonial home did not end only with an endeavour to contact 
the superior Office of the appellant to intervene.   
43. She admittedly along with her father and brother , took a bus to 
Chandigarh to meet Mr. Kharbanda , maternal u ncle of the appellant who had 
influence on the family of the appellant , as admitted by him in cross -
examination.  Dr. Vinod Narang , cousin brother of appellant was also 
traveling  on the same bus .  The respondent has deposed that she had talked 
to Dr. Vinod  Narang on the way to Chandigarh, but he expressed his 
inability to be able to intervene in their matter because he felt that the family 
of the appellant would not pay heed to his advice.  She made all efforts by 
approaching the family members of the appel lant, but did not meet any 
success.   
44. Her efforts for reconciliation did not end there.  Admittedly, she 
continued her efforts and eventually a meeting was organized on 31.07.1997 
at the Clinic of Dr. Takkar , friend of the appellant’s father at Paschim Vih ar, 
Delhi.  A second meeting at the Clinic took place on 11.09.1997 but it did  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 13 of 14 
 not yield any result because as per the testimony of the respondent, the 
appellant and his father were absolutely adamant on not taking her to the 
matrimonial home.   
45. The entire  evidence , which is essentially not disputed but is admitted  
by the appellant thus, proves that the appellant at every point of time resisted 
the reconciliatory efforts made by the respondent and despite persistent 
efforts of the respondent did not permit her to join him in the matrimonial 
home.  The appellant has also not been able to explain the reason why he 
never went to meet the respondent or make any effort to bring her back.  
46. In order to be able to succeed to prove desertion, two ingredients are 
essen tial :  Factum Deserdendi and Animus Deserendi  i.e. the factum of 
separation, and the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end as 
held in the case of Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati 1956 
SCC OnLine SC 15.   
47. In the present case, the re is no evidence  whatsoever  to prove that the 
respondent had shifted out of the matrimonial home ; without any reasonable 
excuse rather it is established that the appellant compelled her to shift out  It 
is also not proved that the respondent had any animus  or intention to leave 
the matrimonial home.  The appellant has miserably failed to prove that 
the respondent had deserted the appellant. The appellant was thus, 
rightly denied divorce on the ground of Desertion under S.13 (1) (ib) of 
HMA, 1955 by the Ld. ADJ, Delhi.    
 
Conclusion :- 
48. We are conscious that this is a broken marriage where parties are 
residing separately for about 30 years and there is no possibility of reunion  
 MAT.APP.(F.C.) 298/2023   Page 14 of 14 
 between the parties. It is a case where the marriage is dead but in recognit ion 
of the principle under S.23 (1)(a) HMA,1955, to grant a Divorce in the 
present case would be to add a premium to the recalcitrant and unreasonable 
conduct of the appellant in unilaterally refusing to discharge his matrimonial 
obligations and has indeed caused undefinable cruelty to the respondent by 
denying her the conjugality without any fault.  
49. We hereby conclude from the aforesaid discussion that the divorce 
petition of the appellant on the ground of cruelty and desertion  under  
S.13(1)(ia) and (ib) HMA,1955 has been rightly dismissed by the learned 
Additional District Judge and does not call for any interference.  
50. The appeal is accordingly dismissed  with pending application(s), 
if any .

NEENA BANSAL KRISHNA, J.
Unfortunate are the matrimonial disputes where the fountain head of friction inter se the spouses is mere lack of adjustment, understanding and the will to stay together. These factors are the wheels of the chariot of a workable marriage and if either spouse becomes  averse to move together and chooses to abandon the relationship, then extensive reconciliatory efforts by one spouse, would also not yield any results.  
1. The present Appeal under Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as HMA, 1955) has been filed on behalf of the appellant/husband assailing the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009 vide which the Divorce Petition under Sections 13(1)(ia) and 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955 filed on behalf of the appellant/husband, has been dismissed. 
2. The facts in brief as narrated by the appellant/husband (who was the petitioner in the Divorce Petition), are that the appellant/husband got married to the respondent/wife according to the Hindu customs and rites on 16.04.1994 at Delhi. One daughter was born from their wedlock on 12.08.1995. 
3. According to the appellant the respondent/wife (who was the respondent in the Divorce Petition) started misbehaving within 2-3 days of the marriage and started making demands for a separate accommodation.  It is claimed that the appellant/husband was subjected to various acts of cruelty by the respondent by refusing to participate in the festivals such as Janamasthmi and rejecting the gifts given by the appellant claiming them to be cheap. The appellant/husband has further asserted that the respondent/wife again made a demand for a separate kitchen on 12.02.1995 and an oral settlement was entered into between the parties on 13.02.1995 
4. In March, 1995, the respondent/wife locked herself in the room and refused to open the door and such erratic behaviour caused grave mental agony to the appellant/husband.
5. The appellant/husband has asserted that the father of the respondent/wife called him to this office and questioned him as to why the respondent/wife was not wearing ornaments at the time of Kirtan held in the house of the appellant/husband.   
6. It was further asserted that the respondent/wife was employed as a Teacher in the Municipal Corporation School at Patel Nagar, New Delhi and he made every effort to get the transfer of the respondent/wife to Geeta Colony. She had left the matrimonial home and had gone to her parental home for enjoying summer vacations in May,1995 while she  was in family way. The respondent/wife was admitted in the St. Stephan Hospital on 10-11.06.1995, where she misbehaved with the appellant/husband and his family members in the Hospital. Post discharge from the Hospital after 3-4 days, she went to the parental home instead of coming back to the matrimonial home.
7. On 29.06.1995, the respondent/wife rejoined her school after the summer vacations were over, but instead of returning to the matrimonial home, she went to reside with her Mausi, where she resided till 15.07.1995. During that period, both the appellant/husband and the respondent/wife were searching for a rental accommodation, but she did not approve of any accommodation. Ultimately, the respondent/wife left her Mausis house and went to reside in her parental home and since then she refused to entertain the phone calls of the appellant/husband.  
8. The respondent/wife got admitted at St. Stephan Hospital where she gave birth to a daughter on 12.08.1995.  The appellant/husband and his family members visited the respondent/wife in the Hospital, but the brother of the respondent/wife misbehaved with them.  It was mutually agreed that post her delivery, she would reside in her parental home for 40 days and thereafter, she would join the appellant/husband in their separate accommodation. Thus, the appellant/husband took a rented accommodation in September, 1995 at Krishan Nagar, Delhi. However, the respondent/wife joined her duty after her maternity leave, but still she did not join the company of the appellant/husband at the rented accommodation. 
9. It is submitted that the respondent/wife and her father in the first week of November, 1995 even went to the house of the matrimonial home of the appellant/husbands sister and they misbehaved with the appellant/husband which caused great mental agony to him. 
10. The appellant/husband has also asserted that the respondent/wife had visited the office of appellant/husband and shouted at him in the presence of his boss.    On 24.11.1995, the respondent/wife again came to the office of appellant/husband and met the Joint Secretary, Ms. Rewa Nayyar and on her request, the appellant/husband accompanied the respondent/wife in a TSR to go to their home, but the respondent/wife directed the TSR to Police Station, Tilak Nagar to get the appellant/husband arrested.  In order to save himself, the appellant/husband had to jump out of the TSR and escape.
11. The appellant/husband thus contended that the respondent/wife has been residing away from him since May, 1995 and has refused to join his company even in the rented accommodation.  Hence, the divorce was sought on the ground of cruelty and desertion.  
12. The respondent/wife has contested the Divorce Petition and in her Written Statement took the preliminary objections that the Divorce Petition did not disclose any cause of action and that the appellant/husband himself was guilty of cruelty towards the respondent/wife.
13. The respondent/wife, on merits, denied all the allegations made against her and asserted that she has always been a sincere and dutiful Hindu wife.  She claimed that while she was in advance stage of pregnancy, she was not permitted to live in her matrimonial home by her   in-laws and because out of the compulsion, the respondent/wife went to stay in the house of her Mausi temporarily. 
14. The respondent/wife often called the appellant/husband to take her back to the matrimonial home, but the appellant/husband had no interest.  Therefore, the respondent/wife submitted that the Divorce Petition was liable to be dismissed. 
15. On the pleadings, the issues were framed on 26.05.2003 which read as under: -
(i)	Whether the respondent has treated the petitioner with cruelty as alleged?	OPP

(ii)	Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner for continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of petition?	OPP

(iii)	Whether the petitioner is trying to take advantage of his own wrongs, if so, its effect?	OPR.

(iv)	Relief.	

16. The appellant/husband appeared as PW1 and also examined PW2/Rajinder Shah Singh, his family friend and PW3/K.L. Sikka, the landlord of the premises which were taken on rent by the appellant/husband from October, 2000 till he came to seek divorce in the Court. 
17. The respondent/wife examined herself as RW1.
18. The learned Additional District Judge, referred to the various incidents as narrated by the appellant/husband to conclude that it was the appellant/husband who compelled the respondent/wife to live separately and made no efforts whatsoever to bring her back to the matrimonial home.  Thus, it was concluded that the husband has not been able to substantiate any of the allegations and it was the appellant/husband who had committed the matrimonial wrong of deserting his wife without any sufficient cause. Therefore, the Divorce Petition was dismissed. 
19. Aggrieved by the Judgment and Decree dated 07.01.2009, the present Appeal has been preferred by the appellant/husband. 
20. Submissions heard from learned counsels for the parties and the documents as well as the record perused. 
Cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955:-
21. Admittedly, the parties got married on 16.04.1994 and from the pleadings, it is apparent that the differences arose inter se the parties soon after their marriage.
22. The respondent/wife had been living separately from 26.05.1995 which implies that the parties resided together for about 13 months and have been living separately for the last 30 years. Essentially, the acts of cruelty that were alleged by the appellant/husband to have been committed by the respondent/wife were that she had scant regard for the gifts that the appellant/husband gave on her birthday. The respondent/wife refused to participate in the festivals like Janmastami and that she was insisting on a separate accommodation.  
23. None of these allegations as claimed by the appellant/husband were substantiated and neither has he made any serious allegation, grave and weighty enough to grant divorce on the ground of cruelty which could cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant/husband that living with the wife is unsafe and harmful for him. The Learned Additional District Judge has rightly concluded that no acts of cruelty as envisaged under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955 were proved by the appellant/husband; rather they were incidents of normal wear and tear and minor initial adjustments. 
24. Accordingly, we concur with the findings of the Learned Additional District Judge and do find any infirmity in the conclusions so arrived. Therefore, we observe that divorce petition has rightly dismissed by the Ld. ADJ under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA, 1955.

Desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955:-
25. The appellant/husband had also sought the Divorce on the ground of desertion under Section 13(1)(ib) of HMA, 1955. 
26. The appellant had alleged that after their marriage on 16.04.1994 there were adjustment issues and alleged cruelties (though not proved as held above) by the respondent.  
27. The appellant in his testimony had deposed that the respondent who was a teacher in MCD School, had gone to her parental home during her Summer vacations on 26.05.1995.  The respondent has countered it by asserting that in fact on that day she had gone along with the appellant for her regular check up to St. Stephens Hospital, but the appellant instead of bringing her back home after the check up, compelled her to go to her parental home.  While she was in her parental home, she was admitted in the St. Stephens Hospital on 10/11.6.1995, where she remained admitted for 3-4 days but neither the appellant nor his family members came to visit her.  She after being discharged, had no option but to go back to her parental home.  Pertinently, all these facts have been admitted by the appellant in his cross-examination. 
28.  It further emerges from the respective testimony of the parties that the school of the respondent re-opened on 29.06.1995 and admittedly she went to stay in the house of her maternal aunt.  The respondent had deposed that she was compelled to go to her maternal aunts house since the appellant was not forthcoming in taking her to the matrimonial home.  Whereas, the appellant had asserted in his testimony that respondent herself did not return to the matrimonial home, which in fact lends credence to the testimony of the respondent that appellant had no inclination to take her to the matrimonial home. Thus, it is difficult to accept the contention of the appellant that the respondent voluntarily and without their being compelling circumstances, would prefer to go to stay in the house of her mausi instead of coming to her matrimonial home. 
29. The respondent had further asserted that on 12.08.1995, on the birth of the daughter, neither the appellant nor his family members visited her and the hospital expenditure was also borne by her.  The appellant has admitted that he was not present in the hospital on the day she was discharged from the hospital.  The appellant in his cross-examination has admitted that he went to visit her only once in the Hospital and also that the hospital expenditure was borne by the respondent, though he asserted that the same was reimbursed by her Department.  It thereby implies that he admittedly did not bear the hospital expenditure. 
30. Clearly, the circumstances support the truthfulness of the testimony of the respondent. Admittedly, since 26.05.1995 the respondent has been staying either at the house of her mausi and after the delivery she shifted to her parental home. 
31. Further, it is admitted by the appellant that prior to delivery of the child on 12.08.1995, the respondent along with one Mr. Malhotra had visited the office of the appellant where Mr. Sourabh, brother and Mr. Sanjay, brother-in-law of appellant were already present.  She has deposed that she was told by them in clear words that she would not be permitted to live in the matrimonial home which caused her great mental agony resulting in pre-mature delivery of the child on 12.08.1995 when in fact the date of delivery was 26.08.1995.
32.  That the  appellant never had any inclination for the respondent to return to the matrimonial home is further reinforced from his blatant admission  in his cross-examination that he never went to the house of the respondent after she was discharged from the hospital post delivery of the daughter.  His explanation for the respondent having gone to her parental home was that it was agreed that she would stay in her parental home post delivery for 40 days and thereafter they would shift to a rented accommodation.  While the appellant has claimed that there was an understanding of respondent going to live in the parental home, but his own admissions that he was not present at the time of discharge of the respondent from the hospital, again corroborates the assertions of the respondent that appellant had  no interest, whatsoever, in  taking her back to the matrimonial home.
33. The appellant had tried to create a story of having taken the premises at Krishna Nagar on rent in September, 1995.  In support of his assertions, he has relied on a Rent Deed Ex.PW1/C executed between the landlord Manjeet Singh and himself.  Interestingly, while according to the testimony of the appellant, he had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995, but this Rent Deed is of November, 1999.  There is no mention in this Rent Deed that the appellant had been in his premises as a tenant since 1995.  
34. Pertinently, in his cross-examination he was asked to produce a proof of having paid rent for the accommodation allegedly taken on rent by him pursuant to the insistence of the respondent for separate residence, but he had no document whatsoever in support thereof.  His Income Tax Returns were put to him where there was no mention of any rent having been paid by him.  He also admitted that he had not given any intimation to his Department about taking of premises on rent.  The appellant has, therefore, not been able to establish that the respondent was insisting on a separate accommodation or that he to honour her wish, had taken the premises on rent in September, 1995.  Once, it is held that the appellant has not been able to prove that he ever taken any premises on rent in September, 1995, his further assertion that despite his intention of taking the respondent to the rented accommodation, she herself did not join him, becomes untruthful.  The appellant has been only creating evidence by producing a Rent Agreement which is also dated 18.11.1999 i.e. of almost four years since 1995. 
35. Another interesting aspect which emerges from this Lease Deed Ex.PW1/C is Clause 7, which reads as under:
7. That it has been further agreed between the parties that only the tenant/second party himself shall use the said tenanted premises under his occupation and no other person including his wife, mother, son or any other relation of the 2nd party shall be entitled to use the said premises without the written permission of the 1st party/ landlord-owner.

36. The appellant has himself conceded to not taking his wife to the rented premises.  This further reinforces the testimony of the respondent that he never had any intention to take her to the matrimonial home.
37. The appellant himself has further deposed that in the first week of November, 1995 the respondent along with her father, visited the house of in-laws of his sister.  According to the respondent she had gone there with an endeavour to seek their intervention for reconciliation of inter-se differences between the appellant and the respondent and to convince the appellant to take her back in the matrimonial home.  This incident has been explained by the respondent in her evidence wherein she has deposed that as soon as she reached the house of the father-in-law of the sister of the appellant, the appellant and his brother reached there  and threw out the respondent and her father and even abused them.
38. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation continued further when on 18.11.1995, she met the Head of the Union of which the mother of the appellant was a member, but there also she did not succeed.  
39. The appellant in his affidavit of evidence has denied the visit of the respondent in the office on 11.08.1995, but admitted that she with the small child, had come to his office on 24.11.1995 and had met his Officer Ms. Reva Nayyar, Joint Secretary who counseled them both and told the appellant to take the respondent and the child, to his house.  It is admitted by the appellant that while they were on their way to his house in the TSR, he got out mid way and left.  The explanation given by him is that the respondent had directed the TSR driver to go to the Police Station to get him arrested and because of the fear of getting arrested, he got off mid way.  The respondent on the other hand, has explained that after traveling barely 100 meters, the appellant got the TSR stopped and went away because he did not want to take her to his house. This is also corroborated by the fact that the appellant, had miserably failed to prove that he had taken separate premises on rent, as was asserted by him. 
40. The testimony of respondent that she persistently made efforts for reconciliation, emerges as truthful because it is an admitted fact that respondent never made any complaint to any Authority be it Police, Legal Aid or CAW Cell nor did she initiate any litigation till the divorce petition was filed.  
41. It is obvious from the overwhelming evidence as discussed above, that the appellant had no inclination whatsoever to take her back with him. While he had been compelled by Senior Officer to take her along with him, he immediately deserted her mid way by getting out of the TSR.  The admissions of the appellant clearly reflect that he never had any intention to take the respondent back to the matrimonial home and has not been able to explain any circumstance for his apprehension to let the respondent be with him in his house.
42. The efforts of the respondent for reconciliation and to be able to go back to the matrimonial home did not end only with an endeavour to contact the superior Office of the appellant to intervene.  
43. She admittedly along with her father and brother, took a bus to Chandigarh to meet Mr. Kharbanda, maternal uncle of the appellant who had influence on the family of the appellant, as admitted by him in cross-examination.  Dr. Vinod Narang, cousin brother of appellant was also traveling on the same bus.  The respondent has deposed that she had talked to Dr. Vinod Narang on the way to Chandigarh, but he expressed his inability to be able to intervene in their matter because he felt that the family of the appellant would not pay heed to his advice.  She made all efforts by approaching the family members of the appellant, but did not meet any success.  
44. Her efforts for reconciliation did not end there.  Admittedly, she continued her efforts and eventually a meeting was organized on 31.07.1997 at the Clinic of Dr. Takkar, friend of the appellants father at Paschim Vihar, Delhi.  A second meeting at the Clinic took place on 11.09.1997 but it did not yield any result because as per the testimony of the respondent, the appellant and his father were absolutely adamant on not taking her to the matrimonial home.  
45. The entire evidence, which is essentially not disputed but is admitted by the appellant thus, proves that the appellant at every point of time resisted the reconciliatory efforts made by the respondent and despite persistent efforts of the respondent did not permit her to join him in the matrimonial home.  The appellant has also not been able to explain the reason why he never went to meet the respondent or make any effort to bring her back.
46. In order to be able to succeed to prove desertion, two ingredients are essential : Factum Deserdendi and Animus Deserendi i.e. the factum of separation, and the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end as held in the case of Bipinchandra Jaisinghbhai Shah vs. Prabhavati 1956 SCC OnLine SC 15. 
47. In the present case, there is no evidence whatsoever to prove that the respondent had shifted out of the matrimonial home; without any reasonable excuse rather it is established that the appellant compelled her to shift out It is also not proved that the respondent had any animus or intention to leave the matrimonial home.  The appellant has miserably failed to prove that the respondent had deserted the appellant. The appellant was thus, rightly denied divorce on the ground of Desertion under S.13 (1) (ib) of HMA, 1955 by the Ld. ADJ, Delhi.  

Conclusion:-
48. We are conscious that this is a broken marriage where parties are residing separately for about 30 years and there is no possibility of reunion between the parties. It is a case where the marriage is dead but in recognition of the principle under S.23 (1)(a) HMA,1955, to grant a Divorce in the present case would be to add a premium to the recalcitrant and unreasonable conduct of the appellant in unilaterally refusing to discharge his matrimonial obligations and has indeed caused undefinable cruelty to the respondent by denying her the conjugality without any fault. 
49. We hereby conclude from the aforesaid discussion that the divorce petition of the appellant on the ground of cruelty and desertion under S.13(1)(ia) and (ib) HMA,1955 has been rightly dismissed by the learned Additional District Judge and does not call for any interference.
50. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with pending application(s), if any.

O.A.76/2022  (Chambers Appeal under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High 
Court Rules on behalf of Defendant NO.4 against the Order Dated 
31.05.2022 ) 
 
7. The Chamber Appeal  bearing  No. 38/2022  has been filed under 
Chapter II  Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read 
with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3  for 
recalling/modification/setting -aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which 
the learned Joint Registrar has closed the rig ht of the defendants to file a 
Written Statement,  by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the 
date of service, has already expired.  
8. It is asserted in the application that the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 
entered appearance in the captioned Suit o n 14.01.2022  however, due to the 
peak of Covid P andemic, the Written Statement could not be filed. Further, 
as per the Order dated 10.01.2022 passed by the Supreme Court in Suo Moto  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 3 of 9 
 Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020 , the period from 15.03.2020 to 
28.02. 2022 stood excluded for the purposes of limitation and a further 
period of 90 days was provided in cases where the limitation stood expired 
between 15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. Thus, the defendants Nos. 1,2 and 3 
believed that they had upto 30.05.2020 to fil ed their Written Statement.  
9. It is also submitted that on 31.05.2022, the Written Statement could 
not be filed on their behalf as defendant No.2 was out of town. The learned 
Counsel on their behalf had appeared on 31.05.2022 and requested the Court 
to grant  them three days time to file the Written Statement however, their 
right to file the same was closed by the learned Joint Registrar.  It is 
submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 14.07.2022 and the same 
may be permitted to be taken on record.  
10. Aggrieved by the O rder, the Appeal has been preferred.  
11. The Chamber Appeal bearing No. 76/2022   has been filed under 
Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read 
with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant No. 4 for 
recalling /modification/setting -aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which 
the learned Joint Registrar has closed the right of the defendant to file a 
Written Statement, by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the 
date of service, has already expired . 
12. It is asserted in the application that vide Order dated 14.01.2022, the 
defendant No.4 was directed to file the Written Statement within 4 weeks.  
However, due to the bad health of the applicant/defendant No.4, the same 
was not finalised in time and on 3 1.05.2022, the defendant No. 4 requested 
the learned Joint Registrar for a further time of four weeks to file the Written 
Statement. However, the same was declined and the right of the defendant  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 4 of 9 
 No.4 to file a Written Statement was closed vide Order dated 31.05.2022.  
13. It is submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 25.07.2022 
however the same was put under objection and the same was re -filed after 
removing the objections; the same may be permitted to be taken on record.  
14. Aggrieved by the Order dated 3 1.05.2022, the present Appeal has 
been preferred.  The medical record of defendant No4 has also been filed.  
15. Submissions heard.  
16. The moot issue which arises for determination  in both the applications 
is whether in a regular Civil Suit, the timeline of 120 day s as prescribed 
under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC, 1908 read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the 
Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 can be extended beyond the 
said timeline.  
17. Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC provides that the defendant shall file its 
Written Stat ement w ithin 30 days from the date of service of summons upon 
him which may be extended by 90 days for sufficient reasons.; i.e. defendant 
may be given a maximum of 120 days for filing the Written Statement.  
18. Likewise, Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High C ourt (Original Side) 
Rules, 2018 provides for the extension that can be granted by courts if the 
Written Statement is not filed within 30 days of being served. The provision 
reads as  under:  
“4. Extension of time for filing written statement .--If the 
Court is satisfied that the defendant was prevented by 
sufficient cause for exceptional and unavoidable reasons in 
filing the written statement within 30 days, it may extend the 
time for filing the same by a further period not exceeding 90 
days, but not thereaft er. For such extension of time, the party 
in delay shall be burdened with costs as deemed appropriate.  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 5 of 9 
 The written statement shall not be taken on record unless such 
costs have been paid/ deposited. In case the defendant fails to 
file the affidavit of admi ssion/ denial of documents filed by the 
plaintiff, the documents filed by the plaintiff shall be deemed to 
be admitted. In case, no written statement is filed within the 
extended time also, the Registrar may pass orders for closing 
the right to file the wr itten statement. ” 
 
19. The above provision  of Delhi High Court Rules also provide s that a 
total period of 120 days can be granted for filing a Written Statement.  
20. The entire gravamen rests on the interpretation of the words “ but not 
thereafter ” which finds a co nspicuous place of mention in Chapter VII Rule 
4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018.  
21. In the case of Gautam Gambir v. M/s. Jai Ambe Traders and Ors.  
273(2020) DLT 49 , this Court emphasized on the words “but not 
thereafter ” mentioned in the Rule 4, of Chapter VII of the Delhi High Court 
Rules, 2018, to observe that these words clearly indicate that a total of 120 
days granted for filing of written statement cannot be extended, and if the 
same is not complied with, then the Registrar may pass orders closing the 
right to file the same.  
22. In the case of  Ram Sarup Lugani  v. Nirmal Lugani  276 (2021) DLT 
681(DB ), the Division Bench of this Court upheld the Delhi High Court 
(Original) Rules, 2018 to hold that the said Rules shall prevail over the Code 
of Civil Procedure. The inherent powers contemplated in Chapter I Rule 16 
of the said Rules are not to be exercised over to overcome or circumvent the 
limitation expressly provided under Chapter VII of the Rules. The phrase 
“but not thereafter ”, though in the context of filing of a Replication, was 
interpreted and it was observed that the words  not thereafter  must clearly be  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 6 of 9 
 accorded due weight and the timeline provided could not be extended by the 
Courts or take the replication on record after the time has  been exhausted by 
the party.  
23. This aspect was comprehensively considered by the Coordinate Bench 
of this Court in the c ase of Ms Charu Agrawal v. Mr Alok Kalia & Ors.  
Neutra l Citation No. 2023/DHC/001454 . It was observed that neither Order 
VIII CPC nor any  other provisions in the Code employ the phrase “but not 
thereafter”. This expression stands enshrined in both Rules 4 and 5 of the 
Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018. It was further held that the 
usage of this expression was indicative of a term inal point beyond which it 
was impermissible to accept the Written Statement. The inherent powers of 
the Court cannot be invoked to condone any delay beyond 120 days, in light 
of the emphatic language of the provision itself. The court relied on the case 
of  Ram Sarup Lugani  (supra) to observe that the phrase “ but not thereafter ” 
must clearly be accorded due weight.  
24. The Co -ordinate Bench of this Court in Ms. Charu Agarwal  (supra), 
considered the entire compendium of the judgments on this aspect to 
reiterate  that there cannot be an extension of period of 120 days for the filing 
of the Written Statement.  
25. The Co -ordinate Bench in Col Ashish Khanna SM Retd vs. Delhi 
Gymkhana Club & Ors . CS(OS) 171/22, decided on 21.08.2023, while 
considering the similar controve rsy relied upon the case of Ms.Charu 
Agrawal (Supra); Ram Sarup Lugani  (Supra) and Harjyoti Singh vs. 
Manpreet Kaur , 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2629, to  observe  the inviolability of 
the hard stop period of 120 days prescribed in Chapter VII, Rule 4 of the 
Delhi H igh Court  Rules, 2018, for filing of Written Statement and concluded  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 7 of 9 
 that the debate of the power of the Court to condone the delay in filing the 
written statement beyond 120 days in a non - commercial suit, has been 
settled and the Courts have no power to condone this delay beyond 120 
days.  
26. In view of the above discussed law, it is evident that in view of Order 
VIII Rule 1 CPC read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court 
(Original Side) Rules, 2018, only a maximum extension of 90 days can be 
granted  beyond the initial 30 days, which however is not a matter of right. 
Further, the words ""but not thereafter”  makes it unequivocally clear that in 
no circumstance can an extension beyond 120 (30 + 90) days, can be 
granted.  
Analysis:  
27. Perusal of the record s hows that the Suit for Declaration, Specific 
Performance and Permanent and Perpetual Injunction was filed by the 
Plaintiffs on 15.11.2019. The summons in the Suit was served upon the 
defendant  Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on 10.12.2021 and on defendant No.4 on 
16.12.20 21. 
28. It is pertinent to note that defendant No.1 is the Ajay Kumar , HUF  
and the defendant No 2 is Mr. Ajay Gupta and their  summons was served 
upon   Defendant No.3, Mrs. Nina Gupta who is the wife of Defendant No.2 
Mr Ajay Gupta .  
29. Furthe r, the summons was se rved upon defendant No.4 through his 
wife Kiran Gupta.  
30.  Order 5 Rule 15, CPC , provides that if the defendant is absent from 
his residence at the time when the service of summons is sought to be 
effected on him at his residence, he may be served through any  adult  
CS(OS)598/2019                                                                                                           Page 8 of 9 
 member of the family whether male or female, who is residing with him . 
31. There is no denial by defendant No. 1 and 2 that the summons were 
received by the wife or that they had no knowledge of the summons. In fact, 
the same counsel had appeared on beh alf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 
which shows that the summons was validly served upon them on 
10.12.2021 . Admittedly, all the three defendant  Nos. 1, 2 and 3  had put in 
appearance through their counsel for the first time on 14.01.2022. Having 
been serv ed on 10.12.2021 , they should have filed the Written Statem ent 
within 120 days i.e. upto 09.04.2021 .  
32. Similarly, the service has also not been disputed by defendant No.4 
and having been served on 16.12.2021, the Written Statement should have 
been filed on his behalf within 120 days as well i.e. upto 15.04.2021.  
33. However, t his period came within the COVID -19 Pandemic period 
and in view of the decision in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020  
(Supra),  the period of limitation for cases where limitation expired in 
between 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022  was extended by 90 days from  
01.03.2022, i.e. till 30.05.2022.  However , the Written Statement has not 
even been filed  in that extended period  by the defendant nos. 1,2,3, and 4 . 
34. Admittedly , the Written Statemen t had been filed on behalf of 
defendant nos. 1,2 and 3 only on 1 4.07.2022  but a perusal of the noting 
shows that the same was also returned under objections . Similarly,  the 
defendant No.4 has filed the Wr itten Statement on 21.07.2022 but the s ame 
was retur ned under objections .  
35. Evidently, t he applicant s/defendant No s. 1,2 3 and 4 have failed to file 
the Written Statement  within the period of 120 days which is not extendable 
beyond the def ined period , as discussed above.

 36. Therefore, the Application s are witho ut any merit and hereby 
dismissed.

J U D G M E N T  (oral)

I.A.14204/2022 (under Section 151 CPC on behalf of the plaintiff)
5. The present application is infructuous.
6. The application is accordingly disposed of.
O.A.38/2022 (Chamber Appeal on behalf of Defendant Nos.1 to 3 under Chapter II, Rule 5 of Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Section 151 CPC for Recall/Setting Aside of the Order Dated 31.05.2022 closing the right of the defendants to file a Written Statement)

O.A.76/2022 (Chambers Appeal under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court Rules on behalf of Defendant NO.4 against the Order Dated 31.05.2022)

7. The Chamber Appeal bearing No. 38/2022 has been filed under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for recalling/modification/setting-aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which the learned Joint Registrar has closed the right of the defendants to file a Written Statement, by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the date of service, has already expired.
8. It is asserted in the application that the defendant Nos. 1,2 and 3 entered appearance in the captioned Suit on 14.01.2022  however, due to the peak of Covid Pandemic, the Written Statement could not be filed. Further, as per the Order dated 10.01.2022 passed by the Supreme Court in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020, the period from 15.03.2020 to 28.02.2022 stood excluded for the purposes of limitation and a further period of 90 days was provided in cases where the limitation stood expired between 15.03.2020 and 28.02.2022. Thus, the defendants Nos. 1,2 and 3 believed that they had upto 30.05.2020 to filed their Written Statement.
9. It is also submitted that on 31.05.2022, the Written Statement could not be filed on their behalf as defendant No.2 was out of town. The learned Counsel on their behalf had appeared on 31.05.2022 and requested the Court to grant them three days time to file the Written Statement however, their right to file the same was closed by the learned Joint Registrar. It is submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 14.07.2022 and the same may be permitted to be taken on record.
10. Aggrieved by the Order, the Appeal has been preferred.
11. The Chamber Appeal bearing No. 76/2022  has been filed under Chapter II Rule 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 read with Section 151 CPC, on behalf of the defendant No. 4 for recalling/modification/setting-aside the Order dated 31.05.2022, vide which the learned Joint Registrar has closed the right of the defendant to file a Written Statement, by observing that the statutory period 120 days, from the date of service, has already expired.
12. It is asserted in the application that vide Order dated 14.01.2022, the defendant No.4 was directed to file the Written Statement within 4 weeks.  However, due to the bad health of the applicant/defendant No.4, the same was not finalised in time and on 31.05.2022, the defendant No. 4 requested the learned Joint Registrar for a further time of four weeks to file the Written Statement. However, the same was declined and the right of the defendant No.4 to file a Written Statement was closed vide Order dated 31.05.2022.
13. It is submitted that the Written Statement was filed on 25.07.2022 however the same was put under objection and the same was re-filed after removing the objections; the same may be permitted to be taken on record.
14. Aggrieved by the Order dated 31.05.2022, the present Appeal has been preferred. The medical record of defendant No4 has also been filed.
15. Submissions heard.
16. The moot issue which arises for determination in both the applications is whether in a regular Civil Suit, the timeline of 120 days as prescribed under Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC, 1908 read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 can be extended beyond the said timeline.
17. Order VIII Rule 1 of CPC provides that the defendant shall file its Written Statement within 30 days from the date of service of summons upon him which may be extended by 90 days for sufficient reasons.; i.e. defendant may be given a maximum of 120 days for filing the Written Statement.
18. Likewise, Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018 provides for the extension that can be granted by courts if the Written Statement is not filed within 30 days of being served. The provision reads as under:
4. Extension of time for filing written statement.--If the Court is satisfied that the defendant was prevented by sufficient cause for exceptional and unavoidable reasons in filing the written statement within 30 days, it may extend the time for filing the same by a further period not exceeding 90 days, but not thereafter. For such extension of time, the party in delay shall be burdened with costs as deemed appropriate. The written statement shall not be taken on record unless such costs have been paid/ deposited. In case the defendant fails to file the affidavit of admission/ denial of documents filed by the plaintiff, the documents filed by the plaintiff shall be deemed to be admitted. In case, no written statement is filed within the extended time also, the Registrar may pass orders for closing the right to file the written statement.

19. The above provision of Delhi High Court Rules also provides that a total period of 120 days can be granted for filing a Written Statement.
20. The entire gravamen rests on the interpretation of the words but not thereafter which finds a conspicuous place of mention in Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018.
21. In the case of Gautam Gambir v. M/s. Jai Ambe Traders and Ors. 273(2020) DLT 49, this Court emphasized on the words but not thereafter mentioned in the Rule 4, of Chapter VII of the Delhi High Court Rules, 2018, to observe that these words clearly indicate that a total of 120 days granted for filing of written statement cannot be extended, and if the same is not complied with, then the Registrar may pass orders closing the right to file the same.
22. In the case of Ram Sarup Lugani v. Nirmal Lugani 276 (2021) DLT 681(DB), the Division Bench of this Court upheld the Delhi High Court (Original) Rules, 2018 to hold that the said Rules shall prevail over the Code of Civil Procedure. The inherent powers contemplated in Chapter I Rule 16 of the said Rules are not to be exercised over to overcome or circumvent the limitation expressly provided under Chapter VII of the Rules. The phrase but not thereafter, though in the context of filing of a Replication, was interpreted and it was observed that the words not thereafter must clearly be accorded due weight and the timeline provided could not be extended by the Courts or take the replication on record after the time has been exhausted by the party.
23. This aspect was comprehensively considered by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of Ms Charu Agrawal v. Mr Alok Kalia & Ors. Neutral Citation No. 2023/DHC/001454. It was observed that neither Order VIII CPC nor any other provisions in the Code employ the phrase but not thereafter. This expression stands enshrined in both Rules 4 and 5 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018. It was further held that the usage of this expression was indicative of a terminal point beyond which it was impermissible to accept the Written Statement. The inherent powers of the Court cannot be invoked to condone any delay beyond 120 days, in light of the emphatic language of the provision itself. The court relied on the case of  Ram Sarup Lugani (supra) to observe that the phrase but not thereafter must clearly be accorded due weight.
24. The Co-ordinate Bench of this Court in Ms. Charu Agarwal (supra), considered the entire compendium of the judgments on this aspect to reiterate that there cannot be an extension of period of 120 days for the filing of the Written Statement.
25. The Co-ordinate Bench in Col Ashish Khanna SM Retd vs. Delhi Gymkhana Club & Ors. CS(OS) 171/22, decided on 21.08.2023, while considering the similar controversy relied upon the case of Ms.Charu Agrawal (Supra); Ram Sarup Lugani (Supra) and Harjyoti Singh vs. Manpreet Kaur, 2021 SCC OnLine Del 2629, to observe the inviolability of the hard stop period of 120 days prescribed in Chapter VII, Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court Rules, 2018, for filing of Written Statement and concluded that the debate of the power of the Court to condone the delay in filing the written statement beyond 120 days in a non- commercial suit, has been settled and the Courts have no power to condone this delay beyond 120 days.
26. In view of the above discussed law, it is evident that in view of Order VIII Rule 1 CPC read with Chapter VII Rule 4 of the Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules, 2018, only a maximum extension of 90 days can be granted beyond the initial 30 days, which however is not a matter of right. Further, the words ""but not thereafter makes it unequivocally clear that in no circumstance can an extension beyond 120 (30 + 90) days, can be granted. 
Analysis:
27. Perusal of the record shows that the Suit for Declaration, Specific Performance and Permanent and Perpetual Injunction was filed by the Plaintiffs on 15.11.2019. The summons in the Suit was served upon the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 on 10.12.2021 and on defendant No.4 on 16.12.2021.
28. It is pertinent to note that defendant No.1 is the Ajay Kumar, HUF and the defendant No 2 is Mr. Ajay Gupta and their summons was served upon  Defendant No.3, Mrs. Nina Gupta who is the wife of Defendant No.2 Mr Ajay Gupta. 
29. Further, the summons was served upon defendant No.4 through his wife Kiran Gupta.
30.  Order 5 Rule 15, CPC, provides that if the defendant is absent from his residence at the time when the service of summons is sought to be effected on him at his residence, he may be served through any adult member of the family whether male or female, who is residing with him.
31. There is no denial by defendant No. 1 and 2 that the summons were received by the wife or that they had no knowledge of the summons. In fact, the same counsel had appeared on behalf of the defendant Nos. 1, 2 and 3 which shows that the summons was validly served upon them on 10.12.2021.

33. However, this period came within the COVID-19 Pandemic period and in view of the decision in Suo Moto Writ Petition (Civil) No. 3 of 2020 (Supra), the period of limitation for cases where limitation expired in between 15.03.2020 till 28.02.2022 was extended by 90 days from 01.03.2022, i.e. till 30.05.2022. However, the Written Statement has not even been filed in that extended period by the defendant nos. 1,2,3, and 4.
34. Admittedly, the Written Statement had been filed on behalf of defendant nos. 1,2 and 3 only on 14.07.2022 but a perusal of the noting shows that the same was also returned under objections. Similarly, the defendant No.4 has filed the Written Statement on 21.07.2022 but the same was returned under objections. 
35. Evidently, the applicants/defendant Nos. 1,2 3 and 4 have failed to file the Written Statement within the period of 120 days which is not extendable beyond the defined period, as discussed above.
36. Therefore, the Applications are without any merit and hereby dismissed.
